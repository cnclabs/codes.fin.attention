item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition gtl is a holding company that acts as a general partner of globalstar and has no other business 
the company s sole asset is its investment in globalstar and gtl s results of operations reflect its share of the results of operations of globalstar on an equity accounting basis 
accordingly  management s discussion and analysis addresses the financial condition and results of operations of globalstar 
in its annual and quarterly reports  gtl presents separate financial statements for gtl and globalstar 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  and elsewhere in this form k  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which may be beyond globalstar s control 
these may include  but are not limited to  problems relating to technical development of the system  testing  regulatory compliance  manufacturing and assembly  the competitive and regulatory environment in which globalstar will operate  marketing problems and costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates 
the actual results that globalstar achieves may differ materially from any forward looking projections due to such risks and uncertainties 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents increased to million from million at december  the net increase is a result of the net proceeds of billion received from issuance of globalstar s  and senior notes  million received from the sale of warrants to gtl and  million received from the exercise of certain warrants issued in connection with the globalstar credit agreement and subscription rights issued by gtl  offset by expenditures for the globalstar system under construction of million  expenditures for the additional spare satellites of million  the net cash used in operating activities of million  preferred distributions on the redeemable preferred partnership interests of million and net repayments of debt of million 
accounts payable  payables to affiliates  accrued expenses and accrued interest on senior notes payable increased by as compared to the prior year  to million at december   as a result of the timing of payments to globalstar contractors and accrued interest on the senior notes 
through december   globalstar incurred costs of approximately billion for the design and construction of the space and ground segments 
costs incurred during fiscal year were approximately million 
as of december   globalstar estimates the cost for the design  construction and deployment of the globalstar system  including working capital  cash interest on borrowings and operating expenses to be approximately billion  as compared with approximately billion estimated at december  actual amounts may vary from this estimate and additional funds would be required in the event of unforeseen delays  cost overruns  launch failures  technological risks  adverse regulatory developments  or to meet unanticipated expenses and for system enhancements and measures to assure system performance and readiness for the space and ground segments 
in order to accelerate the deployment of gateways around the world  globalstar has agreed to finance approximately million of the cost of up to of the initial gateways 
globalstar expects to recover this financing upon resale of such gateways to its partners and service providers 
in addition  globalstar has agreed to purchase from ss l eight additional spare satellites for approximately million that will increase globalstar s ability to have at least satellites in service during  even in the event of launch failures 
if the launch program is successful  the additional satellites will serve as ground spares  readily available for launch to replenish the constellation as needed to respond to satellite attrition during the first generation  or to increase system capacity as required 
if globalstar were to experience a launch failure  the costs associated with the construction and launch of replacements would be substantially covered by insurance 
in december  an order for  fixed access terminals totalling million was placed with ericsson 
globalstar expects to recover the cost of these terminals through resale to vendors 
on march   holders of warrants issued in connection with the globalstar credit agreement exercised warrants to purchase  shares of gtl common stock for per share 
gtl received proceeds of approximately million 
on may   gtl received proceeds of approximately million as a result of the exercise of rights issued to purchase  shares of gtl common stock for per share 
gtl used the total proceeds of million to purchase  globalstar ordinary partnership interests for per interest 
net proceeds from the exercise of the warrants and rights will be used for the construction and deployment of the globalstar system 
on february   globalstar and gtl sold units consisting of million aggregate principal amount of globalstar s senior notes due and warrants to purchase  shares of gtl common stock in a private offering as adjusted for two for one stock split 
on june  and october   globalstar sold million principal amount of senior notes and million principal amount of senior notes  respectively  both due net proceeds from these offerings and the issuance of the warrants totalled billion and will be used for the construction and deployment of the globalstar system 
as of december  globalstar had raised or received commitments for approximately billion 
globalstar believes that its current capital  vendor financing commitments and the availability of the globalstar credit agreement million available at december   are sufficient to fund its requirements into the fourth quarter of globalstar intends to raise the remaining funds required to complete the globalstar system from a combination of sources  including debt issuance which may include an equity component  financial support from the globalstar partners  projected service provider payments  projected net service revenues from initial operations  and anticipated payments from the sale of gateways and globalstar subscriber terminals 
although globalstar believes it will be able to obtain these additional funds  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
results of operations comparison of results for the years ended december  and globalstar is a development stage partnership and has not commenced commercial operations 
for the period march  commencement of operations to december   globalstar has recorded cumulative net losses applicable to ordinary partnership interests of million 
the net loss for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  due to an increase in total operating costs partially offset by an increase in interest income 
the net loss applicable to ordinary partnership interests was million during the current period reflecting million of preferred distributions on the redeemable preferred partnership interests 
globalstar is expending significant funds for the design  construction  testing and deployment of the globalstar system and expects such losses to continue until commencement of commercial operations 
globalstar has earned interest income of million on cash balances and short term investments since commencement of operations 
interest income during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income for the current period increased as a result of higher average cash balances available for investment during operating expenses 
development costs of million for the year ended december  represent the development of globalstar user terminals and globalstar s continuing in house engineering 
this compares with million of development costs incurred during the increase during is primarily the result of the increased activity in the development of the globalstar user terminals 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million incurred during the year ended december  the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees  as globalstar gears up for operations and increased advertising costs 
depreciation 
globalstar intends to capitalize all costs  including interest as applicable  associated with the design  construction and deployment of the globalstar system  except costs associated with the development of the globalstar phones and certain technologies under a cost sharing arrangement with qualcomm 
globalstar will not record depreciation expense on the globalstar system under construction until the commencement of commercial operations  as assets are placed into service 
income taxes 
globalstar was organized as a limited partnership 
as such  no income tax provision benefit is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since us income taxes are the responsibility of its partners 
generally  taxable income loss  deductions and credits of globalstar will be passed through to its partners 
comparison of results for the years ended december  and the net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  due to a decrease in development costs partially offset by a decrease in interest income 
the net loss applicable to ordinary partnership interests was million during reflecting million of preferred distributions on the redeemable preferred partnership interests 
interest income during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income for decreased as a result of lower average cash balances available for investment during operating expenses 
development costs of million for the year ended december   represent the development of certain technologies under a cost sharing arrangement in globalstar s contract with qualcomm  the development of globalstar phones and globalstar s continuing in house engineering 
this compares with million of development costs incurred during the decline during is primarily the result of the cost sharing arrangement in globalstar s contract with qualcomm reaching its funding limit in april marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million incurred during the year ended december  certain factors that may affect future results this annual report of form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in addition  from time to time  globalstar  gtl or their representatives have made or may make forward looking statements  orally or in writing 
such forward looking statements may be included in  but are not limited to  various filings made by gtl with the securities and exchange commission  press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of gtl or globalstar 
actual results could differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward looking statements as a result of a wide variety of factors and conditions  including  but not limited to  the factors summarized below 
development stage company globalstar is a development stage company and has no operating history 
from its inception  globalstar has incurred net losses and expects such losses to continue 
globalstar requires expenditure of significant funds for development  construction  testing and deployment before commercialization of the globalstar system 
globalstar expects to commence commercial operations in early and to have positive cash flow in the second half of there can be no assurance that globalstar will achieve its objectives by the targeted dates 
as of december   globalstar estimates the cost for the design  construction and deployment of the globalstar system  including working capital  cash interest on borrowings and operating expenses  to be approximately billion 
actual amounts may vary from this estimate and additional funds would be required in the event of unforeseen delays  cost overruns  launch failures  technological risks or adverse regulatory developments  or to meet unanticipated expenses 
ground segment costs  most of which are incurred under a cost plus contract with qualcomm  have increased as a result of added enhanced capabilities  additional test requirements and cost growth in the development of the ground system 
as of december   globalstar had raised or received commitments for approximately billion in equity  debt and vendor financing 
globalstar believes that its current capital  vendor financing commitments  and the availability of the globalstar credit agreement are sufficient to fund its requirements into the fourth quarter of globalstar intends to raise the remaining funds required from a combination of sources including debt issuance which may include an equity component  financial support from the globalstar partners  projected service provider payments  projected net service revenues from initial operations and anticipated payments received from the sale of gateways and globalstar subscriber terminals 
although globalstar believes it will be able to obtain these additional funds  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
if there are unforeseen delays  if technical or regulatory developments result in a need to modify the design of all or a portion of the globalstar system  if service provider agreements for additional territories are not entered into at the times or on the terms anticipated by globalstar or if other additional costs are incurred  the risk of which is substantial  additional capital will be required 
a substantial shortfall in meeting its capital needs would prevent completion of the globalstar system 
the ability of globalstar to achieve positive cash flow will depend upon the successful and timely construction and deployment of the globalstar system  the successful marketing of its services by service providers and the ability of the globalstar system to successfully compete against other satellite based telecommunications systems  as to which there can be no assurance 
many of the problems  delays and expenses encountered by an enterprise in globalstar s stage of development may be beyond globalstar s control 
these may include  but are not limited to  problems related to technical development of the system  testing  regulatory compliance  manufacturing and assembly  the competitive and regulatory environment in which globalstar will operate  marketing problems and costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates 
delay in the timely construction  deployment  commercial operation and achievement of positive cash flow of the globalstar system could result from a variety of causes 
these include delays in the regulatory process in various jurisdictions  delay in the integration of the globalstar system into the land based network  changes in the technical specifications of the globalstar system made to enhance its features  performance or marketability or in response to regulatory developments or otherwise  delays encountered in the construction  integration or testing of the globalstar system by globalstar vendors  delayed or unsuccessful launches  delays in financing  insufficient or ineffective service provider marketing efforts  slower than anticipated consumer acceptance of globalstar service and other events beyond globalstar s control 
substantial delays in any of the foregoing matters would delay globalstar s achievement of profitable operations 
regulation the operations of the globalstar system are and will continue to be subject to united states and foreign regulation 
in order to operate in the united states and on an international basis  the globalstar system must be authorized to provide mss in each of the markets in which its service providers intend to operate 
even though a globalstar affiliate has received a fcc authorization  there can be no assurance that the further regulatory approvals required for worldwide operations will be obtained  or that they will be obtained in a timely manner or in the form necessary to implement globalstar s proposed operations 
globalstar s business may also be significantly affected by regulatory changes resulting from judicial decisions and or adoption of treaties  legislation or regulation by the national authorities where the globalstar system plans to operate 
globalstar s fcc license  as modified on november   authorizes the construction  launch and operation of the satellite constellation and assigns the system user links and feeder links in the united states 
globalstar s feeder link frequencies were allocated internationally at wrc  and have been assigned by the fcc for use in the united states in accordance with the international allocation 
however  use of the feeder link frequencies remains subject to restrictions that may be adopted in a potential fcc proceeding to adopt the international allocations into the us table of frequency allocations 
in january  the fcc adopted rules for the use of a portion of the frequencies allocated at wrc for mss feeder links such as globalstar s to a proposed high speed wireless data service 
although these rules are intended to preclude harmful interference with other uses of these bands  they may ultimately permit uses of these frequencies that could diminish their usefulness for mss feeder links 
separate licenses must also be obtained from the fcc for operation of gateways and globalstar phones in the united states 
to the extent that other recently licensed mss systems that use the spectrum for which globalstar has been authorized acquire the financial resources necessary to construct and launch their proposed systems and such systems become operational  the globalstar system s capacity would be reduced 
in addition  globalstar s fcc license is subject to a pending judicial appeal 
while globalstar believes that this appeal is without merit  there can be no assurance that this appeal will not result in either reversal or stay of the fcc s decision to grant globalstar s fcc license to lqp or ultimately result in the granting of additional licenses by the fcc or its adoption of an auction procedure to award licenses  which might materially increase the cost of obtaining such licenses 
authorization will be required in each country in which globalstar user terminals are used and in which globalstar s gateways are located 
local regulatory approval for operation of the globalstar system is the responsibility of the service providers in each territory 
although many countries have moved to privatize the provision of telecommunications service and to permit competition in the provision of such service  some countries continue to require that all telecommunications service be provided by a government owned entity 
while service providers have been selected  in part  based upon their perceived qualifications to obtain the requisite local approvals  there can be no assurance that they will be successful in doing so  and if they are not successful  globalstar service will not be available in such territories 
in that event  depending upon geographical and market considerations  globalstar may or may not have the ability to redirect the system capacity that such territories would have otherwise used to serve markets in which service is authorized 
regulatory schemes in countries in which globalstar or its service providers seek to operate may impose impediments on globalstar s operations 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions would not be unduly burdensome 
glonass  the russian global navigation satellite system  operates worldwide in a portion of the frequency band proposed to be used by globalstar and other mss systems for user uplinks 
although glonass has proposed to migrate to lower frequencies  there can be no assurance that such migration will be implemented in a manner fully acceptable to globalstar 
in addition  there are requirements for interference protection between globalstar and glonass under consideration  which  if adopted  may render a segment of the mss spectrum unusable for mss user uplinks 
while any likely limitation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on globalstar s capacity  nevertheless  these actions may have the effect of reducing globalstar capacity in some markets 
european union competition law proscribes agreements that restrict or distort competition in the european union 
globalstar and others have responded to an inquiry from the commission of the european union requesting information regarding their activities 
a violation of european union competition law could subject globalstar to fines or enforcement actions that could delay service in western europe  and or depending on the circumstances  adversely affect globalstar s contractual rights vis a vis its european strategic partners 
in addition  the commission has proposed legislation which  if adopted  would give the commission broad regulatory authority over satellite telecommunications systems such as the globalstar system 
technological factors the globalstar system is exposed to the risks inherent in a large scale complex telecommunications system employing advanced technologies which must be adapted to the globalstar application and which have never been used as a commercial whole 
deployment of the globalstar satellite constellation involves volume production and testing of satellites in quantities significantly higher than those previously prevailing in the industry 
the integration of a worldwide leo satellite based system like globalstar has never occurred  there is no assurance that such integration will be successfully implemented 
the operation of the globalstar system will require integration of advanced digital communications technologies in devices from personal handsets and public telephone networks to gateways in remote regions of the globe and satellites operating in space 
the failure to develop  produce and implement the system  or any of its diverse and dispersed elements  as required  could delay the in service or full constellation date of the globalstar system or render it unable to perform at levels required for commercial success 
satellite launches are subject to significant risks  including disabling damage to or loss of the satellites 
satellite launches of groups of more than eight commercial satellites have not been attempted before 
historically  launch failure hot failure rates on low earth orbit and geostationary satellite launches have been approximately 
however  launch failure rates vary depending on the particular launch vehicle 
there is no assurance that globalstar satellite launches will be successful or that its launch failure rate will not exceed the industry average 
the boeing delta ii launch vehicle  scheduled to launch the next four satellites  suffered a launch failure on january   its second failure in launches to that date 
boeing resumed delta operations in may and has not had any additional failures 
on february   the first four globalstar satellites were launched aboard a boeing delta ii rocket and were successfully deployed in orbit 
the ukrainian zenit launch vehicle  which is proposed to launch globalstar satellites per launch  has never been used in commercial applications 
a zenit launch vehicle carrying a russian military satellite suffered a launch failure on may  yuzhnoye  the zenit manufacturer  in conjunction with russian space agencies  has investigated  but not yet released its report regarding the cause of this failure  the fourth in this rockets last launches 
two launches are planned on the zenit prior to globalstar s initial launch on this vehicle 
globalstar intends to launch the last satellites of its constellation in groups of four on three separate launches of the russian starsem soyuz rocket 
the zenit launch contracts provide for relaunches at no additional charge in the event of a hot failure 
however  the launch provider may  because of financial reasons or otherwise  be unable to provide such relaunches 
a single launch failure would result in a loss of either four or globalstar satellites 
although the cost of replacing such satellites and launch vehicles will in most cases be covered by insurance  a launch failure could result in delays in the in service or the full constellation date 
ss l has agreed to obtain launch vehicles for globalstar and arrange for the launch of all satellites  subject to pricing adjustments in light of future conditions  which may  in turn  be influenced by international political developments 
an adverse change in launch vehicle market conditions which prohibits globalstar from utilizing the launch vehicles for which it has contracted could result in an increase in the launch cost payable by globalstar  which may be substantial 
in addition  there can be no assurance that replacement launch vehicles will be available in the future at a cost or on terms acceptable to globalstar 
two of the launch operators are subject to us export control regulations 
yuzhnoye  based in ukraine  has certain ties with russia and intends to launch the zenit rocket from the baikonur launch site in kazakhstan 
arianespace  which will be providing the soyuz rockets  also intends to launch from baikonur 
changes in governmental policies or political leadership in the united states  ukraine  russia or kazakhstan could affect the cost  availability  timing or overall advisability of utilizing these launch providers 
while there is no assurance that the necessary export licenses will be obtained  globalstar has provided against the risk that such licenses will not be granted or that the deterioration in the relationships between the united states and these countries may make the use of such launch providers inadvisable by procuring options on sufficient launches with a us based launch provider to launch all the remaining satellites of the globalstar constellation 
if globalstar were to exercise these options for us launches in the wake of the failure to obtain any necessary export licenses or as a result of adverse developments in us relations with these countries  the cost of launching the globalstar satellite constellation would be significantly increased 
a number of factors will affect the useful lives of globalstar s satellites  including the quality of construction  expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels and the durability of component parts 
random failure of satellite components could result in damage to or loss of a satellite cold failures 
in rare cases  satellites could also be damaged or destroyed by electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects 
as a result of these factors  the first generation satellite constellation including spares is designed to operate at full performance for a minimum of years  after which performance is expected to gradually decline 
however  there can be no assurance of the constellation s specific longevity 
globalstar s operating results would be adversely affected in the event the useful life of the satellites were significantly shorter than years 
globalstar anticipates using funds generated from operations to develop a second generation of satellites 
if sufficient funds from operations are not available and globalstar is unable to obtain external financing for the second generation constellation  globalstar will not be able to deploy a second generation satellite constellation to replace first generation satellites at the end of their useful lives 
in that event  the globalstar system would cease operations at that time 
globalstar intends to obtain insurance against launch failure which would cover the cost of relaunch and the replacement cost of lost satellites in the event of hot failures for satellites in its constellation and the eight in orbit spares 
ss l has agreed to obtain on globalstar s behalf insurance for the cost of replacing satellites lost in hot failures  and for any relaunch costs not covered by the applicable launch contract  in certain circumstances subject to pricing adjustments in light of future market conditions 
an adverse change in insurance market conditions may result in an increase in the insurance premium paid by globalstar  which may be substantial 
in addition  there is no assurance that launch insurance will be available or that  if available  would be at a cost or on terms acceptable to globalstar 
globalstar s contract with ss l provides for the construction and launch of eight spare satellites and construction of eight ground spares to minimize the effect of any launch or orbital failures 
however  there can be no assurance that additional satellites and launches will not be required 
in such an event  in addition to the replacement costs incurred by globalstar  globalstar s in service or full constellation date may be delayed 
in addition  unless otherwise required  globalstar does not currently intend to purchase insurance to cover cold failures that may occur once the satellites have been successfully deployed from the launch vehicle 
the space and communications industries are characterized by rapid technological advances and innovations 
there is no assurance that one or more of the technologies utilized or under development by globalstar may not become obsolete  or that its services will be in demand by the time they are offered 
globalstar is dependent upon technologies developed by third parties to implement key aspects of its strategy to integrate its satellite systems with terrestrial networks  and there can be no assurance that such technologies will continue to be available to globalstar on a timely basis or on reasonable terms 
future operating factors the availability of globalstar service in each region or country will depend upon the cooperation  operational and marketing efficiency  competitiveness  finances and regulatory status of globalstar s service provider in that region or country 
the willingness of companies to become service providers will depend upon a variety of factors  including pricing  local regulations and globalstar s competitiveness with other satellite based telecommunications systems 
globalstar believes that enlisting the support of established telecommunications service providers  some of which are the dominant carriers in their markets  will be essential both to obtaining necessary local regulatory approvals and to rapidly accessing a broad market of potential users 
globalstar s strategic service providers have agreed to act as exclusive service providers in countries although it is anticipated that in many cases these partners will enter into strategic alliances with local service providers to provide globalstar service in these countries 
globalstar s partnership agreement restricts its limited partners from possessing certain interests in business activities operating mobile satellite services similar to globalstar for voice telephony 
in addition  the service provider agreements between globalstar and its current service providers preclude any service provider  its affiliates and certain joint ventures in which such service provider owns an equity interest from acting as a service provider or a distributor for a similar satellite service in any territory in respect of which globalstar has agreed to make globalstar service available to such service provider or as a distributor for a similar satellite service in any territory in which one or more service providers are ready  willing and able to permit such service provider to act as a distributor therefor on terms no less favorable than those offered to other distributors  subject to certain exceptions 
except as provided above  globalstar s service providers may enter into certain agreements or relationships with competitors of globalstar 
globalstar currently has no knowledge of any agreements between its service providers and globalstar s competitors in the satellite based personal telecommunications business 
globalstar expects to raise additional funds prior to the full constellation date in the form of service provider payments from prospective service providers in other territories throughout the world 
globalstar s business plan assumes that globalstar will contract with service providers to provide service in the remaining territories of the world  in certain cases  on terms more favorable to globalstar than those contained in its founding service provider agreements 
there can be no assurance that additional service provider agreements will be entered into in the future or that this plan will be achieved 
if such service provider payments are not realized  globalstar will be required to obtain other sources of financing in order to complete the globalstar system 
if the service providers fail to obtain the necessary local regulatory approval or to adequately market and distribute globalstar s services  globalstar s business could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that enough service providers will contract for globalstar service and procure and install the gateways and obtain the regulatory licenses necessary for complete global service 
failure to offer service in any particular region will eliminate that area s market potential and reduce globalstar s ability to service its global roamer market 
certain strategic partners and other third parties are constructing the component parts of the globalstar system 
in the event such parties are unable to perform their obligations  globalstar s in service and full constellation date may be delayed and its costs may be increased 
globalstar expects that a substantial portion of its business will be conducted outside of the united states 
such operations are subject to certain risks such as changes in domestic and foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers 
accordingly  government actions in foreign countries could have a significant effect on globalstar s operations 
political  economic or social instability or other developments in such countries  including currency fluctuations  could also adversely affect globalstar s operations 
in addition  globalstar s agreements relating to local operations may be governed by foreign law or enforceable only in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for globalstar to enforce its rights under such agreements 
globalstar s largest potential markets are in developing countries or regions that are substantially underserved and not expected to be served by existing telecommunications systems 
in doing business in such markets  globalstar and its local service providers may face market  inflation  interest rate and currency fluctuation  government policy  price and wage  exchange control  taxation and social instability  expropriation and other economic  political or diplomatic conditions that are significantly more volatile than those commonly experienced in the united states and other industrialized countries 
although globalstar anticipates that it will receive payments from its service providers in us dollars  limited availability of us currency in these local markets may prevent a service provider from making payments in us dollars 
moreover  exchange rate fluctuations may affect the price globalstar will be entitled to receive for its services 
globalstar s pricing to service providers will  under certain circumstances  not be automatically adjusted for inflation  in such cases  globalstar will be able to increase its pricing to service providers only if the service provider increases its prices to subscribers  and it may be required to lower its pricing if the service provider lowers its prices to subscribers 
in recent years  pricing in the telecommunications industry has trended downward  in some cases making it difficult for service providers to raise their prices to compensate for cost inflation 
although globalstar expects future service provider agreements to contain pricing terms more favorable to globalstar than those contained in its agreements with founding service providers  there can be no assurance that such terms will be achieved 
globalstar has entered into an agreement with a bank syndicate for a million credit facility the globalstar credit agreement expiring december   and also expects to utilize approximately million of committed vendor financing 
existing indebtedness includes the million aggregate principal amount of globalstar s senior notes issued in february the senior notes  the million aggregate principal amount of globalstar s senior notes issued in june the senior notes and the million aggregate principal amount of globalstar s senior notes issued in october the senior notes 
as a result  globalstar is highly leveraged 
globalstar will be dependent on its cash flow from operations to service this debt 
any delay in the commencement of globalstar operations will adversely affect globalstar s ability to service its debt obligations 
the discretion of globalstar s management with respect to certain business matters will be limited by covenants contained in the globalstar credit agreement  the indenture the indenture governing the senior notes  the indenture the indenture governing the senior notes  the indenture the indenture governing the senior notes and future debt instruments 
among other things  the covenants contained in the globalstar credit agreement  the indenture  the indenture and the indenture restrict  condition or prohibit globalstar from paying cash distributions on its ordinary partnership interests  creating liens on its assets  making certain asset dispositions  conducting certain other business and entering into transactions with affiliates and related persons 
in the event the globalstar credit agreement ceases to be guaranteed  it will also contain certain financial covenants limiting the ability of globalstar to incur additional indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that globalstar s leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect globalstar s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
moreover  a failure to comply with the obligations contained in the globalstar credit agreement  the indenture  the indenture and the indenture or any agreements with respect to additional financing could result in an event of default under such agreements  which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under future debt agreements that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
competition in the telecommunications industry is intense  fueled by rapid and continuous technological advances and alliances between industry participants on an international scale 
although no present participant is currently providing the same global personal telecommunications service proposed by globalstar  it is anticipated that one or more additional competing mss systems will be launched and that the success  or anticipated success  of globalstar and its competitors could attract other entrants 
if any of globalstar s competitors succeeds in marketing and deploying its system substantially earlier than globalstar  globalstar s ability to compete in areas served by such competitor may be adversely affected 
a number of satellite based telecommunications systems not involved in the mss proceeding have also been proposed using geostationary satellites and  in one case  the ghz band for an meo system 
globalstar s most direct competitors are the three other mss applicants which currently hold fcc licenses  iridium  mchi ellipso and constellation 
on december   trw announced that it would not construct its previously licensed odyssey system but would instead invest in ico 
as of march   iridium has launched of its satellites 
ico was not an applicant or a licensee in the mss proceeding 
ico has  however  filed a request with the fcc to operate in a different frequency band not available for use by mss systems under current international guidelines in place until comsat  the us signatory to inmarsat  has applied to the fcc to participate in the procurement of facilities of the system proposed by ico 
it has also sought fcc approval of a proposal to extend the scope of services provided by inmarsat  currently limited to maritime services  to include telecommunications services to land based mobile units 
these applications are currently pending before the fcc 
comsat has been instructed in the past by the us government to seek to ensure that ico does not receive preferred access to any market and that non discriminatory access to such areas for all mobile satellite communications networks be established  subject to spectrum coordination and availability 
nonetheless  because ico is affiliated with inmarsat and because its investors include state owned telecommunications monopolies in a number of countries  there can be no assurance that ico might not be given preferential treatment in the local licensing process in those countries 
constellation and mchi were granted fcc licenses in july  after the fcc waived its financial qualification requirements with respect to such applicants 
in granting such licenses  the fcc found that such applicants had failed to demonstrate that they are financially qualified  and it is not certain that they will be able to raise sufficient funds to construct  launch and operate their proposed systems 
even if ultimately built  such systems are not planned to enter the market until significantly after globalstar s targeted in service date 
in addition to competing for investment capital  subscribers and service providers in markets all over the world  the mss systems  including globalstar  also compete with each other for the limited spectrum available for mss operations 
unlike cdma systems such as globalstar  mchi and constellation  which permit multiple systems to operate within the same band  the design of iridium s tdma system requires a separate frequency segment dedicated specifically for its use 
if more than two cdma systems become operational  cdma systems like globalstar will effectively have a smaller spectrum segment within which to operate their user uplinks in the us while cdma permits spectrum sharing among competing systems  the capacity available to each system sharing such spectrum decreases as the number of systems operating in the band increases 
the degree of decrease depends on a number of complex technological factors associated with each system s particular design including transmitter polarization and efficiency of spectrum usage 
if the total number of operating mss systems in the cdma portion of the l band eg  mhz and s band ie  mhz increases from two to three and the other two operating cdma systems have technical characteristics similar to globalstar s and all such systems experience full capacity usage  then globalstar estimates that its capacity over a given area would decrease by approximately 
the fcc has no authority to extend the us band plan for cdma and tdma big leo systems to other countries 
however  it has stated that it plans to express the view in discussions with other administrations that global satellite systems are more likely to succeed if individual administrations adopt complementary systems for licensing them 
the conference of european regulators cept has recommended a band plan virtually identical to the us band plan 
geostationary based satellite systems  including amsc and comsat s planet  are providing  and other proposed geostationary based satellite systems  including apmt  asc  aces  thuraya and satphone  plan to provide satellite based telecommunications services in areas proposed to be serviced by globalstar 
because some of these systems involve relatively simple ground control requirements and are expected to deploy no more than two satellites  they may succeed in deploying and marketing their systems before globalstar 
in addition  coordination of standards among regional geostationary systems could enable these systems to provide worldwide service to their subscriber bases  thereby increasing the competition to globalstar 
for example  comsat has announced a global mobile satellite service planet using existing inmarsat satellites  a six pound  laptop size phone  costing  with an expected per minute usage rate of 
some of these potential competitors have financial  personnel and other resources substantially greater than those of globalstar 
many of these competitors are raising capital and may compete with globalstar for service providers and financing 
technological advances and a continuing trend toward strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry could give rise to significant new competitors 
there can be no assurance that some of these competitors will not provide a more efficient or less expensive service 
however  globalstar believes that based upon the public statements and other publicly available information of the other mss applicants  globalstar will be a low cost provider 
depending on the competitive environment  however  pricing competition could require globalstar to reduce its anticipated pricing to service providers  thus adversely affecting its financial performance 
satellite based telecommunications systems are characterized by high up front costs and relatively low marginal costs of providing service 
several systems are being proposed and  while the proponents of these systems foresee substantial demand for the services they will provide  the actual level of demand will not become known until such systems are constructed  launched and operational 
if the capacity of globalstar and any competing systems exceeds demand  price competition could be particularly intense 
projects such as teledesic  spaceway and cyberstar have each received licenses to operate satellite based telecommunications and video transmission systems in the ghz ka band or higher frequencies 
certain mss applicants  not including globalstar  have applied to use this band for their feeder uplinks  as have proponents of land based local multipoint distribution systems lmds for cellular television services 
the fcc has recently concluded developing service rules and a band width allocation plan for use of the available ka band spectrum by these services 
globalstar s primary business will be voice telephony  and its data transmission business will be focused on small data packet services such as paging and messaging 
it therefore does not regard the television or broadband data services to fixed terminals proposed by teledesic  spaceway and cyberstar or the wireless cable and fixed telephony services proposed by the lmds applicants as competing services 
it is expected that as land based telecommunications services expand to regions currently underserved or not served by wireline or cellular services  demand for globalstar service in those regions may be reduced 
if such systems are constructed at a more rapid rate than that anticipated by globalstar  the demand for globalstar service may be reduced at rates higher than those assumed in globalstar s market analysis 
globalstar may also face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems 
new technology could render globalstar obsolete or less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in alternative ways or through the introduction of incompatible telecommunications standards 
a number of these new technologies  even if they are not ultimately successful  could have an adverse effect on globalstar as a result of their initial marketing efforts 
globalstar s business would be adversely affected if competitors begin operations or existing or new telecommunications service providers penetrate globalstar s target markets before completion of the globalstar system 
subscriber acceptance of the globalstar system both in terms of placement of globalstar phones and subscriber usage thereof will depend upon a number of factors  including price  demand for service and the extent of availability of alternative telecommunications systems 
if the level of actual subscriber demand and usage for globalstar service is below that expected by globalstar  globalstar s cash flow will be adversely affected 
globalstar s hand held phone is expected to be larger and heavier for the same talk time than today s smaller and lighter pocket sized  hand held cellular telephones and is expected to have a significantly longer and thicker antenna than hand held cellular telephones 
the globalstar system will function best when there is an unobstructed line of sight between the user and one or more of the globalstar satellites 
obstacles such as buildings  trees or mountainous terrain may degrade service quality  more so than would be the case with terrestrial cellular systems  and service may not be available in the core of high rise buildings 
there is no assurance that these characteristics of the hand held globalstar phone will not adversely affect subscriber demand for globalstar service 
there has been adverse publicity concerning alleged health risks associated with the use of portable hand held telephones with transmitting antennas integrated into handsets 
on august   the fcc announced new guidelines for evaluating environmental radio frequency radiation from fcc regulated transmitters based primarily on the exposure criteria recommended in by the national council on radiation protection measurements ncrp 
guidelines applicable to certain portable transmitting devices are based on the ncrp criteria and the exposure criteria developed by the institute of electrical and electronic engineers and recommended in by the american national standards institute 
these guidelines were to become effective as to applications filed after january   the fcc  however  has deferred the effective date 
the handsets globalstar has contracted with qualcomm to develop for use by mobile subscribers will have antennas for communication with the satellites and  in the case of the dual mode and tri mode hand held globalstar phones  with the land based cellular system 
because hand held globalstar phones will use on average lower power to transmit signals than traditional cellular units  globalstar does not believe that the proposed new guidelines will require any significant modifications of the globalstar system or of the mobile hand held globalstar phones designed to be used with the globalstar system 
there can  however  be no assurance that the guidelines  as adopted  or any associated health concerns  would not have an adverse effect on globalstar s mobile handset business 
the success of globalstar s business will be partially dependent upon the ability of globalstar to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
none of the employees of globalstar has an employment contract with globalstar nor does globalstar expect to maintain key man insurance with respect to any such individuals 
the loss of any of these individuals and the subsequent effect on business relationships could have a material adverse effect on globalstar s business 
other factors partners of lqss  the managing general partner of globalstar  or their affiliates are principal suppliers to globalstar of the major components of the globalstar system  and are engaged in the manufacture of system elements to be sold to service providers and subscribers 
during the development and deployment of the globalstar system  globalstar will be substantially dependent upon the management skills of loral and certain technologies developed by loral  qualcomm and ss l to design and manufacture the globalstar satellite constellation  soccs  goccs  gateways and globalstar phones 
globalstar has entered into contracts for the design of various segments of the globalstar system with affiliates of lqss  including a fixed price satellite production contract with ss l and a cost plus fee contract with qualcomm to design the gateways  and globalstar phones 
to the extent that such contracts have been or will be awarded to partners of globalstar or lqss or their affiliates  such parties will have a conflict of interest with respect to the terms thereof 
partners and affiliates of globalstar  including companies affiliated with or controlled by loral  will be among globalstar s principal service provider customers and may therefore have conflicts of interest with respect to the terms of globalstar s service provider agreements and any proposed amendments thereto 
in addition  if globalstar is unable to offer globalstar service to a service provider on competitive terms in a particular country or region  such a service provider  which may be a partner of globalstar  can act as a service provider to a competing mss system in such region or country while at the same time serving as a globalstar service provider in other markets 
year issue globalstar is evaluating the potential effect of the year on its information processing systems 
it is not known at this time what modifications  if any  will be required 
all costs associated with any modification will be expensed as incurred
