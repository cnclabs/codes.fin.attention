item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except where the context indicates otherwise  the information contained in this item is based on the company s business  operations and financial condition as of and for the year ended december  note that all numbers presented are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
background the company is principally engaged in the business of monitoring and servicing security systems 
on november   pursuant to a contribution agreement dated july   between protection one and western resources as amended  the contribution agreement  protection one acquired all of the outstanding stock of westsec and westar which represented the security alarm monitoring business of western resources such business the western resources security business or wrsb  and certain cash and securities 
under the terms of the contribution agreement  western resources was issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock of protection one  which represented approximately of the shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance 
accordingly  although protection one is the legal parent of wrsb  the transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of wrsb and a purchase by wrsb of protection one a reverse acquisition in which wrsb is considered the acquiror for accounting purposes 
the company recorded approximately million of goodwill related to this transaction 
the financial statements of the company for the periods prior to november   are those of wrsb and its predecessor entity  westinghouse security systems wss 
the assets and liabilities of protection one are recorded at their estimated fair values and the accounts of protection one are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
on december   westsec purchased  subscribers and assets  and assumed certain liabilities and obligations  of wss from westinghouse electric corporation wec for million in cash  subject to adjustments 
wrsb initially recorded approximately million of goodwill as a result of this transaction 
westar  formed in  acquired six security businesses and or portfolios of subscriber accounts from november  through september in aggregate  such acquisitions represented approximately  subscribers  and a purchase price of million paid in cash and western resources stock 
goodwill recorded by wrsb related to these acquisitions totaled approximately million 
overview a majority of the company s revenues are derived from recurring payments for the monitoring and servicing of security systems and additional security services  pursuant to contracts with an initial noncancellable term 
service revenues are derived from payments under extended service contracts and for service calls performed on a time and materials basis 
the remainder of the company s revenues are derived primarily from revenues from the sale and installation by company personnel of security systems  add ons and upgrades 
payment for monitoring services is typically required in advance 
monitoring and service revenues are recognized as the service is provided 
installation  add on and upgrade revenue is recognized in the period of installation 
alarm monitoring services generate a significantly higher gross margin than do the other services provided by the company 
in fact  the cost of providing patrol and alarm response services exceeds revenues generated by such services  and although sales and installation services contribute to the company s gross profits  the total expenses associated with alarm system installations also exceed the revenues generated by such services 
the company s strategy  however  is to provide patrol and alarm response services and to invest in system sales and installation because the company believes that such services and products contribute to the generation and retention of alarm monitoring subscribers 
the company expects that system sales and installation activity will decline in  as a result of converting substantially all of wrsb s internal sale force to participants in the dealer program 
accounting differences for new installations and account purchases 
in the past  protection one  which sold systems outright  and wrsb  which has primarily leased systems  have accounted for expenses associated with alarm system installations differently 
protection one s direct installation costs  which include materials  labor and installation overhead  and related selling and marketing costs were expensed in the period incurred 
wrsb s direct installation costs were capitalized while selling and marketing costs and indirect overhead were expensed in the period incurred 
such capitalized costs were amortized over the average estimated subscriber life of ten years 
subsequent to november   protection one has adopted wrsb s policy with respect to installation 
due to the company s strategy to rely primarily on the dealer program and acquisitions to meet its growth objectives  the company anticipates a substantial reduction in installation activities in a difference between accounting treatment of the purchase of subscriber accounts and the accounting treatment of the generation of subscriber accounts through direct sales by the company s sales force impacts the company s results of operations 
all direct external costs associated with purchases of subscriber accounts either through the dealer program or through acquisitions of subscriber account portfolios are capitalized and amortized over ten years on a straight line basis 
company personnel and related support and duplicate costs incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions are expensed as incurred 
other acquisition transition costs that reflect the company s estimate of costs associated with incorporating the purchased subscriber accounts into its operations  including costs incurred by the company in fulfilling the seller s pre acquisition warranty repair service and other obligations to the acquired subscribers are also capitalized and amortized over a ten year period as described above 
direct costs related to alarm system installations are capitalized and amortized over a ten year period 
indirect costs related to alarm system installations are expensed in the period incurred 
subscriber attrition 
subscriber attrition has a direct impact on the company s results of operations  since it affects both the company s revenues and its amortization of intangibles expense 
attrition can be measured in terms of canceled subscriber accounts and in terms of decreased mrr resulting from canceled subscriber accounts 
gross subscriber attrition is defined by the company for a particular period as a quotient  the numerator of which is equal to the number of subscribers who disconnect service during such period and the denominator of which is the average of the number of subscribers at each month end during such period 
net mrr attrition is defined by the company for a particular period as a quotient  the numerator of which is an amount equal to gross mrr lost as the result of canceled subscriber accounts or services during such period  net of i mrr generated during such period by the sale of additional services and increases in rates to existing subscribers  ii mrr generated during such period from the connection of subscribers who move into premises previously occupied by subscribers and in which existing systems are installed and from conversion of accounts that were previously monitored by other companies to the company s monitoring service ie  reconnects and conversions  and iii mrr attributable to canceled accounts that  by virtue of a purchase holdback  are put back to the seller of such accounts during such period ie  guaranteed accounts  and the denominator of which is the average month end mrr in effect during such period 
while the company reduces the gross mrr lost during a period by the amount of guaranteed accounts provided for in purchase agreements with sellers  in some cases the company may not collect all or any of the reimbursement due it from the seller 
during  the company experienced gross subscriber attrition of and net mrr attrition of 
as the company has no economic investment in wholesale accounts  these accounts are excluded from the calculation 
management has established target ranges for gross subscriber attrition and net mrr attrition of and  respectively 
fluctuations in gross subscriber attrition reflect changes in levels of acquisition activity  the rate at which subscribers move  the number of subscribers that the company disconnects for non payment and customer satisfaction with protection one s customer service and field repair functions 
changes in net mrr attrition are caused by the factors impacting gross subscriber attrition  as well as by changes in protection one s ability to generate reconnects and conversions  to create mrr through the sale of additional services and price increases and to obtain purchase holdbacks covering the loss of acquired subscribers 
because the company determines payments to sellers under purchase price holdbacks subsequent to the periods to which such holdbacks apply  and because holdbacks are not allocated to specific guaranteed accounts or specific fiscal periods  the company reduces gross mrr lost during a period by the amount of guaranteed accounts provided for in purchase agreements with sellers 
however  in some cases  the company has not retained the full amount of such holdback to which the company is contractually entitled 
if guaranteed accounts for which the company was not compensated by the seller were taken into account in calculating net mrr attrition  net mrr attrition would have been higher in each period presented above 
mrr represents the monthly recurring revenue protection one is entitled to receive under subscriber contracts in effect at the end of the period 
included in mrr and the number of subscribers are amounts associated with subscribers with past due balances 
it is the policy and practice of protection one that every effort be made to preserve the revenue stream associated with these contractual obligations 
to this end  protection one actively works to both collect amounts owed and to retain the subscriber 
in certain instances  this collection and evaluation period may exceed six months in length 
when  in the judgment of protection one s collection personnel  all reasonable efforts have been made to collect balances due  subscribers are disconnected from protection one s service centers and are included in the calculation of gross subscriber and net mrr attrition 
generally  net mrr attrition is less than actual net account attrition  which the company defines as canceled subscriber accounts net of reconnects  conversions and guaranteed accounts 
estimated net account attrition is the basis upon which the company determines the period over which it amortizes its investment in subscriber accounts 
the company amortizes such investment over ten years based on current estimates 
if actual subscriber account attrition were to exceed such estimated attrition  the company could be required to amortize its investment in subscriber accounts over a shorter period  thus increasing amortization expense in the period in which such adjustment is made and future periods 
since the majority of the subscriber accounts acquired by the company since its formation were purchased recently  there can be no assurance that the actual attrition rates for such accounts will not be greater than the rate assumed by the company

the company intends to use cash flow provided by operations  cash on hand  funding by western resources  and capital raised in debt and equity offerings  as needed  to fund its ongoing operations and growth activities 
the company believes that cash required to fund its growth activities will continue to exceed cash flow provided by operations for the foreseeable future 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  on february   protection one announced its decision to exercise its option to purchase network multi family security corporation network  the leading provider of security alarm monitoring to multi family dwellings with approximately  subscribers 
pursuant to the terms of the option  protection one will give western resources cash consideration of approximately million
