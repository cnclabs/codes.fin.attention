item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview from its inception in to august  the company s only source of revenues was its decorative energy efficient lighting fixture design  manufacturing and installation business

additionally  historical comparisons are not considered meaningful because revenue recognition methodologies vary across the company s businesses 
the company recognizes all revenues associated with a renovation project on a percentage of completion basis  as if the company were a general contractor 
as part of this process  the company develops a complete scope of work to be performed and invoices its clients on a monthly or bi monthly basis as work is performed 
the company s cost of renovation services has been relatively stable over the past two years 
in contrast to the company s recognition of renovation revenues  the company recognizes procurement revenues in three ways i when the company is a principal  during which it functions as a purchaser and reseller of products  the company recognizes all revenues associated with the products it purchases at the time of shipment of the respective product  ii when the company acts as an agent only  service fee income is recognized as revenue at the time the service is provided  and iii when the company provides these services under long term contracts  earnings are recognized under the percentage of completion method  based on efforts expended over the life of the contract 
in each case  the company charges its clients a procurement fee based upon the amount of time and effort it expects to spend on a project 
the company intends to continue to expand its role as a purchaser and reseller because the company believes that it can enter into more advantageous arrangements with its vendors when acting as principal rather than agent 
under each method of procurement revenue recognition  profits primarily include only procurement service fees 
the company realizes reorder revenue based on the fees it charges its clients for services rendered
