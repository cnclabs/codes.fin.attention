year the year issue results from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to identify an applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year based on recent assessments of its computer systems and programs  the company believes that its core manufacturing system software is fully year compliant 
lesser internal applications may require minor modifications or replacement to attain full year compliance and the company intends to make certain investments in its software systems and applications to ensure the company is year compliant

the company s growth depends in part on the development and market acceptance of new products  including next generation ans products 
there is no assurance that the company will continue to develop successful products  that delays in product introduction will not be experienced  or that once such products are introduced  the market will accept them 
government regulation 
the company s business is subject to extensive government regulation  principally by the fda 
the regulatory process  especially as it relates to product approvals  can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
single sourced components 
the company relies on a single supplier for the computer chip used in two components of its scs systems 
the supplier of this computer chip has indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the computer chip in the future  but to date  has not determined when this will occur 
the supplier has agreed to notify the company once a date has been determined and allow the company to place a final one time purchase order for the computer chip 
in the interim  the company is maintaining a higher than normal inventory of the computer chip 
in addition  the company is developing a custom computer chip under its development agreement with hi tronics design  inc to replace the existing computer chip and expects such chip to be available during the latter half of a sudden disruption in supply from the computer chip supplier or another single source supplier could adversely affect the company s ability to deliver finished products on time 
competition and technological change 
the medical device market is highly competitive 
the company competes with many larger companies that have access to greater capital  research and development  marketing  distribution and other resources than the company 
in addition  this market is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid product development and technological change  which could render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
intellectual property rights 
the company relies in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
it may be necessary to defend these rights or to defend against claims that the company is infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
cost pressures on medical technology 
the overall escalating cost of medical products and healthcare results in significant cost pressure 
third party payers are under intense pressure to challenge the prices charged for medical products and services 
the company relies heavily on medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
any amendments to existing reimbursement rules and regulations which restrict or terminate the reimbursement eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of medical procedures using the company s products or the eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of the company s products could have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential product liability 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical devices entail substantial risks of liability claims or product recalls 
reliance on customer distributor 
during  ans had one major customer that accounted for percent or more of its net revenue 
sun medical  inc  a specialty distributor of ans products  accounted for million  or percent  of ans s net revenue for the year ended december  while the company believes its relations with sun medical are good  the loss of this or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other uncertainties 
other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties are discussed in this form k in specific contexts and in the company s other periodic sec filings 
the company is  of course  also subject to general economic risks  the risk of interruption in the source of supply  dependence on key personnel and other risks and uncertainties 
currency fluctuations substantially all of the company s international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for the ans products by increasing the price of the ans products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although management does not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date
