general the company designs  manufactures and markets a broad variety of toys and plastic decorative holiday products 
the company has been involved in the toy industry for approximately years  and in the s diversified into non toy operations such as food products 
the company s business focus shifted entirely to toys and holiday products in when substantial non toy operations were sold 
since mid  the company has undergone changes in management and effected two significant acquisitions which added established core toy product lines to the company 
the company concentrates its sales and manufacturing efforts on items primarily molded from plastic resins 
the major product categories include ride ons  outdoor activities and holiday products which are primarily manufactured domestically  and girls and boys toys  which are sourced through empire s hong kong office 
in october  the company acquired marchon  inc marchon  a toy designer  marketer and manufacturer 
marchon s core toy products included grand champions r collectible horses and crocodile mile r water slides 
marchon had substantial experience at sourcing toy products in the far east 
in july  the company acquired substantially all of the toy product lines of buddy l inc and its hong kong subsidiary collectively  buddy l  one of the oldest toy brands in the united states 
buddy l s core toy products included plastic toy cars  trucks and other vehicles bearing the buddy l r name 
the company s operating results were negatively impacted by serious difficulties encountered at its tarboro  nc plant 
increased seasonal demand in the face of transfers of production from former buddy l facilities  delays in the startup of new or transferred production equipment  increased cost of outsourced production  difficulties created by the influx of buddy l product and the training of new employees all led to the loss of production efficiency  product damage  and missed shipping deadlines which contributed to the company s nonrecurring charges and net loss 
management s task for was well defined to put the tarboro facility on a sound manufacturing base in order to regain the confidence of empire s customers and reduce losses on domestic product 
a new plant organization  including a new plant manager  has implemented cost cutting and control measures which have significantly reduced factory operating costs  more than commensurate with reductions in volume  from levels 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales and net loss 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss for includes a million loss related to the i impairment of long lived assets associated with discontinued product lines of million and ii a million loss on the sale of the steel walled pool business 
the net loss for the year ended december  included a decrease in profit margins resulting from difficulties encountered in the integration of buddy l  million of nonrecurring inventory charges  million of restructuring and other charges  a million increase in interest expense  and higher than normal reserves established for inventory obsolescence and other items 
net sales for decreased by approximately million from  primarily due to lack of customer confidence in empire s ability to fulfill orders because of production and delivery problems during  as well as the company s financial situation in the early part of the year 
customers dramatically reduced the number of items taken as well as quantities ordered per item 
as a result  the sales for the domestically produced products declined dramatically 
in addition  the company decided to reduce the production of battery operated vehicles during due to significant production problems during battery operated vehicles sales declined by million during in addition  sales of big wheelie r products decreased by million 
the company s sales in the holiday products category dropped almost million 
stiff competition and lack of customer confidence in empire s ability to fulfill orders based on the poor performance in are considered the main reasons for this decrease 
the consistency of sales in the girls and boys toys category  which are mostly manufactured in the far east  showed the relative strength of the grand champions r and buddy l r vehicle lines  supported by the newly introduced real bugs tm and record n play tm toys 
during  the company received a million settlement upon termination of an international sales distribution agreement 
gross profit margins 
gross profit margins  excluding the sales distribution settlement and the nonrecurring charges  were slightly higher for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to production improvements at the company s tarboro  north carolina manufacturing facility and the increased percentage of sales of higher margin products manufactured overseas 
the effect of these improvements were adversely impacted by the lower than planned sales volume 
selling and administrative s a 
selling and administrative expenses were reduced significantly during the year ended december  as compared to the previous year primarily due to the decreases in the following executive  marketing and administrative staff approximately million  the outsourcing of warehouse management and shipping functions million and new product development and customer support million 
total selling and administrative expenses were of sales for as compared to in the prior year 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense was lower due to the infusion of cash into the company in june and october from the preferred stock investments  the conversion of the senior subordinated debentures to equity and lower loan balances due to lower accounts receivable and inventory levels 
interest expense during was increased by the write off of million in deferred financing charges resulting from amending the company s lending facilities in december income taxes 
for  the company did not recognize any tax benefits related to the loss 
for  income tax benefits of million were recognized as a result of the ability of the company to carry net operating losses back to prior years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the results of operations for reflect the impact of the buddy l acquisition for the full year ended december  which acquisition occurred on july  net sales and net income loss 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  unaudited pro forma net sales assuming buddy l had been acquired on january  for the full year would have been million 
of the decrease in sales  million was due to the decrease in holiday product sales 
additionally  less than and approximately of the company s sales for the years ended december  and  respectively  were from products licensed under the power rangers r license 
the company de emphasized production of these products in based on its belief that the popularity level of these toys was not sustainable 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decrease in profit margins resulting from difficulties encountered in the integration of buddy l  million of nonrecurring inventory charges  million of restructuring and other charges  a million increase in interest expense  and higher than normal reserves established for inventory obsolescence and other items 
toy sales decreased to million for from million for the decrease was due to missed shipments and order cancellations during the third and fourth quarters  as a result of the production problems encountered at the company s tarboro facility  and the phase out of power rangers r and road racing r products which had contributed million in sales during  and a generally poor retail season 
these reductions were largely offset by the sale of new products such as big wheelie r and fantasy fillies r  a full year of sales of buddy l toys  and increases in the sale of crocodile mile r water slides and grand champions r horses 
the company s sales of holiday products decreased from to by million or approximately due to decreased sales volume in its christmas category 
this decrease resulted from order cancellations related to the production problems encountered at the tarboro plant 
gross profit margins 
gross profit margins were lower for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the difficulties encountered in the third and fourth quarter associated with the manufacture of buddy l products  including the influx of transferred product and machines which resulted in unfavorable production cost variances at the company s tarboro  north carolina manufacturing facility 
selling and administrative s a 
selling and administrative expenses were higher for the year ended december  as compared to the previous year 
contributing to this increase were a million increase in shipping and premium freight charges caused by late and partial shipments from the tarboro  nc plant during the third and fourth quarters  incremental costs of approximately million for staffing of four strategic business units sbu s  duplicate facilities cost of million  and million impairment of long lived assets 
total selling and administrative expenses were of sales for as compared to in the prior year 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense was higher by approximately million due to higher balances of the company s revolving credit lines resulting from the losses incurred  higher inventory and accounts receivable levels  and the write off of million in deferred financing charges resulting from amending the company s lending facilities in december  income taxes 
for  income tax benefits are lower than the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes by million 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality of sales sales of many products are seasonal in nature 
purchase orders for the christmas selling season are typically secured in the months of april  may and june so that by the end of june  the company has historically received orders or order indications for a substantial majority of its full year s toy business 
the company also offers products sold primarily in the spring and summer months including water works tm pools  crocodile mile r water slides and other items  which are shipped principally in the first and second quarters of the year and counter some of this seasonality 
in addition  big wheel r ride ons  grand champions r horses and buddy l r vehicles ship year round 
sales of holiday products are heavily concentrated in the christmas and halloween shopping seasons with substantially all shipments occurring the third and fourth quarters of the year 
the company s production generally is heaviest in the period from june through september 
typically over of toy product revenues are generated in the second half of the year with september and october being the largest shipping months 
this was not the case in  however  due to the overall decline in sales 
as a result of the seasonality  a disproportionate amount of receivables are collected and trade credits are negotiated in the first calendar quarter of the following year 
the company expects that its quarterly operating results will vary significantly throughout the year 
liquidity and capital resources management responded to the circumstances which gave rise to the loss for fiscal by  among other things  restructuring its operations  consolidating its business units  reducing staffing levels  lowering capital expenditures and rationalizing its product lines 
in addition  a new plant organization  including a new plant manager was put in place 
although these efforts resulted in reduced cash outflows  the company  prior to the preferred stock transaction described below  had insufficient cash resources to fund its ongoing operations 
in addition  these events necessitated the company s negotiations with certain trade creditors and of certain amendments to its senior loan agreement  which included  among other things  a commitment on the part of the company to obtain at least million of additional equity financing 
during  the company issued a total of  shares of series a preferred stock and  warrants 
the total gross proceeds from the sale of such securities was million 
concurrently with this offering  the company s convertible debentures were exchanged for newly issued shares of series c convertible preferred stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company used all of the  net proceeds of the million preferred stock investment for working capital purposes  including the repayment of some of the existing trade indebtedness and short term bank debt 
during  the company negotiated extended payouts concerning certain obligations with trade creditors 
the company had positive operating cash flows during of  while also reducing accounts payable and other liabilities by  net borrowings under bank lines were reduced by  from the december  level 
these results were accomplished by converting accounts receivable and inventory into cash  as well as the receipt of an income tax refund during of  margins have improved slightly from and manufacturing costs have been reduced 
factory operations have improved significantly since  with a higher percentage of on time deliveries and a lower overhead structure 
the net loss for was  as compared with a net loss of  for the company s borrowing base has been reduced for several reasons the exiting of unprofitable product lines  the elimination of unutilized assets  and the changing of manufacturing processes to reduce work in process inventory levels 
despite the improvements made during  the company continues to operate under tight cash constraints as it endeavors to pay down outstanding liabilities remaining from  as well as operate under the reduced credit availability of its lending arrangements due to the reduction of its borrowing base 
on march   the secured bank facility was amended  creating greater availability to the company 
maximum borrowings under the facility are capped at million 
interest on the loan may increase in certain circumstances  by up to from current levels 
monthly principal payments on the long term portion of the bank facility have been reduced to  from  covenants will be structured based on the company s projected operating results 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the factors discussed above  among others  may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  and ultimately to attain profitable operations 
it is anticipated that the tarboro plant will be further reorganized to increase operational efficiency  reduce costs and improve gross margins 
rationalization of the business will be an ongoing process  focused on the elimination of products or accounts that are not profitable 
a substantial portion of the company s shipments of its toys produced in the united states are sold with seasonal dating terms 
payments on sales of the company s spring toy product lines produced domestically are generally due june th and payments on sales of its fall product are generally due december th 
goods sourced in the far east are primarily sold under bank letters of credit  with most payments received within days of shipment or shipped to a west coast warehouse and sold with domestic credit terms 
a substantial portion of the company s shipments of holiday products are made on terms that permit payment more than days after shipment of merchandise 
such shipments are generally made after june and require payment by december of the year in which shipment is made 
due to the seasonality of its revenues  the company s working capital requirements fluctuate significantly during the year 
the company s seasonal financing requirements are highest during the fourth quarter and lowest during the first quarter 
marchon toys  a subsidiary of the company located in hong kong  meets its working capital needs through two bank credit facilities which are due on demand 
marchon toys can borrow up to approximately million at interest rates ranging from to over the banks prime rate 
the availability of borrowings is primarily based on marchon toys accounts receivable and inventory balances  as defined 
all of marchon toys assets are collateralized under the loan agreements 
during the first quarter of  the company received its federal income tax refund of million which was applied to general working capital needs 
capital expenditures  principally for the purchase of tooling for new products and equipment  were reduced to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the company is subject to various actions and proceedings  including those relating to intellectual property matters  environmental matters and product liability matters 
see legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year compliance the inability of computers  software and other equipment to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as in the case with most companies using computers  the company is in the process of addressing the year compliance issue 
due to the operational problems experienced by the company  the company did not commit resources to address the year issues until as a result  the company has not quantified the potential cost of year compliance 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test all of its software for year compliance 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with the year issue will depend on a number of factors  including software modification costs  hardware costs  and the availability and cost of consultants 
impact of inflation the primary raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s domestic toys and holiday products are petrochemical derivatives  principally polyethylene 
during the price of polyethylene increased by approximately from the levels at the end of  with the increases primarily occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the company was unable to pass along a significant portion of the price increases during beginning in late  the price of polyethylene declined but still remained above historical levels 
during prices again rose by approximately 
polyethylene prices remained relatively stable during due to the time lag between the purchase of raw materials and the sale of finished goods  results of operations may be only partially affected in the period in which such prices change 
backlog the company had open orders of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
open orders at december  are significantly lower due to the sale of the steel walled pool business in the fourth quarter of orders for water slides are also reduced 
pools and waterslides typically ship in the first and second quarters 
end of year order positions do not yet include orders for fall product lines 
the company believes that because order patterns in the retail industry vary from time to time  open orders on any date in a given year are not a meaningful indication of the future sales
