other items and impact of inflation seasonal business affects the company s operations in that sales are generally greater in the second half of the year note 
in recent years  the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been minimal  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
the company s business is characterized by large purchases and high sales volumes extended across diverse product lines  rapid inventory turns and low profit margins 
in this environment  vendor price changes are typically passed on to the customer 
the company does not believe inflation or deflation has significantly affected its competitive position in the industry 
however  since price changes do cause sales dollars to fluctuate  the use of the lifo method of accounting for inventories reduces the impact of price changes on earnings by matching current costs with current revenues 
during  the company accelerated its task of addressing the year technology application issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations

the company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors and risks including  but not limited to the following hannaford s future operating results are dependent on its ability to achieve increased sales and to control expenses 
factors such as lower than expected inflation  product cost fluctuations particularly in perishable categories  changes in product mix or the use of promotional items  both of which may affect pricing strategy  continued or increased competitive pressures from existing competitors and new entrants  including price cutting strategies  and deterioration in general or regional economic conditions are all factors which could adversely affect sales projections 
other components of operating results could be adversely affected by state or federal legislation or regulation that increases costs  increases in interest rates or the company s cost of borrowing  increases in labor rates due to low unemployment or other factors  unanticipated costs related to the opening and closing of stores or the inability to control various expense categories 
hannaford s future growth is dependent on its ability to expand its retail square footage 
increases in interest rates or the company s cost of capital  the unavailability of funds for capital expenditures and the inability to develop new stores or convert existing stores as rapidly as planned are all risks to the company s projected future expansion 
adverse determinations with respect to pending or future litigation or other material claims against hannaford could affect actual results 
the costs of the year issue and its action plan are management s best estimates  which were derived using assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors
