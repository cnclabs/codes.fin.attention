item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
reference herein to any particular year or quarter generally refers to the company s fiscal year periods 
during the last three years  the company operated primarily in one industry segment through its electronic marketing group  which distributed electronic components and computer products 
the electronic marketing group accounted for almost  and of avnet s consolidated sales in  and  respectively  and it accounted for before special items as discussed below  and of consolidated net income during those respective periods 
therefore  due to the dominance of the electronic marketing group and the immaterial size of the video communications group  this discussion and analysis section will focus primarily on consolidated information 
in october  the company completed the disposition of its channel master business  the sole remaining operation in the video communications group 
as a result of the immaterial size of the video communications group as noted above  the disposition of the channel master business did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition and liquidity  and will not have a material impact on future results of operations 
effective as of the beginning of  the company changed its organizational structure to better focus on its core businesses in order to better meet the needs of both its customers and suppliers 
this change to the company s organizational structure involved dividing the electronic marketing group into its two major lines of businesses the distribution of electronic components and the distribution of computer products 
accordingly  the company currently consists of two major operating groups  the electronics marketing group emg and the computer marketing group cmg 
through the end of  these two units comprised the former electronic marketing group 
emg  which focuses on the global distribution of and value added services associated with electronic components  is comprised of three regional operations emg americas  emg emea europe  middle east and africa and emg asia 
cmg  which focuses on middle to high end  value added computer products distribution  consists of avnet computer  hall mark computer and a number of other speciality businesses 
the business of each of these operations is discussed elsewhere in this report 
see item of this report 
references below under results of operations to emg and cmg are to the new group structure 
results of operations consolidated sales were a record billion in  up as compared with sales of billion in emg s record sales of billion in were up approximately as compared with billion in  and cmg s sales of billion in were up over as compared with billion in channel master s sales in prior to its disposition were million as compared with million in emg americas sales in of billion were up almost as compared with the prior year  while emg emea s sales were up approximately and emg asia s sales were essentially unchanged 
each of the operations within emg americas posted higher sales in as compared with  except for avnet industrial  which was sold as of the end of consolidated sales were billion in  or higher than the billion in this increase was due to increased sales at each of the operations in emg americas and to significantly higher sales at cmg  offset somewhat by lower sales in emg emea 
sales of cmg  emg americas  and emg asia in were up approximately  and  respectively  while sales of emg emea and the video communications group were down and  respectively  as compared with in connection with the change in organizational structure referred to above  the company reorganized its emg americas operation in order to provide more value to its customers and suppliers 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million pre tax and million after tax per share on a diluted basis for the fourth quarter of incremental special charges associated principally with the reorganization 
approximately million of the pre tax charge is included in operating expenses  and million is included in cost of sales 
these charges include severance  real property lease termination costs  inventory reserves required related to supplier terminations  the writedown of goodwill and other items 
the writedown of goodwill relates to a small underperforming operating unit  the ultimate disposition of which will not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations 
of the special charges of million pre tax  approximately million will not require an outflow of cash and million will require the use of cash million of the million had been expended as of the end of 
the balance of cash is expected to be paid by the end of  except for amounts associated with long term real property lease terminations and contractual commitments  the amounts of which are not material 
management expects that the company s future results of operations will benefit from the expected cost savings resulting from the reorganization  and that the impact on liquidity and sources and uses of capital resources will not be material 
although management is planning to reorganize the company s emg emea operations along lines similar to that of emg americas  a final detailed plan had not yet been firmly established at the end of  nor were the plans then at a stage where the aggregate reorganization costs associated therewith could have been accurately quantified 
however  some initial reorganization steps had been taken  and the relevant costs were included in the company s fourth quarter special charges 
it is currently anticipated that the balance of the associated special charges of emg emea will be reflected in the first quarter financial statements 
in addition  there will be additional special costs incurred in the first quarter of relating to the emg americas reorganization 
these costs will include primarily employee relocation and special incentive payments 
in addition to the fourth quarter special charges referred to above  the results include the second quarter gain on the sale of the company s channel master business amounting to million pre tax  offset somewhat in operating expenses by costs relating to the divestiture of avnet industrial  the closure of the company s corporate headquarters in great neck  new york  and the anticipated loss on the sale of company owned real estate  amounting to million in the aggregate 
at the time the special charges were recorded  they represented primarily a non cash writedown to reflect the expected value to be received upon the disposition of avnet industrial and the company owned real estate 
the company has subsequently disposed of avnet industrial for an amount approximating the written down value  and is still in the process of disposing of the company owned real estate  the written down value of which is still believed to approximate its market value  based upon real estate appraisals 
the disposition of avnet industrial and of the company owned real estate will not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations  liquidity and sources and uses of capital resources 
the net effect of these items is to increase income before income taxes by million and net income by million per share on a diluted basis for the second quarter 
in total  the special items recorded in as discussed above negatively impacted income before income taxes  net income and diluted earnings per share by million  million  and per share  respectively 
the effective tax rate related to the special items reflects the impact of certain amounts which are not subject to income taxes 
the impact of the special items on diluted earnings per share for was less than the sum of the applicable amounts for the second quarter and fourth quarter per share less per share due to the effect of the company s stock repurchase program on the weighted average number of shares outstanding see liquidity and capital resources below and the amount of the special items 
in  sales of semiconductors  computer products  connectors and other products principally passives and electromechanical devices  represented   and  respectively  of consolidated sales including channel master s sales which are reflected in other products as compared with   and  respectively  in consolidated gross profit margins before special charges were in as compared with and in and  respectively 
this downward trend is due primarily to the competitive environment in the electronic distribution marketplace as a result of the global industry correction cycle as well as the effect of increased sales of computer products  which have lower gross margins than other products in the company s product line 
although operating expenses before special charges in absolute dollars were sequentially higher during the last three years  they decreased as a percentage of sales over that time span 
the company reduced operating expenses as a percentage of sales to in as compared with and in and  respectively 
as a result  operating income before special charges of million in represented of sales  as compared with million or of sales in and million or of sales in other income was million in as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
other income in included the third quarter million gain on the sale of the company s culver city  california facility 
interest expense was million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the significant increase in interest expense in as compared with the prior two years was due primarily to increased borrowings to fund the company s stock repurchase program and to fund the additional working capital requirements to support the growth in business 
as a result of the factors described above  net income in was million  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared with million  or per share on a diluted basis  in and million  or per share on a diluted basis  in excluding the special items referred to above  net income in was million  or per share on a diluted basis 
net income before special items as a percentage of sales was in as compared with and in and  respectively 
although net income before special items in dollars was down in as compared with  as described above  diluted earnings per share before special items of was down only as compared with in  due to the impact of the company s stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources below 
emg s operating net income  which is defined as income before the allocation of corporate headquarters expenses and interest associated with the stock repurchase program  for was about below the level due primarily to global industry conditions  while cmg s operating net income in was about higher than in the prior year 
as the company has increased its investment in foreign operations  the financial statement impact associated with the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates has become more apparent 
the translation into us dollars of the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in a charge recorded directly to shareholders equity amounting to million  million and a million in  and  respectively 
the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the french  canadian and far east currencies against the us dollar  and the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the french  german  italian and swedish currencies against the us dollar 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the statement of income was not material due to the fact that avnet s international operations represent only of sales and a smaller percentage of income 
had the various average foreign currency exchange rates remained the same during as compared with  avnet s sales and net income would have been approximately higher than the actual reported results for although the foreign currency turmoil in the far east has negatively affected the company s business  the impact has been relatively minor since the company s far east operations accounted for less than of consolidated sales and approximately of consolidated net income 
in addition  management does not believe the current financial situation in russia will have a material effect on the company since it only does an insignificant amount of business in the russian market 
the company may  of course  be negatively impacted should the economic problems surrounding the asian and russian markets expand to north america and throughout europe 
liquidity and capital resources over the last three years  cash generated from income before depreciation  amortization  the pre tax gain on the sale of channel master and other non cash items amounted to million 
during that period  million was used for working capital needs excluding cash resulting in million of net cash flows provided from operations 
in addition  million  net  was needed for other normal business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment million and dividends million  offset by cash generated from other immaterial items million 
this resulted in million being used for normal business operations 
during that three year period  the company also used million  net  for the repurchase of its common stock million  acquisitions net of dispositions million  and the repayment of other debt million 
this overall use of cash of million was financed by million raised from the issuance of commercial paper and an increase in bank debt  offset by a million increase in cash

this resulted in million being used for normal business operations 
the company also used million to repurchase its common stock and generated million from its disposition of channel master  net of cash used for acquisitions  and the issuance of other debt 
this overall use of cash of million was financed by a million increase in bank debt and commercial paper  offset by a million increase in cash 
in  the company generated million from income before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  and used million for working capital needs  resulting in million of net cash flows provided from operations 
in addition  the company used million for other normal operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment million  net of million received in connection with the sale of the company s former culver city  california facility and dividends million  offset by cash generated from other immaterial items million 
this resulted in million being generated from normal business operations 
the company also used million to repurchase its common stock  and million for acquisition related items and the payment of other debt 
this overall net use of cash of million was financed by a million increase in bank debt and commercial paper  offset by an million increase in cash 
the company s quick assets at june  totaled million as compared with million at june  at june   quick assets exceeded the company s current liabilities by million as compared with a million excess at the end of working capital at june  was billion as compared with billion at june  at june  to support each dollar of current liabilities  the company had of quick assets and of other current assets  for a total of as compared with at the end of the prior fiscal year 
in the first quarter of  the company renegotiated its revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by nationsbank of north carolina  na nationsbank 
the amended credit agreement provides a five year facility with a line of credit of up to million  increased from the previous amount of million 
the company may select from various interest rate options and maturities under this facility 
the facility serves as a primary funding vehicle as well as a backup for the company s commercial paper program pursuant to which the company is authorized to issue short term notes for current operational business requirements 
the credit agreement contains various covenants  none of which management believes materially limit the company s financial flexibility to pursue its intended financial strategy 
the company also has an additional credit facility with nationsbank which provides a line of credit up to million 
subsequent to the end of  the company issued million of notes due august  the notes 
the net proceeds received by the company from the sale of the notes were approximately million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses associated with the sale 
the net proceeds from the notes have been used to repay indebtedness which the company may re borrow for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  possible acquisitions  repurchase of the company s common stock and working capital needs 
during  the company completed the million and million stock repurchase programs that were authorized by its board of directors on august  and november   respectively 
during and  the company used approximately million and million  respectively  to repurchase a total of million shares million shares in and million shares in 
at june   the company had million outstanding under its commercial paper program  million outstanding under its bank syndicated revolving credit facility  million of the notes due march   and million of other debt 
this million of total debt at june  represents an increase of million over the million outstanding at june  the company s debt to capital shareholders equity plus total debt ratio was approximately at june  and at june  in  income  before special items referred to above  was about seven times greater than fixed charges 
internally generated cash flow during  represented by net income before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  was million or of total debt at june  during the last three years  the company s capital rose million to a total of billion at june  shareholders equity increased by million to billion million from earnings  net of dividends  reinvested in the business and million as a result of the conversion of the company s convertible subordinated debentures offset by a million reduction as a result of the company s repurchase of its common stock and million  net  for other items 
total debt increased by million over the last three years to million at june  the company s favorable balance sheet ratios would facilitate additional financing if  in the opinion of management  such financing would enhance the future operations of the company 
certain of the company s operations  primarily its international subsidiaries  occasionally purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the market risk related to the foreign exchange contracts is offset by the changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the amount of risk and the use of derivative financial instruments described above is not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
including the recently issued notes  approximately of the company s outstanding debt is in fixed rate instruments and is subject to variable short term interest rates 
accordingly  the company will be impacted by any change in short term interest rates 
the company does not hedge either its investment in its foreign operations or its floating interest rate exposures 
with the year less than two years away  many companies  including avnet  will need to modify their computer systems and applications which currently use two digit fields to designate a year year issue 
the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the company has both engaged several outside consulting firms and is using internal resources to perform a comprehensive remediation of the company s computer systems before the year the costs to modify the existing computer systems and applications are significant  however  they will not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the current estimate including potential capital expenditures is in the range of million to million 
at present  the remediation program is on schedule and is expected to be successfully completed 
although the company cannot control the efforts of the many third parties with which it interfaces  it does not currently anticipate that there will be any significant disruption of the company s ability to transact business 
the company is in contact with all its major suppliers to ascertain their progress in implementing year remediation 
to capitalize on growing world markets for electronic components and computer products  the company has pursued and expects to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand its business 
management believes that the company has the ability to generate sufficient capital resources from internal or external sources in order to continue its expansion program 
in addition  as with past acquisitions  management does not expect that future acquisitions will materially impact the company s liquidity 
currently  the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company and the former owners of a company owned site in oxford  north carolina have entered into a consent decree and court order with the environmental protection agency epa for the environmental clean up of the site  the cost of which  according to the epa s remedial investigation and feasibility study  is estimated to be approximately million  exclusive of the million in epa past costs paid by the potentially responsible parties prp s 
pursuant to a consent decree and court order entered into between the company and the former owners of the site  the former owners have agreed to bear at least of the clean up costs of the site  and the company will be responsible for not more than of those costs 
in addition  the company has received notice from a third party of its intention to seek indemnification for costs it may incur in connection with an environmental clean up at a site in rush  pennsylvania resulting from the alleged disposal of wire insulation material at the site by a former unit of the company 
based upon the information known to date  management believes that the company has appropriately accrued in its financial statements for its share of the costs of the clean ups at all the above mentioned sites 
the company is also a prp  or has been notified of claims made against it  at an environmental clean up site in huguenot  new york 
at this time  management cannot estimate the amount of the company s potential liability  if any  for clean up costs in connection with this site  but does not anticipate that this matter or any other contingent matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
management is not now aware of any commitments  contingencies or events within the company s control which may significantly change its ability to generate sufficient cash from internal or external sources to meet its needs
