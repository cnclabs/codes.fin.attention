overview in september  the company sold its software business  compass design automation  inc compass to avant corporation avant 
the results for compass have been segregated on the consolidated statements of income and accounted for as a discontinued operation  as the software subsidiary represented a separate line of business for the company 
prior period consolidated statements of income and all components of income from the discontinued operation have been reclassified accordingly 
in  the company reported a net revenue increase of and a gross profit increase of from continuing operations as compared to these increases primarily reflect growth in the communications business 
operating profits from continuing operations were of net revenues in as compared to a net operating loss in income from continuing operations in was million on net revenues of million compared to loss from continuing operations of million on net revenues of million in and income from continuing operations of million on net revenues of million in in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded special charges of million  primarily relating to the closure of its san jose  california fabrication facility 
in october  production ceased at the facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the company derives its net revenues primarily from sales of integrated circuits ics for particular markets 
thousands net revenues    percentage increase decrease over preceding year less than net revenues for increased as compared to the increase over primarily reflects a significant increase in unit volume for the company s communications products  as units shipped in more than doubled from the levels 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in shipments to the company s personal computing customers 
net revenues in of the company s products for personal computers pc were less than of total net revenues 
during the first quarter of  shipments for the company s products have slowed primarily in wireless communications and consumer digital entertainment due to the seasonality of these consumer oriented markets  the business uncertainties associated with the current economic situation in the asia pacific region and inventory adjustments underway at a range of customers 
the company expects revenues and earnings for the first quarter to decline from the first quarter of as well as from the fourth quarter of the company s net revenues in were down slightly from levels as strong demand for products designed for communications  consumer digital entertainment and advanced computing devices nearly offset declines in net revenues for products sold to the pc market 
in  net revenues from communications markets grew considerably over  reflecting increased units shipped 
in  net revenues from the communications market increased as units shipped in that market during approximately doubled from net revenues from consumer digital entertainment products grew in and  reflecting continued increases of unit shipments for this market 
this increase in was due to new business in the video arcade arena and an increased demand for set top boxes for satellite and cable tv products 
international net revenues including export sales increased  accounting for of net revenues for compared to approximately of net revenues for and approximately for the increase was primarily due to increases in sales to europe 
the growth in european net revenues reflects increased sales to the company s major customers for communications devices and the success of gsm in becoming the leading digital wireless standard in europe 
export sales to the asia pacific area decreased in compared to  due to reduced shipments of devices for the pc market 
thousands gross profit    percentage of net revenues gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in as compared to in both and the increase reflects improved manufacturing performance  including increased capacity utilization and changes in product mix 
gross profit margin for was negatively affected by inventory charges taken for personal computer devices and manufacturing inefficiencies due to capacity under utilization 
improvements made in manufacturing efficiencies and yields that led to lower costs were masked in by costs associated with under utilization of wafer fabrication capacity 
see the discussion of special charges below 
the gross profit margin was adversely affected by manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the conversion of the san jose  california facility to a six inch cmos wafer process and the transition of the san antonio  texas facility to micron and smaller geometry processes 
for further discussion of factors affecting gross profit margins  see factors affecting future results below 
thousands operating expenses excluding special charges    percentage of net revenues excluding special charges operating expenses for continuing operations grew at approximately the same rate as revenues in and were approximately of net revenues in and operating expenses were of net revenues in the increase in operating expenses reflects increasing r d investment and a slower growth of marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the increase from to reflects the lack of revenue growth during a period of increasing r d investment for new products and increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses 
increased r d expenses in each of the last three years reflect the company s continuing investment in new products and package and process technologies 
r d expenditures over the last three years have focused on development of products for the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets and process development 
as a result of the sale of compass  the company has re evaluated its electronic design automation eda resources and expects to increase its licensing of eda tools from several vendors 
while the reclassified consolidated financial statements reflect the annual payments in continuing operations to compass for licensing its products  the company expects to increase its spending for eda tools over the next several years 
marketing  general and administrative expenses have increased in amount each year from to  however  these expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues in and these expenses grew faster than net revenues in as a result of the transition from pc to consumer markets 
the company continues to refocus these functions to better support the markets it serves 
special charges the company recorded total special charges of million in primarily reflecting the company s decision in the fourth quarter to close its san jose  california wafer fabrication facility 
the special charges also included costs associated with a change in estimate for settling lease terminations previously accrued in the company s special charge and adjustments of the net book value of excess assets acquired to expand the san antonio wafer fabrication facility 
also included in special charges was million related to compass 
the reserve for special charges was used primarily in for writing down assets associated with the san jose fabrication facility  while in it was used primarily for cash outflows for employee severance costs and losses associated with sales commitments and customer accommodations as the company ceased production at the san jose facility in october the company continues to have reserves for estimated losses on sales commitments and customer accommodations  which are expected to occur in and charges against the reserve for special charges in and subsequent years were and are expected to be primarily made from currently available cash  cash equivalents  liquid investments and cash flows from operations 
the company has determined its original estimates for the special charges continue to be reasonable 
however  actual costs may differ materially 
in particular  the costs associated with estimating losses on sales commitments and customer accommodations are difficult to ascertain 
therefore  the company may  in future periods  need to change its estimated costs associated with the special charges as more information becomes available 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impact of changes in values of foreign currencies impact of inflation net revenues and cost of sales of foreign subsidiaries are primarily us dollar based 
operating expenditures of foreign subsidiaries are based in local currency 
as a result  fluctuations in currency rates have historically affected operating expenses 
although the us dollar has fluctuated against the japanese yen and major european currencies in the last three years  the company has been able to maintain an approximately offsetting balance between local currency based net revenues and operating expenses 
in periods where there may be a negative impact on operating expenses  the company generally has offsetting favorable currency related results on net revenues 
conversely  when net revenues are negatively impacted  there are generally offsetting favorable impacts on operating expense 
these offsetting tendencies resulted in currency fluctuations having an immaterial net effect on the operations of the company over the last three years 
the company anticipates the difference between foreign currency net revenues and foreign currency operating expenses could become material in  particularly with respect to the japanese yen and possibly certain european currencies 
the company has a program of entering into foreign currency hedges in an attempt to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such hedging activity will be successful in eliminating the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on results of operations 
the company believes that its consolidated financial statements accurately reflect the impact that inflation has  if any  on the results of operations of the company and considers such impact to be immaterial for all periods presented 
patent matters during the third quarter of  the company concluded a patent licensing agreement with ibm and recorded a charge against earnings of million for the release of alleged infringement claims incurred prior to the company recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of associated with claims on patent matters by ti 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense and other  net interest expense increased in  as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures and therefore lower capitalized interest 
interest expense in was higher than reflecting a full year of interest expense associated with the company s convertible subordinated notes the notes issued in september during periods of significant capital expansion  total interest expense is reduced through higher levels of interest capitalization  see liquidity and capital resources below 
interest income  net increased in from reflecting lower interest rates on higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments 
interest income  net decreased in from as cash was used to fund expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities 
the cash had been generated in from the june public offering of common stock and september offering of the notes 
the company incurred immaterial foreign exchange gains and losses in  and provision for taxes on income the tax provision of of income from continuing operations before taxes pre tax income reflects more pre tax income flowing through lower tax jurisdictions and the utilization of certain tax credits 
the company s tax benefit of of pre tax loss reflects us federal and state tax benefits of the company s loss and the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards offset by other individually immaterial items 
the tax provision of of pre tax income reflects the impact of foreign income taxes in excess of us rates offset by state tax benefits and changes in the tax valuation reserve 
the company estimates that its overall effective tax rate will approximate in  however  the and future tax rates may vary depending on the company s overall operating results  the mix of income among tax jurisdictions and the company s ability to use the tax carryforward benefits 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient us taxable income in the future 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
sale of subsidiary in september  the company sold its software business  compass  to avant 
the company received approximately million in cash  inclusive of settlement of intercompany debt between compass and vlsi  and  shares of avant common stock in connection with the sale of compass 
additionally  million in cash and  shares of avant common stock were deposited into a one year escrow account to indemnify avant for contingencies and other matters 
vlsi also agreed to a three year purchase commitment totaling million for software and eda tools 
as a result  the company recognized an after tax gain of approximately million in the third quarter of  net of the after tax loss from compass for the quarter of million 
under the terms of the agreement  avant has registered the restricted stock issued to vlsi for resale into the public market  but the company remains at risk for market price fluctuations until the company actually disposes of the stock in either a public or private sale 
at december   the market value of avant common stock was significantly lower than the value used to compute the million after tax gain on the sale of compass 
as of december   the company had not determined when it might sell the avant common stock and concluded this to be a temporary decline in value 
the reduction in market value of these securities identified as available for sale has been reflected as a reduction in stockholders equity  net of tax 
there can be no assurance the market value of the avant common stock will recover to the value used to compute the gain on sale of compass 
if the company sells the avant common stock prior to the stock recovering its value  vlsi will realize a loss on sale as a part of future operations 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share fas during this pronouncement changed the method used to compute net income per share and all prior period net income per share figures have been restated 
the new requirements include a calculation of basic income per share from which the dilutive effect of stock options  warrants and convertible securities have been excluded 
diluted income per share for vlsi is very similar to the previously reported income per share 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued technical bulletin no 
 accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option fastb 
fastb is effective for stock based awards granted on or after january  the provisions of fastb may affect future year s pro forma disclosures for stock based compensation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other recent literature affecting the company s financial statements includes emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board eitf conclusions on accounting for the costs associated with addressing the year issue see factors affecting future results below and reengineering costs incurred during substantial changes to computerized information systems 
eitf issue  accounting for the costs associated with modifying computer software for the year and eitf issue  accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology transformation state that costs incurred to modify computer programs for the year and costs associated with reengineering business processes as part of changing software applications shall be expensed as incurred 
the company has conformed its accounting practices to these requirements retroactively 
while the cumulative effect of adoption was not material  the company anticipates costs and expenses in and future years will increase more rapidly than had year and reengineering costs been capitalizable and subsequently amortized 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information fas 
the statements are effective for fas requires comprehensive income to be reported with the same prominence as other financial statements 
comprehensive income will include any unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments 
fas changes the definition and reporting of segments and geographic information 
fas requires disclosure by operating segment of information such as profit and loss  assets and capital expenditures  major customers and types of products from which revenues are derived 
adoption of these statements is expected to have no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors affecting future results the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
during  the company s top customers represented approximately three quarters of the company s net revenues 
during and  the company s top customers represented approximately two thirds of net revenues 
the company s largest customer in  ericsson  accounted for approximately of net revenues 
as a result of the concentration of the company s customer base  loss of business or cancellation of orders from any of these customers  significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers or decreases in the prices of products sold to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has shifted its business away from the previously high concentration of sales to the personal computer industry to a concentration of sales to the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets 
the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets are rapidly evolving and are characterized by intense competition among suppliers of integrated circuits  many of whom have substantially greater experience and resources than the company 
if the company  due to competition or other factors  is unable to capture and maintain significant market share in these areas  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
since the company s transition to the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets  the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  with stronger growth in the second half of the year  reflecting the buying pattern of the company s customers 
the company currently generates approximately of its net revenues from direct sales into asia  plus another approximately of its net revenues from direct sales in japan 
however  certain of the company s significant customers generate greater portions of their sales from asia and japan 
if recent events in asian and japanese markets have a significant impact on the company s customers that result in declining orders  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s success depends on its ability to continue to develop and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and that satisfy customer requirements 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of markets  market trends  development and implementation of new processes and technologies and substantial capital commitments 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change 
decreases in geometries call for sophisticated design efforts  advanced manufacturing equipment and cleaner fabrication environments 
if the company is unable to design  develop  manufacture and market new products successfully in a timely manner  its operating results will be materially adversely affected 
no assurance can be given that the company s product and process development efforts will be successful  that new product introductions will achieve market acceptance or that the markets in question will develop 
the company s products are susceptible to severe pricing pressures and the company continually attempts to pursue cost reductions  including process enhancements  in order to maintain acceptable gross profit margins 
gross profit margins also vary reflecting the impact of changes in the general condition of the economy  capacity utilization levels in the semiconductor industry  customer acceptance of new technologies and products  product functionality and capabilities  shifts in product mix  manufacturing yields and the effect of ongoing manufacturing cost reduction activities 
the company sells its products under terms and conditions customarily found in the semiconductor industry 
sales of these products are subject to customer cancellation with limited advance notice to the company prior to scheduled shipment 
due to the company s relatively narrow customer base for certain devices and the short product life cycles of such products  such cancellations can leave the company with significant inventory exposure  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the semiconductor industry has a history of cyclicality and is characterized by short product life cycles  continuous evolution of process technology  high fixed costs  additions of manufacturing capacity in large increments and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
these product supply and demand fluctuations have historically been characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the previously mentioned additions of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
the industry has moved from a period of capacity shortages in to what appears to be a current period of excess capacity for the immediate future 
during a period of industry overcapacity  profitability can drop sharply as factory utilization declines and high fixed costs of operating a wafer fabrication facility are spread over a lower net revenue base 
despite industry overcapacity  there can be no assurance that the company can achieve timely  cost effective access to such capacity when needed 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps and requiring production in a highly controlled  clean environment 
minute impurities  errors in any step of the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be non functional 
semiconductor manufacturing also requires a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive 
the company has decided to convert its san antonio facility from six inch to eight inch wafer capability in late any significant expansion or upgrade of semiconductor manufacturing capacity has attendant risks 
inefficiencies caused by the work associated with the modifications of the manufacturing facilities could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
this risk is increased as the company has shifted an even greater percentage of its manufacturing to its own facilities in and  vlsi produced more than of its wafer requirements internally versus approximately in 
the company relies on outside suppliers for a significant portion of its assembly and test operations 
allocations by these suppliers of assembly and test capacity to the company depend on the company s needs  supply availability during periods of capacity shortages and excesses and pricing 
the company has no long term contractual commitments from these suppliers 
any reduction in allocation from these suppliers could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s foreign subcontract manufacturing arrangements are subject to risks such as changes in government policies  transportation delays  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and export and tax controls 
while the company has not experienced any supply issues as a result of recent economic events in asia  there can be no assurances that changes in the asian economy will not affect its asia based suppliers thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at either the company s production facilities or those of its subcontractors for any reason  such as fire  could cause significant delays in shipments until the company could shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility 
the company s san jose facility  which includes a primary shipping location and its computer center  is located near major earthquake faults 
should an earthquake or other natural disaster cause an interruption in operations  operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which have on occasion resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
there are many semiconductor companies substantially larger than vlsi that have product and process technology rights that vlsi may have infringed 
the company continually evaluates the adequacy of its reserve for asserted and unasserted patent matters 
the reserve for patent matters is based on the best available information at that time and it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of the exposure for patent matters could materially change in the near term 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology used by the company in the manufacture of some or all of its products may infringe on product or process technology rights held by others 
resolution of whether the company s manufacture of products has infringed on valid rights held by others could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations and may require material changes in production processes and products 
several companies  including motorola  have individually contacted the company concerning its alleged use of intellectual property belonging to them 
vlsi has entered into licensing agreements and technology exchange agreements with various strategic partners and other third parties in order to allow vlsi access to third party technology or to allow third parties access to the company s technology 
the company is unable to predict whether license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to the company or the magnitude of the costs associated with such terms 
failure to obtain or renew such licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  thus rendering them incapable of properly managing and manipulating data that includes both th and st century dates year compliant 
the company is currently installing various new internal information systems in connection with operating its business 
these systems are believed to be year compliant 
the company is in the process of determining what other changes to its other information systems are necessary in order to make them year compliant 
while the company currently expects that the year will not pose significant internal operational problems  delays in the implementation of new information systems  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is assessing its products to ensure that they are year compliant 
the ongoing assessment has not revealed any significant compliance issues 
however  the inability of these products to properly manage and manipulate data in the year could result in a material adverse impact on the company  including increased warranty costs  customer satisfaction issues and potential lawsuits 
the company has initiated communications with its suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company s capabilities are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems and products of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
while the total cost of the year project has not yet been determined  the current investigation has not identified significant costs to date 
accordingly  the company believes it has sufficient resources for the year project from currently available cash  cash equivalents  liquid investments  cash flow expected from operations and or borrowings under the committed credit agreement 
management believes that the future success of vlsi will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees  including management and technical and design personnel 
in particular  the company currently has numerous open positions  specifically in the engineering arena 
any significant delays in filling these positions will lead to delays in the introduction of various products currently being developed  as well as the research and development associated with potential new products 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations 
the company s san antonio and san jose facilities are located near residential areas  which could increase the incidence of environmental complaints or investigations 
there can be no assurance that changes in environmental regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or adequately to restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject vlsi to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
liquidity and capital resources vlsi generates cash from operations  debt and equipment financings and sales of its securities 
principal uses of cash include purchases of capital equipment needed for semiconductor manufacturing and engineering  the repurchase of common stock and payments of debt and lease obligations 
in  the company received approximately million in cash  inclusive of settlement of intercompany debt between compass and vlsi  and  shares of avant stock in connection with the sale of compass 
thousands cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments    working capital    stockholders equity    at december   total cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments increased million from year end due primarily to net income and proceeds received on the sale of compass 
during  total cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments decreased million from year end due primarily to the ongoing capital expansion of the company s san antonio fabrication facilities and the repurchase of common stock 
during  total cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments increased million from year end due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering late in the second quarter of  proceeds from a convertible debt offering in september  proceeds from the exercise by intel in august of its warrant to purchase vlsi common stock and net income  offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment and payments of debt and capital leases during working capital was million compared to million at december  and million at december  during  the company generated million of cash from operations  a increase over the million of cash generated from operations for and a increase over the million of cash generated from operations for accounts receivable increased million in adjusted for the disposal of compass while having decreased million in and increased million in inventory levels decreased million in as a result of closing the san jose fabrication facility 
inventory decreased million in  reflecting product mix changes from computer to communications and consumer products 
inventory levels in increased million due to a build up of custom products primarily for the communications markets 
accounts payable  income taxes payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in adjusted for the disposal of compass primarily due to cash outlay for employee and severance costs and losses associated with sales commitments and customer accommodations included in the reserve for special charges offset by increases in other accrued liabilities 
accounts payable  income taxes payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in due to less volume with outside wafer suppliers and assembly and test operations 
accounts payable  income taxes payable and accrued liabilities contributed approximately million to cash from operations in  reflecting increased spending levels associated with increases in production volumes and the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options by employees and the exercise by intel of its warrant 
the effect of deferred income taxes on cash generated by operations was unusually high in due to the special charges recorded in the fourth quarter of cash used for investing activities was million for  as compared to million for and million for vlsi invested million in property  plant and equipment during compared to million in and million in capital additions during  and were financed primarily by cash 
the and investments in property  plant and equipment focused on facilitization and equipment for expansion of the san antonio facility 
investments during each of the three years through also included acquisition of equipment for sub micron wafer fabrication  upgrades to manufacturing and office facilities and computers and software to support research and development activity 
as part of the capital purchases  vlsi acquired land and buildings at its san jose headquarters for approximately million 
during  the company sold million of property  plant and equipment in connection with sale leaseback arrangements  which resulted in the related equipment now being subject to operating leases 
this refinancing reduced effective interest rates by approximately 
gains realized on the sale leasebacks are deferred and amortized against future rent expense 
the company realized net cash proceeds of million from the sale of compass during the company s purchases of liquid investments exceeded proceeds from maturities of liquid investments in  while in proceeds on maturities exceeded purchases 
this change reflects reduced capital expenditures in cash used for financing activities was million in compared to million in and cash provided by financing activities of million in during  the company accelerated repayment of certain secured equipment loans in conjunction with the sale leaseback of equipment 
as further described below  the company repurchased shares of the company s common stock in and for a total cost of million and million  respectively 
the source of cash in reflects proceeds from the issuance of the company s securities in  including the company s june equity offering million shares for net proceeds to the company of approximately million  the august exercise by intel of a warrant for million shares for net proceeds of approximately million and a september debt offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due for net proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  the company completed the conversion of its million convertible subordinated debentures into common shares in august in january  the board of directors of the company the board authorized the company to repurchase shares of the company s common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the board authorized the company to re issue those shares at a later date through certain of its employee stock plans and or to fund stock or asset acquisitions authorized by the board 
during  the company repurchased million shares at an average per share price of and re issued million of these shares as part of employee stock option and stock purchase plan activities 
the remaining million shares were re issued during the first half of during  the company repurchased million shares at an average per share price of and re issued million of these shares under employee stock plans 
the company may  from time to time  continue to repurchase additional shares 
thousands capital expenditures    vlsi currently estimates that total budgeted capital expenditures for will be approximately million  primarily including expenditures for converting from six inch to eight inch wafer technology at the san antonio fabrication facility  sub micron wafer fabrication capability  eda tools deployment and other equipment upgrades 
as vlsi pursues large manufacturing capital projects in increasingly complex technologies  more time is needed to bring manufacturing capabilities on line 
accordingly  vlsi will continue to capitalize interest on these capital projects 
of such planned capital expenditures  the level of which could change as necessary during the year  vlsi had outstanding commitments for purchases of equipment and eda licenses of approximately million at december  in october  the company entered into an agreement with wafer technology malaysia sdn bhd  a malaysian company wtm  proposing to build a subcontract wafer fabrication facility in malaysia 
under this agreement  the company would own less than percent of wtm and would be expected to fund its investment starting in in addition  the company would provide certain technology and training and consulting services to wtm 
upon completion of the wtm facility  the company would purchase wafers from wtm and have the right to receive an allocation of the capacity of the wtm facility 
the purchase price for wafers would be a function of the market price 
the companies have agreed in principle to convert and operate the vlsi san jose wafer fabrication facility as a prototype and development facility 
under this arrangement  wtm and vlsi would share the related conversion and future operational costs 
such payments are expected to be made with available cash  cash equivalents  liquid investments  cash flow expected from operations and or borrowings under the committed credit agreement 
the company has a committed credit agreement for million  expiring in december while the company believes that its current capital resources are sufficient to meet its near term needs  in order to meet its longer term needs  vlsi continues to investigate the possibility of generating financial resources through technology or manufacturing partnerships  additional equipment financings and offerings of debt or equity securities
