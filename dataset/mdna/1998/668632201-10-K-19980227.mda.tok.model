significant expenditures which we incurred primarily consisted of the drilling segment s continual acquisition of replacement drilling equipment  such as drill collars  drill pipe  engines and transportation equipment to adequately maintain the operating status of the drilling fleet 
these expenditures were approximately  for the year ended november    for the year ended november  and  for the year ended november  the drilling segment anticipates capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal to be funded from existing bank credit lines and cash flow from operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as a part of item of this report 
due to numerous uncertainties regarding the availability  price and delivery of certain drilling equipment  norton s anticipated level of capital expenditures may fluctuate commensurate with the volatility of the industry 
we believe that cash flows from operations and borrowings should be sufficient to fund continuing operations and adequately service our debt for the next twelve months 
the risks associated with the oil and gas industry  page such as the volatility of oil and gas prices  could adversely affect our operations

direct job and rig costs for were approximately  or of contract drilling revenues as compared to approximately  or of contract drilling revenues in the increase in costs was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of rigs which norton was operating 
direct rig and jobs costs decreased as a percentage of revenues because the rates norton charged for the use of its drilling rigs increased more than its costs associated with those rigs

the decrease in direct job and rig costs as a percentage of contract drilling revenues is due to a reduction in the costs associated with wells drilled on a turnkey basis 
fewer wells were drilled on a turnkey contract basis for large dollar amounts in fiscal this in turn resulted in fewer direct job and rig costs  as wells drilled on page a turnkey basis usually incur large amounts of costs 
as revenues increased  but direct job and rig costs decreased  this led to a reduction in the percentage of direct job and rig costs to contract drilling revenues 
general and administrative expenses for the contract drilling segment were approximately  in as compared to  in general and administrative expenses increased due to the hiring of three additional office personnel and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the approximate amount of  interest expense was approximately  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the current year decrease is attributable to a decrease in the interest rate paid by the drilling segment to its primary creditor

income taxes for the year ended november   we recorded no income tax expense due to the fact that no taxable income was generated in that year 
for the year ended november   no income tax expense was recorded due to the utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards which had been generated in prior years 
at november   we had approximately  of remaining nol carryforwards which could be applied to future tax years 
during the year ended november   all of these remaining nol s were utilized and charges to operations of approximately  for federal income taxes and approximately  for state income taxes were recorded 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as part of item of this report 
volatility of oil and gas prices the drilling segment s revenue and profitability are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and gas 
historically  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments and international cartels 
all of these are beyond the control of the drilling segment 
any significant or extended decline in oil and or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on ndsi s financial condition and results of operations 
impact of inflation while subject to inflation  our business was not impacted by inflation during the past three fiscal years in any material respect 
we do no believe that inflation will have a material impact on our business in the near future 
year many existing computer programs use two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the upcoming change in century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year page we have conducted a comprehensive review of our computer systems to identify the systems which could be affected by the year issue  and are developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
based on our review of our computer systems  we do not believe that the cost of remediation will be material to our financial position and results of operations
