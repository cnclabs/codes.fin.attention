funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of income producing property held for investment  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate  and after adjustments for unconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships and joint ventures  to be the industry standard for reporting the operations of real estate investment trusts reits 
adjustments for investments in real estate partnerships are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
while management believes that ffo is the most relevant and widely used measure of the company s performance  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
additionally  the company s calculation of ffo  as provided below  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo increased by from to as a result of the acquisition activity discussed above under results of operations 
ffo for the periods ended december  and are summarized in the following table net income for common stockholders    add subtract real estate depreciation and amortization  net    gain on sale of office building minority interests in net income of redeemable partnership units  funds from operations    cash flow provided by used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    environmental matters the company like others in the commercial real estate industry  is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and the operation of dry cleaning plants at the company s shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
the company believes that the dry cleaners are operating in accordance with current laws and regulations and has established procedures to monitor their operations 
based on information presently available  no additional environmental accruals were made and management believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known matters will not have a material effect on the financial position  liquidity  or operations of the company 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of the shopping centers  however  substantially all of the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
year system conversions the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year problem and is in process of resolving the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than this could result in major system failure and miscalculations 
during  the company converted its operating system  and its general accounting and lease administration software systems to versions containing modifications that corrected for the year problem 
both suppliers have received itaa certification from the information technology association of america  the industry s century date change certification program 
the company will continue to assess its other internal systems and reprogram or upgrade as necessary 
the company is also reviewing the year system conversions of other companies of which it does business in order to determine their compliance
