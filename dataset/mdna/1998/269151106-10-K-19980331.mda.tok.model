net revenues 
net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net revenues rose by between and primarily from increased sales of the company s video products 
during  the company experienced severe average selling price asp erosion in a highly competitive sales environment in both the audio and video markets 
net revenues for increased from primarily as a result of the increased sales growth of the company s existing pc audio products as well as from the introduction of new pc audio and video semiconductor products 
the company s pc audio products accounted for substantially all of the company s net revenues for and a majority in international revenues accounted for approximately  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
the significant increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenues between and primarily reflects the transfer of production by us based pc customers from us to asia and growth in the sales of video products which are sold in asian markets 
the company expects that its percentage of international sales will remain high in the future 
gross margin 
gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing corresponding gross margins of  and of net revenues for such years 
gross margin declined from to as a result of lower asps on existing products arising from highly competitive market conditions and manufacturing startup costs associated with the company s new pc audio  video and modem products 
these lower asps on existing products were partially offset by a reduction in product costs and higher asps associated with the new pc audio and video products 
the decrease in gross margins from to were a result of lower asps on the company s products throughout the year and an inventory charge to cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of million for inventory reserves 
the charge was for excess inventory positions 
during the third quarter  indication of strong demand led to a high order rate 
after non cancelable production orders were placed  yields improved dramatically and the marketplace demand was lower than expected 
the company was under contractual agreement to pay a pre established per die price  and was unable to realize the benefit of the enhanced yields and was committed to take the increased volume 
these factors led to the inventory charge and the decrease in gross profit 
the company s overall gross profit and margin are subject to change due to various factors  including among others  competitive product pricing  unit volumes shipped  new product introductions  yields  wafer costs  assembly costs and product mix 
the company has encountered increased competition from other suppliers who are offering competitive products and new features 
in addition  the company expects the overall asps for its existing products to decline significantly over the life of the products 
the company believes that in order to maintain or increase gross profit  it must achieve higher unit volume shipments  cost reductions  new features and product introductions 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to ship higher volumes  reduce costs  add new features or introduce new products that gain market acceptance 
research and development expenses 
on going research and development expenses were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  in  and  respectively 
research and development in process represents one time pre and post tax charges of million from the acquisition of videocore and osee in the first quarter of and of million from the acquisition of platform in the second quarter of the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses from to is primarily due to the increase in the company s engineering staff  engineering test runs  masks  internal and external consultants and one time license fees 
the growth in on going research and development expenses between and was primarily due to the increase in the company s engineering staff  engineering test runs  masks  internal and external consulting expenses and licensing fees associated with the research and development efforts to support the introduction of new products 
the company expects that research and development expenses will remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated research and development expenses 
selling  general and administration expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administration expenses from to was primarily due to increase in commissions and bonuses on higher sales volumes  increased personnel and related expenses resulting from company s status as a public company 
the increase in selling  general and administration expenses from to was primarily attributable to increased spending for additional sales and administrative employees 
the increase in expense was also due to commissions on higher sales levels and  to a lesser extent  promotional expenses and costs associated with the expansion of the company s sales activities 
the company expects to incur higher selling  general and administrative expenses in the future due to the need to increase selling activities  although these expenses are expected to remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated selling  general and administrative expenses 
non operating income  net 
non operating income  net was million  million and million in  and respectively 
in  and non operating income  net consisted primarily of interest income and gains on sale of marketable securities  net of interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the company s tax rate for was at the combined federal and state statutory rate of 
the tax rate for of reflects a non deductible expense for the one time pre and post tax charge of million related to acquired research and development in process from the acquisition of videocore and osee in the first quarter the pro forma tax rate excluding this charge of million was 
the company s pro forma tax rate for was slightly lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of as a result of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits 
the reported tax rate for of of pre tax income significantly exceeds the combined federal and statutory tax rate of due to two charges that are not deductible in the federal and state returns 
the first charge is the one time pre and post tax charge of million for the acquisition of platform in the second quarter of the second is the charge to increase inventory reserves in the fourth quarter of because the majority of the inventories were held by a foreign subsidiary  a majority of the charges are not deductible on the us and state income tax returns 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated by operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and short term and long term debt 
at december   ess had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
as of december   the company had a million line of credit expiring on may   and a million line of credit expiring on june  these lines of credit require the company to achieve certain financial ratios and operating results 
at december   a criteria on one of the lines was not met 
a waiver was obtained during the first quarter of  and the company is in conformity with its borrowing criteria under these lines 
there were no borrowings under these lines of credit as of december  in  the company used net cash of million in operating activities 
this resulted from a net loss of million  a one time non cash charge for research and development in process of million and depreciation and amortization of million  less a gain on sale of short term investments of million and investment in working capital of million 
the company received net proceeds of million from sale of marketable equity securities  million from the issuance of common stock from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan  million in income tax credits from disqualifying disposition of common stock options and million from the acquisition of platform

the company received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock related to its initial public offering 
the company purchased million in short term investments and invested million in property and equipment 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased million 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  together with the cash generated from operations  available borrowings under its line of credit and other financing options  will be sufficient to fund acquisitions of property and equipment and provide adequate working capital through at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million of which approximately million will be used to fund construction of additional facilities and approximately million will be used to acquire capital equipment 
the company may also utilize cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company may evaluate potential acquisitions of or investment in such businesses  products or technologies owned by third parties 
the company also has bank lines of credit which may be utilized to provide additional cash 
factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those set forth below 
in any event  the matters set forth below should be carefully considered when evaluating the company s business and prospects 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the gain or loss of significant customers  increased competitive pressures  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  including decreases in unit asps of the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its customers products 
other factors include the availability of foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of raw materials  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the market for pcs  seasonal customer demand  the timing of significant orders and significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
there can be no assurance as to the level of sales or earnings that may be attained by the company in any given period in the future 
the company currently places noncancelable orders to purchase its products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis  while its customers generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be canceled without significant penalty 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition  pricing pressures 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  price declines and rapid product obsolescence 
see item business competition 
dependence on the pc and consumer markets 
in  and sales of pc audio semiconductor chips accounted for a majority of the company s net revenues  and the company expects that sales of audio semiconductors will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
in  sales of video semiconductor chips to the vcd player market accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues 
any reduction in asps or demand for the company s semiconductor chips  whether because of a reduction in demand for pcs or vcd players in general  increased competition or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is currently engaged in the development and introduction of new pc audio  video and fax modem semiconductor devices for the pc and consumer markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
a failure in any of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business audiodrive products  videodrive products and teledrive products 
the company s products are sold for incorporation into desktop and notebook computers and vcd players 
therefore  the company is heavily dependent on the continued growth of the markets and the cost requirements for desktop and notebook computers and vcd players 
there can be no assurance that these markets will be able to sustain continued growth 
a slowing in unit volume and a decrease in asps could result in a decline in revenues which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
importance of new products and technological change 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including timely completion of product development  market acceptance of the company s and its customers new products  securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers  achievement of acceptable wafer fabrication yields by the company s independent foundries and the company s ability to offer new products at competitive prices 
in order to succeed in having the company s products incorporated into new products being designed by its customers  the company must anticipate market trends and meet performance  quality and functionality requirements of such oems and must successfully develop and manufacture products that adhere to these requirements 
in addition  the company must meet the timing and price requirements of such manufacturers and must make such products available in sufficient quantities 
accordingly  in selling to oems  the company can often incur significant expenditures prior to volume sales of new products  if any 
in order to help accomplish these goals  the company has in the past and will continue to consider in the future the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies 
such acquisitions carry additional risks such as a lack of integration with existing products and corporate culture  the potential for large write offs and the diversion of management attention 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
a failure in any of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business research and development 
dependence on tsmc and other third parties 
the company relies on independent foundries to manufacture all of its products 
a substantial majority of the company s products are currently manufactured by tsmc  which has manufactured certain of the company s products since the company also has foundry arrangements with umc  which has manufactured certain of the company s products since these relationships provide the company with access to advanced process technology necessary for the manufacture of the company s products 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and  in certain cases  manufacture products of their own design 
in november  the company entered into long term agreements with tsmc and umc in which the company has secured access to additional capacity and to leading edge technology 
see item business manufacturing 
while the company has entered into long term agreements with its two foundries  the company s reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the international risks more fully described below 
in addition  the company has pre negotiated certain of its purchase orders and could be unable to benefit from enhanced yields realized by its vendors 
the company expects to rely upon tsmc and umc to manufacture substantially all of the company s products for the foreseeable future 
in the event that tsmc and umc are unable to continue to manufacture the company s key products in required volumes  the company will have to identify and secure additional foundry capacity 
in such an event  the company may be unable to identify or secure additional foundry capacity from another manufacturer 
even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer  the qualification process could take six months or longer 
the loss of any of its foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company to acquire additional capacity at its current suppliers or qualify other wafer manufacturers for additional foundry capacity should additional capacity be necessary  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in the supply of semiconductors to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  ess will continue to consider and may be required to enter into additional arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
any such arrangements could require the company to commit substantial capital and grant licenses to its technology 
the need to commit substantial capital may require the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
customer concentration 
a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in  and  sales to the company s top five customers  including sales to distributors  accounted for approximately  and respectively  of the company s net revenues 
in  compaq and universe electron corporation  the company s japanese distributor  each accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues 
in  compaq and universe electron corporation each accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
in  eastbase and dynax  a hong kong distributor  each accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues 
these customers purchased vcd devices  reflecting the company s revenue growth in that market 
sales to distributors are generally subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return and price protection with respect to unsold products 
returns and allowances in excess of reserves could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
during  the company adopted a policy of deferring revenue recognition on sales of devices to distributors in hong kong and taiwan until devices are sold to the end customers 
this has led to increased operational visibility on product moving through the channel 
the company expects that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern may continue 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of such major customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  since the company s products are often sole sourced to its customers  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will not be canceled or will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
management of growth 
during  the company experienced significant growth in unit shipments and the addition of multiple product lines that require additional management systems and processes 
to manage its future operations and growth effectively  the company will need to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems  implement additional systems and controls  and hire  train  motivate  manage and retain its employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such growth effectively  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international operations 
during  and  international sales accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
substantially all of the company s international sales were to customers in hong kong  taiwan  japan  korea and singapore 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of the company s products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
due to its reliance on international sales and foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international trade relationships 
although the company has not to date experienced any material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of such regulatory  geopolitical and other factors  there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
currently  all of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with foundries and assembly and test vendors provide for pricing and payment in us dollars 
in  the effect of significant currency fluctuations in asia had no material impact on the company 
there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date the company has not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although the company may do so in the future 
further  there can be no assurance that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or require the company to modify its current business practices 
semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of product prices 
although the semiconductor industry in recent periods has experienced increased demand  it is uncertain how long these conditions will continue 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary rights 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect its intellectual property rights 
see item business patents and proprietary rights  item legal proceedings 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of fred sl chan  the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors 
as of february   mr 
chan  together with his spouse  annie mh chan  a director of the company and certain trusts for the benefit of the chan s children and certain charities beneficially owned in the aggregate  approximately of the company s common stock 
the present and future success of the company depends on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified senior management  sales and technical personnel  particularly highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software engineers  for whom competition is intense 
the loss of mr 
chan  other key executive officers  key design personnel or software engineers or the inability to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain these employees 
the company currently does not maintain any key man life insurance on the life of any of its key employees 
control by existing shareholders 
as of february   fred sl chan  the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  together with his spouse  annie mh chan  a director of the company  and certain other shareholders related to mr 
and mrs 
chan owned  in the aggregate  of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  possess significant voting power over the company  giving them the ability among other things to influence significantly the election of the company s board of directors and approve significant corporate transactions 
such control could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of the company  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving the company  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company 
possible volatility of stock price 
the price of the company s common stock has in the past and may continue in the future to fluctuate widely 
future announcements concerning the company  its competitors or its principal customers  including quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations or litigation may cause the market price of the common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions or international currency fluctuations  may materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
year compliance 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
certain of the company s internal computer systems are not year compliant  and the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant 
failure of the company s internal computer systems or of such third party equipment or software  or of systems maintained by the company s suppliers  to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
patent litigation with creative technology  ltd 
on march   creative technology ltd 
and its subsidiary e mu systems  inc together  creative filed a lawsuit against the company and one of its customers  diamond multimedia systems  inc diamond  alleging infringement of us patent no 
 the patent  by the company s maestro products  one of which is included in products sold by diamond 
the complaint requests preliminary and permanent injunctions  and unspecified damages 
creative also claims willful infringement and requests treble damages and attorney s fees 
the lawsuit  entitled creative technology ltd 
et al v 
ess technology  inc et al  is pending in the us district court for the central district of california 
no date has been set for any hearing or for trial of the matter 
the company is still engaged in investigating the claim 
although the company believes that it does not infringe any valid claim of the patent  the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the lawsuit 
the grant of a preliminary or permanent injunction enjoining the sale of maestro products could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  including a reduction in the company s revenues and income  losses for an extended period of time and a depletion in the company s financial resources 
in addition  the company could be required to pay monetary damages to creative  which are subject to trebling in the event of a finding of willful infringement 
further  the company may have to indemnify diamond from liability with respect to claimed infringements of the patent and  in the event of a determination of infringement and the grant of an injunction  the company may have to compensate diamond for damages related to such determination and secure a license for diamond to continue using the enjoined chips  replace the chips with non infringing chips or remove the chips and refund the purchase price of such chips 
such indemnification could increase the company s exposure to  and amount of  potential costs and liability in such event  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with the creative litigation  the company may incur substantial legal and other expenses 
in addition  the creative litigation may divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel 
patent litigation is highly complex and can extend for a protracted period of time  which can substantially increase the cost of such litigation 
accordingly  the expenses and diversion of resources associated with the creative litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
