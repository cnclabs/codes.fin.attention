interest expense increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to million in the year ended september  primarily reflecting an increase in borrowings as a result of the july issuance of the notes which were utilized to fund the growth of the company s real estate finance and equipment leasing operations 
provision for possible losses increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september  the increase was primarily the result of increases in the provisions for possible losses relating to equipment leasing to million and for possible losses relating to real estate finance to 
the increased provisions reflect the increases in both lease originations and investments in real estate loans 
in establishing the company s allowance for possible losses in connection with its real estate finance and equipment leasing operations  the company considers among other things  the historic performance of the company s loan or lease portfolios  industry standards and experience regarding losses in similar loans or leases and payment history on specific loans and leases  as well as general economic conditions in the united states  in the borrower s or lessee s geographic area and in its specific industry 
the effective tax rate increased to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  the fiscal increase resulted from i an increase in the statutory tax rate due to an increase in the company s pre tax earnings  ii a decrease in the generation of depletion for tax purposes  iii a decrease in low income housing tax credits  iv a decrease in tax exempt interest in relationship to pre tax income  and v an increase in state income taxes 
the increase in effective tax rate resulted in an increased provision for taxes of million for over the tax that would have been payable had the tax rate been in effect

liquidity and capital resources year ended september  compared to year ended september  during the past three fiscal years  the company has derived its capital resources from three main sources public and private offerings of debt and equity securities  lines of credit and purchase facilities extended by banks and other institutional lenders with respect to equipment leaseing  residential mortgage and energy operations  and sales of senior lien interests in or borrower refinancings of commercial mortgage loans held in the company s portfolio 
the company has employed its available capital resources primarily in the expansion of its real estate finance and small ticket leasing businesses  and expects that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
however  through its acquisition of atlas  the company has significantly expanded its oil and gas operations and  as a result  may direct capital resources to oil and gas operations as other opportunities arise or as the company s oil and gas business develops 
the company believes that its future growth and earnings will be materially dependent upon its ability to continue to generate capital resources from prior sources or to identify new sources 
as a result of recent events in the capital markets including significant drops in the price of equity securities generally and the common stock in particular  as well as a loss of liquidity in credit markets  the company anticipates that generating additional capital resources on terms similar to those available to it during the last three fiscal years may be restricted 
accordingly  the company s ability to generate continued growth in its real estate finance and equipment leasing operations may be restricted  which could adversely affect the company s earnings potential

inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the company s operating expenses and increases in those expenses may not be recoverable by increases in finance rates chargeable by the company 
inflation also affects interests rates and movements in rates may adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s revenues and the value of its oil and gas properties have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to fluctuations which the company is unable to control or accurately predict 
computer systems and year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four digits  to identify the year in a date field 
any computer programs using such a system  and which have date sensitive software  will not be able to distinguish between the year and the year this could result in miscalculations or an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities  which could cause a disruption of business operations 
as is the case with most other businesses  the company is in the process of evaluating and addressing year compliance of both its information technology and non information technology systems collectively  the systems 
based upon a recent assessment by the company  the company has in place year capable systems for its commercial mortgage loan  equipment leasing and residential mortgage loan operations 
the company believes that the systems for its energy operations excluding those of atlas have completed approximately of the necessary remediation processes and that remediation including testing will be completed by march the company believes that its embedded systems such as natural gas monitoring systems and telephones are year compliant or  if not  are either not date dependent or would not materially affect the company s operations 
with respect to atlas systems  the company s post acquisition assessment has indicated that atlas is currently in the stage of implementing required remediation  which will include the purchase of a new central processing system 
the company believes that the necessary system is readily available in the retail market 
the company is also considering  however  merging atlas systems with the company s energy systems thereby largely eliminating remediation requirements 
the company anticipates that  whichever alternative is selected  atlas systems will be year compliant by september  as of september   the company s costs in remediation of its systems has not been material 
the company anticipates that its remaining remediation costs including costs relating to atlas systems will not exceed the company has initiated communications with all of its significant business partners through a vendor readiness survey to determine their year compliance 
responses are evaluated as they are received to determine if additional action is required to ensure compliance of the business partner 
as of september   all of the company s principal business partners have advised the company that they are year compliant or have initiated programs that will render them year compliant in a timely fashion 
as a result of its internal assessment and survey of its business partners  the company currently does not believe that year matters will have a material impact on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
to the extent that any of its business partners are materially affected by year problems  the company intends to seek alternative firms providing the same services that are year compliant 
in view of the responses from its current business partners  the company will identify alternative firms on an as needed basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company would be able to make appropriate arrangements should the need arise and  accordingly  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected if problems with its business partners arise 
the company is aware of the potential for claims against it and other companies for damages for products and services that were not year compliant 
since the company is neither a hardware manufacturer nor a software developer  the company believes that it does not have significant exposure to liability for such claims 
environmental regulation a continued trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry and the company 
the company monitors environmental and safety laws and believes it is in compliance with such laws and applicable regulations thereunder 
to date  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
the company believes  however  that environmental and safety costs will increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that compliance with such laws will not  in the future  materially impact the company
