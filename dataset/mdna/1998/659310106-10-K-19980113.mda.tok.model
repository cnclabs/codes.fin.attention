item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee and the managing director  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see item  legal proceedings  and note to financial statements contained herein 
the trust has no means of assuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which  with sales volumes  form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the deutsche mark dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  increased from the prior year 
a combination of higher gas prices  relatively uninterrupted gas production permitting increased overall gas sales  and increased gas sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg resulted in the higher royalty revenue 
this higher level of royalties occurred despite the decline in the average yearly value of the deutsche mark from to 
the average yearly price for gas under both the higher and lower royalty agreements increased by and respectively to and pfennigs per kwh 
compared to the prior year s quarterly averages  higher average gas prices occurred in each of the four quarters 
when converted into more familiar terms using the year s average exchange rate  gas prices were and per mcf under the higher and lower royalty agreements 
following the repairs to the gas pipeline and renovations of the grossenkneten desulfurization plant in the late summer of  gas production increased to its full capacity of  cubic meters per hour 
the resumption of full production allowed the operating companies to sell more than billion cubic feet bcf of gas from the entire oldenburg concession  an increase of from the prior year s sales 
the expansion of the desulfurization plant s capacity also permitted an increase in the relative volumes of gas drawn from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg 
gas sales from western oldenburg increased to more than bcf 
in addition  the percentage of western gas production to overall gas production increased from in to in without considering differences in prices  the impact of the higher royalty rate from western oldenburg is shown in the table on page detailing royalty income by geographic area 
despite accounting for less than of overall gas production  royalties from the sale of gas from western oldenburg are more than six times higher than royalties from eastern oldenburg 
with oldenburg gas sales accounting for over of the trust s royalties  non gas or non oldenburg royalties have a very minor impact on the trust 
royalties from sulfur  reflecting the continued exclusion of mobil s sulfur royalty obligation  amounted to only  royalties from oil amounted to  and continued to decline  reflecting the increasingly uneconomical nature of oil production in germany and the continuing capping of these uneconomical oil wells 
non oldenburg royalties amounted to only trust expenses for fiscal of  declined by from the prior year 
slightly higher interest rates along with larger sums available for investment resulted in a increase in interest income to  during fiscal and respectively  an additional and  trust units were issued and and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
in addition on april   pursuant to the settlement approved by the order of the delaware court of chancery  the trust issued  units to the delaware state escheator 
the increase in the number of issued units resulted in a dilution reducing subsequent per unit income by that percentage 
beyond the dilution from this and future issuances of units  the order will have no impact on the trust s financial condition  result of operations or long or short term liquidity 
the termination of liability for payment of arrears of dividends or distributions after the year as specified in the order of the delaware court of chancery is expected to benefit the trust s financial condition 
see note to financial statements contained herein 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  was lower than the previous year 
a combination of production interruptions  lower sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg  moderately weaker gas prices and less favorable currency exchange rates contributed to the decline in royalties 
the interruptions in production resulted from two events planned improvements to the grossenkneten desulfurization plant and a pipeline accident isolating the visbek and cappeln gas fields in western oldenburg 
the plant improvements occurred at two separate times from late april to early june and during the month of august and increased the plant capacity to  cubic meters of gas per hour 
during this combined week period  the plant was shut down completely for weeks and partially for weeks 
the pipeline accident occurred shortly after the resumption of production in early june 
production from these fields was totally shut down for weeks and partially shut down for weeks 
the net effect of these interruptions helped to reduce overall oldenburg gas sales by only to billion cubic feet 
however  gas sales from western oldenburg  with an effective royalty seven times greater than eastern oldenburg  were reduced by to billion cubic feet 
gas prices for both eastern and western oldenburg declined by and respectively 
from their lowest level experienced during the second quarter  gas prices have steadily climbed through the remainder of the year 
in addition  the average exchange rate for eastern and western oldenburg also declined by and respectively 
for the year the average value of the deutsche mark was cents down from last year s average of cents 
in prior years  note was made of the steps taken by the operating companies to maintain current sales levels despite the increasing ratio of sour gas to sweet gas in the total product mix 
these steps included improvements to the grossenkneten plant as well as the construction of a pipeline to the neag desulfurization plant to utilize excess capacity at that plant 
with the discovery of additional reserves outside oldenburg  the owners of the neag desulfurization plant are currently utilizing that plant s entire capacity for non oldenburg gas 
therefore the recent increases to the capacity at grossenkneten do not increase the total production capacity but instead permit that capacity to be maintained at the previous level of  cu 
meters per hour 
over of the trust s current year royalties came from oldenburg gas sales  royalties from oil sales were  and from sulfur sales were  during fiscal the trust did not receive any royalties under the mobil sulfur royalty obligation because prices remained below the threshold level specified in the agreement 
despite reaching over per metric ton recorded in the third quarter  sulfur prices ended the year below per metric ton 
trust expenses of  increased from the prior year reflecting increased legal expenses in connection with the settlement of the suit previously commenced by the delaware state escheator and with costs associated with investigations into the status of certain leases in germany 
despite higher average interest rates in effect  interest income declined by due to the decrease in funds available for investment 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional  and  trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
in addition on april   pursuant to the settlement approved by the order of the delaware court of chancery  the trust issued  units to the delaware state escheator 
the increase in the number of issued units resulted in a dilution reducing subsequent per unit income by that percentage 
beyond the dilution from this and future issuances of units  the order will have no impact on the trust s financial condition  result of operations or long or short term liquidity 
the termination of liability for payment of arrears of dividends or distributions after the year as specified in the order of the delaware court of chancery is expected to benefit the trust s financial condition
