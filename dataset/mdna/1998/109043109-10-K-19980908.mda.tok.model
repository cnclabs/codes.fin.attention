part i item business general briggs stratton corporation is the world s largest producer of air cooled gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment 
the company designs  manufactures  markets and services these products for original equipment manufacturers oems worldwide 
these engines are aluminum alloy gasoline engines ranging from through horsepower 
the company s engines are used primarily by the lawn and garden equipment industry  which accounted for of fiscal oem engine sales 
the major lawn and garden equipment applications include walk behind lawn mowers  riding lawn mowers and garden tillers 
the remaining of oem sales in fiscal were for use on many products for industrial  construction  agricultural and consumer applications  including generators  pumps and pressure washers 
many retailers specify the company s engines on the powered equipment they sell  and the briggs stratton name is often featured prominently on a product despite the fact that its engine is just a component 
briggs stratton engines are marketed under various brand names including classic tm  sprint tm  quattro tm  quantum r  intek tm  i c r  diamond i c r  industrial plus tm and vanguard tm 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s net sales were derived from sales in international markets  primarily to customers in europe 
briggs stratton serves its key international markets through its european regional office in switzerland  its distribution center in the netherlands and sales and service subsidiaries in australia  austria  canada  czech republic  france  germany  new zealand  sweden  the united kingdom and mexico 
the company is a leading supplier of gasoline engines in developed countries where there is an established lawn and garden equipment market 
the company also exports to developing nations where its engines are used in agricultural  marine  construction and other applications 
briggs stratton engines are sold primarily by its worldwide sales force through direct calls on customers 
the company s marketing staff and engineers provide support and technical assistance to its sales force 
briggs stratton also manufactures replacement engines and service parts and sells them to sales and service distributors 
the company owns its principal international distributors 
in the united states the distributors are independently owned and operated 
these distributors supply service parts and replacement engines directly to approximately  independently owned authorized service dealers throughout the world 
these distributors and service dealers implement briggs stratton s commitment to reliability and service 
customers the company s sales are primarily made directly to original equipment manufacturers 
the company s three largest customers accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to the company s largest engine customer  mtd products inc  were  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to its second largest customer  ab electrolux including its frigidaire home products group  were  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  and sales to its third largest customer  tomkins plc including its murray subsidiary products  were  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
under purchasing plans available to all of its gasoline engine customers  the company typically enters into annual engine supply arrangements with these large customers 
the company has no reason to anticipate a change in this practice or in its historical business relationships with these equipment manufacturers 
over the past several years  sales in the united states of lawn and garden equipment by mass merchandisers have increased significantly  while sales by independent distributors and dealers have declined 
the company believes that in more than of all lawn and garden equipment sold in the united states was sold through mass merchandisers such as sears  wal mart  kmart  home depot and lowe s 
given the buying power of the mass merchandisers  the company  through its customers  has experienced pricing pressure 
the company expects that this trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
the company believes that a similar trend has developed for commercial products for industrial and consumer applications 
competition the small gasoline engine industry is highly competitive 
the company s major domestic competitors in engine manufacturing are tecumseh products company  honda motor co  ltd  kohler co 
and kawasaki heavy industries  ltd 
also  two domestic lawn mower manufacturers  toro co 
under its lawn boy brand  and honda  manufacture their own engines 
eight japanese small engine manufacturers  of which honda and kawasaki are the largest  compete directly with the company in world markets in the sale of engines and indirectly through their sale of end products that compete with the end products produced by the company s customers 
tecumseh europa spa  located in italy  is a major competitor in europe 
the company believes the major areas of competition from all engine manufacturers include product quality  brand strength  price  timely delivery and service 
other factors affecting competition are short term market share objectives  short term profit objectives  exchange rate fluctuations  technology and product support and distribution strength 
briggs stratton believes its product quality and service reputation have given it strong brand name recognition and enhance its competitive position 
seasonality of demand sales of engines to lawn and garden equipment manufacturers are highly seasonal because of the buying patterns of retail customers 
the majority of lawn and garden equipment is sold during the spring and summer months when most lawn care and gardening activities are performed 
sales of lawn and garden equipment are also influenced by weather conditions 
sales in the company s fiscal third quarter have historically been the highest  while sales in the first fiscal quarter have historically been the lowest 
the sale of lawn and garden equipment has shifted from smaller dealers to larger mass merchandisers  who do not wish to carry large inventories of lawn and garden equipment 
in order to efficiently use its capital investments and meet seasonal demand for engines  the company pursues a balanced production schedule throughout the year  subject to ongoing adjustment to reflect changes in estimated demand  customer inventory levels and other matters outside the control of the company 
accordingly  inventory levels are generally higher during the first and second fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased customer demand in the third fiscal quarter  at which time inventory levels begin to decrease as sales increase 
in recent years  lawn and garden equipment manufacturers have tended to place orders with engine manufacturers and to take deliveries later in the selling season  specifically later in the company s third fiscal quarter and in the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
this seasonal pattern results in high inventories and receivables and low cash for the company in the second and the beginning of the third fiscal quarters  with a rapid shift to lower inventories and receivables and ultimately higher cash in the latter portion of the third fiscal quarter and in the fourth fiscal quarter

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales for fiscal totaled  million  up or million from the preceding year 
this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in sales dollars due to a increase in engine unit shipments and a million increase in service parts sales due to increased demand 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales dollars due to a mix change to lower horsepower  lower priced engines and a million decrease in revenue from european customers with whom the company shares currency risk 
gross profit the gross profit margin for the fiscal year increased to from in the fiscal year 
the primary reason for this favorable change was the lack of the million charge related to the early retirement window described later 
there was also a million increase due to improvements in manufacturing productivity 
these were offset by the million in lost gross profit due to the reduced revenue from european customers described above 
engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or between years 
this increase was caused primarily by the costs associated with the new company wide information system which totaled million discussed later and increased costs of new venture activities which totaled million  of which million related to the company s powercom software business 
the company signed a letter of intent for the sale of its powercom software business shortly after the end of the fiscal year 
this sale is not expected to result in any material gains or losses 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year was million higher than in this resulted from using increased domestic short term borrowings to finance seasonal increases in accounts receivable and inventories during the year and an increase in long term debt over the preceding year 
seasonal borrowings were paid off by the end of the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate decreased to in from in the previous year 
this was due primarily to reductions in the foreign tax provision and in other tax related items that were individually insignificant 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales for fiscal increased or million compared to the prior year 
the primary reason for this was a increase in engine unit shipments 
the remaining increase in net sales was a result of modest price increases and a mix improvement 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal decreased or million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the primary reason for this decrease was a charge of million related to an early retirement window accepted by certain milwaukee hourly employees in accordance with the current union contract 
the gross profit rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in addition to the early retirement window  the gross profit rate was also negatively impacted by increases in warranty expenses totaling million due to claims experience  increases in the unit price of aluminum totaling million  and the absence in fiscal of the million credit for employees who had accepted early retirement in fiscal and canceled their acceptance in fiscal savings from lower labor costs at the company s new engine plants partially offset the preceding factors impacting the gross profit rate 
engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased or million compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation of million  planned increases in manpower and other costs of million relating to new venture activities  and increased professional services of million primarily resulting from the start of the implementation of a new enterprise wide information system 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate used in both periods was 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and cash flows from operating activities was million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary source of funds was from net income excluding depreciation 
the significant change between fiscal and fiscal amounts was due to changes in working capital as explained below 
the fiscal cash flow from operating activities reflects a million increase in accounts receivable and an million decrease in inventories resulting from increased sales late in the last fiscal quarter 
the fiscal cash flow from operating activities reflects an increase in accounts receivable of million and lower inventories of million resulting from increased sales at the end of the fiscal year when compared to the previous year 
also  increased accounts payable of million caused by the timing of payments  increased accrued liabilities of million resulting primarily from increased profit sharing provisions  and increased federal and state income taxes payable of million caused by the timing of payments  all contributed to the cash flows of the company 
the fiscal cash flow from operating activities reflects an increase in receivables of million resulting from higher sales at the end of the fiscal year and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million primarily due to decreased profit sharing provisions 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities included additions to plant and equipment of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal capital expenditures principally related to investment in equipment 
the fiscal capital expenditures related primarily to reinvestment in equipment and new products  while the fiscal expenditures principally related to the construction of three new engine manufacturing plants and a foundry and plant expansions at existing facilities 
the cash flows from investing activities also included million related to the sale of the menomonee falls  wisconsin facility 
the sale of this facility is described under other matters 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these financing activities included the repurchase of the company s common stock  totaling million in and million in in each of fiscal and  million was paid on the senior notes due cash dividends totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the cash dividends in were less than those paid in the preceding two years because the common stock repurchase program resulted in less stock outstanding in that year 
in fiscal  the company issued ten year notes which resulted in million of net proceeds from the offering 
the million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in was substantially higher than in prior years due to increased option activity 
future liquidity and capital resources the company has in place a million revolving credit facility to be used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs 
this credit facility expires in april and contains certain restrictive covenants 
because the company has been using some available cash in its ongoing stock repurchase program  the company will be placing more reliance on borrowings to fund working capital needs than it did prior to fiscal accordingly  the company experienced higher interest expense in fiscal  and anticipates interest expense to remain at such higher levels in the future 
in may  the company filed a shelf registration for million of debt securities to be issued periodically 
of this  million has not yet been issued on the registration statement 
the company may decide to offer all or part of the remaining securities depending on many factors  including general economic conditions  cash required for operations and the timing of the remaining open market repurchases of its common stock 
management expects capital expenditures to total million in fiscal  consisting of projects which include reinvestment in equipment and new products 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from operations  existing lines of credit and access to public debt markets will be adequate to fund the company s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial strategy management of the company subscribes to the premise that the value of the company is enhanced if the capital invested in the company s operations yields a cash return that is greater than the company s cost of capital 
given this belief  the company implemented this financial strategy by means of a dutch auction tender offer described below and a public debt offering in fiscal the company also continued the repurchase of its outstanding common stock in the open market in the fiscal year 
the company believes this will provide a capital structure that makes greater use of financial leverage without imposing excessive risk on either the company s shareholders or creditors 
the company also believes that the substitution of lower after tax cost debt for equity in its permanent capital structure will reduce its overall cost of capital and that its profitability and strong cash flows will accommodate the increased use of debt without impairing its ability to finance growth or increase cash dividends per share on its common stock 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of shares of its common stock by means of a tender offer and open market or private transactions 
as of june   purchases totaled million 
future purchases will depend on many factors  including the market price of the shares  the company s business and financial position  and general economic and market conditions 
the company intends to fund any future purchases of its common stock through a combination of available cash  cash generated from operations and additional borrowings 
also as a part of its financial strategy  subject to the discretion of its board of directors and the requirements of applicable law  the company currently intends to increase future cash dividends per share at a rate approximating the inflation rate 
other matters year issues the company is implementing a new company wide information system 
this new system is expected to address the great majority of information technology year computer issues 
the new system will replace the company s mainframe computer  which is being retired in early calendar the new system has been installed and implementation has been completed in approximately one half of the company s us operations 
other internal year issues not directly related to the previously described project are being addressed and tested in parallel with the main project 
these are expected to be completed by the middle of the calendar year 
project expenditures to date total million 
the company expects to incur an additional million of incremental costs  running through the fiscal year  because of related projects 
the company has developed an overall comprehensive year program to address year issues 
this program is based on the automotive industry action group s model system consisting of five steps awareness  inventory and assessment  remediation  testing  and readiness certification 
oversight of the program is the responsibility of a group of senior executives with progress reported to the company s board of directors 
a risk assessment and exposure analysis has been made  and each area has been ranked as high  medium or low 
the company s high risk areas have been identified as information technology systems and infrastructures  customers  suppliers  and financial institutions 
the software for a new company wide information system  which is broad based  has already been installed and is effectively in use for over of company operations 
and since remaining operations are substantially similar  management does not anticipate the need to develop an extensive contingency plan for information technology systems 
the non information technology systems are midway through the assessment phase and remediation is scheduled for completion by mid calendar year without material incremental costs anticipated 
based on the assessment of its non information technology systems to date  the company currently does not anticipate the need to develop an extensive contingency plan for non information systems  so it is not expecting to incur material incremental costs to do this 
the company s largest customers have certified that they will be year compliant before the end of calendar year  as to their relationships with the company 
the identification of critical vendors has been completed and a survey is scheduled for completion by the first quarter of calendar year alternative suppliers will be identified for those not expected to be compliant by the end of  as to their relationships with the company 
the company s financial institutions are currently being surveyed and it is anticipated that they are year compliant  or will be before the end of calendar year selected areas  both internal and external  will be tested to assure the integrity of the company s remediation programs 
the testing will be completed by mid calendar year it is anticipated that any requisite changes necessary to become year compliant will be completed prior to mid calendar year and contingency plans will be developed  as necessary  to address unforeseen circumstances prior to the end of calendar year the company believes its year program is adequate to detect in advance year compliance issues  and that it has the necessary resources to remedy them 
however  the year problem has many aspects and potential consequences  some of which are not reasonably foreseeable  and there can be no assurance that unforeseen consequences will not arise 
emissions the us environmental protection agency epa is developing national emission standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines 
the company currently has a complete product offering which complies with epa s phase i engine emission standards 
the epa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for phase ii emission standards in january of incorporating the agreement in principle reached between epa and several engine manufacturers  including the company 
this proposed phase ii program will impose more stringent standards over the useful life of the engine and will be phased in from to epa expects to finalize the phase ii regulation by the end of while it is impossible to precisely quantify the cost of compliance until the standards are issued  the company believes compliance with the new standards will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the california air resources board carb staff completed a review of the existing tier ii standards and proposed that alternative standards and implementation dates be adopted by carb 
alternative tier ii standards were adopted by carb at its march  meeting and are not harmonized with epa s proposed phase ii  but rather require the accelerated introduction of overhead valve engine technology into california 
in addition  individual companies which sell more than a threshold number of class i engines into california must submit a supplemental compliance plan to carb to achieve additional reductions in extreme non attainment areas 
while carb s aggressive program may result in a reduced product offering by the company in california  it is not anticipated that the california program will have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
sale of the menomonee falls  wisconsin facility the sale of the company s menomonee falls  wisconsin facility for approximately million was completed during fiscal the provisions of the contract state that the company will continue to own and occupy the warehouse portion of the facility for a period of up to ten years the reservation period 
the contract also contains a buyout clause  at the buyer s option and under certain circumstances  of the remaining reservation period 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  the company is required to account for this as a financing transaction as the company continues to have substantial involvement with the facility during the reservation period or until the buyout option is exercised 
under this method  the cash received is reflected as a deferred revenue  and the assets and the accumulated depreciation remain on the company s books 
depreciation expense continues to be recorded each period  and imputed interest expense is also recorded and added to deferred revenue 
offsetting this is the fair value lease income on the non company occupied portion of the building 
a pretax gain  which will be recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the buyout option or the expiration of the reservation period  is estimated to be million to million 
the annual cost of operating the warehouse portion of the facility is not material 
new accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board adopted financial accounting standard no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this new standard will be effective for the company in fiscal  and requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
any fair value changes will be recorded in net income or comprehensive income 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies primarily as a result of purchasing engines from its japanese joint venture 
the company s foreign subsidiaries earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of the local currency against the us dollar as these subsidiaries purchase inventory from the parent in us dollars 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at june   the company had the following forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the fair value gains and losses shown in thousands notional us fair value currency value dollars gains and losses japanese yen    australian dollars all of the above contracts expire in less than one year 
although the company sells its domestically produced engines to foreign customers in us dollars  the company has shared some of the currency risk with customers for certain sales transactions 
accordingly  the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  primarily related to the us dollar european currency unit rate 
historically  the company has managed these risks through limitations on the amount of sharing provided to customers 
these programs are generally for one year 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the stockholders equity of the company 
amounts invested in the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the dollar was stronger relative to many of the foreign currencies at june  compared to june  consequently  the cumulative translation adjustments component of stockholders equity decreased million during the year 
using the year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in subsidiaries at june  was approximately million 
interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings 
the company manages its interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
depending on general economic conditions  the company has typically used variable rate debt for short term borrowings and fixed rate debt for longer term borrowings 
at june   the company had the following short term loans outstanding amount in thousands average annual currency amount interest rate german mark  british pounds dutch guilder  irish punt canadian dollars  swedish krona  french franc us dollars  all of the above loans carry variable interest rates 
long term loans consisted of the following amounts in thousands description amount maturity senior notes   in fiscal  and notes  each of the above loans carries a fixed rate of interest
