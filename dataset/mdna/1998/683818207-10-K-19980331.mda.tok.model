item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition due to the nature of the company s business  the key components of its financial condition constitute receivables  inventory  fixed assets  accounts payable  and debt 
the company saw an increase in net worth to  in prior year trends of key financial indicators show a change in corporate net worth of  for compared to  in the current ratio decreased to from in and in this was due to increases in current note payable  trade payables  and the dilutive effect of the paragon acquisition on the current ratio 
total corporate accounts receivable including paragon were  year end billed accounts receivable was  billed accounts receivable were  at year end and  in the increase in accounts receivable was due to the general increase in business and the addition of paragon s receivable base 
in  outstanding days for receivables was days 
accounts receivable outstanding averaged days in  and days in the increase in days receivable occurred primarily because of extended payment terms requested by some of our larger customers 
optelecom continues to maintain an aggressive accounts collection program 
bad debt write offs represent less than of one percent of the total yearly revenues 
the low level of bad debts is due partly to the percentage of business the company does with the us government and fortune companies 
the company also uses a careful screening process and performs credit qualification of customers before accepting their orders 
for any new account  credit checks are always conducted  and questionable situations are either placed on a cod or a letter of credit basis 
accounts receivable is closely monitored  those that are delinquent are continuously contacted until payment is received 
the overall composition of the inventory has changed somewhat over the last three years as shown in the following chart paragon inventory is included which is composed solely of finished goods 
inventory composition production materials    net of allowance work in process    finished goods    total    one of the tools the company uses for trend analysis is a comparison of our inventory levels to total sales 
in  this level was compared to in and in the value of the raw material and work in process inventory decreased by approximately  in compared to the small increase in work in process reflects orders to be shipped in early the increase in finished goods reflects growth in cpd inventory and the addition of the paragon inventory  although our objective is to reduce inventory levels as much as possible  the value of finished goods inventory increased substantially in to provide products available from stock 
this action was taken to meet competitive pressures  as customers are demanding shorter product delivery times 
the company has reduced the amount of raw material inventory to partially offset the higher level of finished goods inventory 
the company believes that its reserve for inventory obsolescence is adequate to properly value any excess quantities of this inventory 
in  fixed asset additions  excluding the paragon acquisition  were  compared to  in and  in results of operations consolidated revenues were higher than and higher than consolidated revenues include  from paragon subsequent to the december  acquisition date 
a net profit of  which represented of revenue for  compares to a net profit of  for  and loss of  for reasons for these changes are explained below 
government products division gpd electro optics technology group e o technology group s revenues increased compared to the increase occurred primarily due to additional work from darpa and honeywell systems and contract coil winding work 
we believe that the unique work performed by this group may have enough market potential to maintain break even or profitability in revenue for the last three years was  in   in  and  in comparable period profits losses were   and 
cost of sales the cost of sales as a percent of revenue has decreased significantly due an increase in revenue as mentioned above and a decrease in overhead costs as discussed below 
given below are the last three years results cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue overhead and g a overhead overhead costs for the e o technology group were  in   in and  in overhead expenses have decreased due to lower labor costs within the group and a lower corporate expense allocation 
the allocated costs are apportioned as a percent of floor space assigned to revenue generating activities and have been reduced as the group s facility space requirements have been optimized to meet their current needs 
g a g a expenses for the division were  in   in and  in these numbers reflect a lower expense in  due to a reassignment of some of the activities of the management personnel from divisional work to the corporate area 
laser illuminator technology group was another very successful year for this group 
the air force will require ongoing support for the glint laser illuminator system for at least the next several years 
while it is difficult to quantify the level of potential business  it is likely that optelecom will provide products and maintenance support during that period 
revenue for was  compared to  in and  in net profits were  for   for  and  for the slight decrease in the level of revenue in compared to was due to fewer air force requirements based on the number of serviceable aircraft 
in  contract work consisted of refurbishment of complete illuminator systems  in  work consisted essentially of fabrication of spare laser arrays  with a small additional effort associated with contract development work 
cost of sales although overhead costs for the three year period were relatively constant  the large increase in revenue in and caused the cost of sales as a percent of revenue to decrease compared to the lower percentage cost is also due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower part cost 
cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue overhead overhead costs for the glint division were  for compared to  for and  for overhead expenses have remained relatively stable for the last several years due to stable work force and facility size 
g a the general and administrative expenses were  in   in and  for the increase over and reflects higher corporate allocation  which is apportioned on the basis of percent revenue compared to corporate revenue 
research and development division r d in  optelecom started a separate development project distinct from all other company activities to work on a new telecommunications product 
this effort had no revenues and incurred  in cost 
work in this area was discontinued at the end of communication products division cpd in  the communication products division revenues increased by over and resulted in an operating profit of  compared to a profit of  in the product sales mix was more favorable in  with system integrator sales up significantly and low margin product sales down compared to new products in fiber optic trader desk and air traffic control video monitors and lower cost designs helped increase revenues 
the company was successful in implementing product designs specifically intended to be produced by automatic assembly processes to minimize direct costs 
revenues and profits generated by paragon were insignificant to the division s and company s consolidated results of operations for the year 
cost of sales cost of sales is the sum of direct costs to produce the product and overhead costs 
although the comparative direct costs rose slightly as a percent of revenue see discussion below  the company did not have to discount prices as much as in to achieve these sales  therefore the relative cost of sales declined compared to cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue direct costs in  direct costs increased slightly in relation to revenue 
this reflected the impact of the introduction into manufacture of several new products which required some design changes to meet all performance criteria 
however  the cost to produce products continued to decrease due to the investment in automated manufacturing facilities 
as more of our product designs evolve toward automated assembly  our ability to successfully compete at lower sale prices will continue to improve 
direct costs versus sales direct costs    percent of sales overhead overhead costs include facilities costs  indirect labor costs in manufacturing  applied overhead  and inventory write offs 
in  overhead cost as a percent of sales fell by due to an increase in sales which resulted in positive manufacturing efficiencies and greater applied overhead 
absolute overhead costs increased in by approximately  compared to included below is a comparison of overhead costs for the past three years cost comparison overhead costs    overhead costs as a percent of revenue applied overhead applied overhead allocates costs in overhead to a final product 
the company uses a computation method in which overhead costs are divided by direct labor costs 
this establishes the percent of overhead costs to be applied to the final product 
examples of these costs include rent  utilities  telephone  inventory variances  and depreciation of production capital equipment costs 
applied overhead amounts for the past three years were  in   in  and  in inventory write offs direct inventory write offs decreased slightly in to  compared to  in and  in generally  these write offs are due to engineering changes  which result in obsolete raw materials and subassemblies used on products we no longer intend to sell  and also to overstocking of particular items 
although we make every attempt to minimize obsolete inventory  the rapid engineering evolution of our product line and the changes in our product mix makes some obsolescence unavoidable 
inventory reserves have increased in relative dollar amounts due to the increase in sales and production 
g a general and administrative costs consist primarily of expenses related to sales  marketing and engineering activities and other administrative operational costs 
commercial product engineering development costs have increased  reflecting increased staff size and workload 
during  development focussed on additions to the product line for compressed digital video equipment and air traffic control equipment 
the three year record of these engineering costs exclusive of fringe is  in   in and  in the company implemented changes to the sales and marketing staff to more closely align the technical aspects of the selling process with customer requirements and also changed the corporate management staff to strengthen the division s efforts 
advertising costs increased substantially in these costs include advertising in trade magazines  participation in trade shows and product literature  including catalogs and specification sheets 
compared to prior years  the type of advertising changed as a result of a redirection of our advertising emphasis 
advertising expenditure increases occurred mainly in the areas of magazines and trade shows 
the costs of advertising and other marketing efforts for the last three years were  in   in and  in the cost of this effort as well as profit sharing expenses and reserves for bad debt are reflected in the increased g a expenses for this year  which were  prior year costs were  in and  in other operating expenses corporate income tax expense benefit was  in   in and  in this reflects the company s continued profitability 
the effective tax rate was in and in in the effective tax rate was as a result of the net operating loss during the year 
the effective tax rate is positively influenced by increased overseas sales  since certain tax advantages can be realized through our foreign sales corporation fsc 
interest expense was  in compared to  for and increased from  in the majority of the interest expense   in  is reflective of increased borrowings related to the paragon acquisition 
impact of inflation inflation has not had any significant effect on the operations of the company during  and we do not expect it to have any significant effect during liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are largely generated by working capital needs 
these needs are primarily focussed on financing inventories and accounts receivable 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in in  as a result of a net operating loss and increases in inventory balances  net cash used in operational activities was 
non cash outlays such as depreciation and amortization were  in the depreciation for was  and  in cash used in investing activities in was  and included expenditures of  for paragon  capital equipment for manufacturing operations  facility upgrades  and general office equipment 
to finance these activities  optelecom used existing cash flows  borrowing in short term notes  long term borrowings for equipment and a new million debt agreement to finance the purchase of paragon 
no other material changes in cash flow are expected 
the company has the ability  provided there are sufficient eligible receivables  to borrow up to  under its line of credit as of december  the company also has the ability to borrow funds for specific capital asset purchases to a maximum of  from a local bank 
loans for these assets are collateralized by the specific equipment asset and payable over no more than five years 
at the end of  the outstanding balance under the line of credit agreement was  and no accounts were outstanding under the available equipment loan 
on december   the company s subsidiary  paragon  had been advanced  under a factoring agreement 
in february  the company terminated the factoring agreement and settled all outstanding liabilities under the agreement 
paragon s future working capital needs are expected to be financed by its operating cash flows or inter company loans from the company 
paragon is operating as a stand alone entity 
the expectation is that it will operate off its own line of credit 
should the need arise for increased cash due to increased business activity  additional funding needs will be addressed 
management anticipates that operating cash flows will generate the long term cash requirements of optelecom and paragon 
if the level of business should dictate  other infusions of capital may be needed 
paragon s business is transacted in british pounds 
the results of operations may be affected by foreign exchange gains losses 
currently neither optelecom nor paragon have hedging strategies in place 
year many of the world s computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business interruptions 
optelecom has established an internal committee to address this problem 
the company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to upgrade its information  technology  and manufacturing and facilities computer software to programs that will consistently and properly recognize the year many of the company s systems include new hardware and packaged software recently purchased from large vendors who have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances from vendors that timely updates will be made available to make all remaining purchased software year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to preprogram or replace and test all of its software for year compliance  and the company expects to complete the project in early the estimated cost of this project is not deemed to be significant 
this cost is being funded through operating cash flows 
failure by the company and or vendors and customers to complete year compliance work in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company s operations
