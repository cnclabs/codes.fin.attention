natural gas equivalents and crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of six mcf to one bbl 
bbl means a barrel of us gallons of oil 
bcf means one billion cubic feet of natural gas 
bcfe means one billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
completion means the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or gas 
condensate means a hydrocarbon mixture that becomes liquid and separates from natural gas when the gas is produced and is similar to crude oil 
development well means a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive 
dry hole means a well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes 
exploratory well means a well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves not classified as proved  to find a new productive reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir 
gross when used with respect to acres or wells  production or reserves refers to the total acres or wells in which the company or other specified person has a working interest 
mbbls means one thousand barrels of oil 
mcf means one thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
mcfe means thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
mmcf means one million cubic feet of natural gas 
mmcfe means one million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
net when used with respect to acres or wells  refers to gross acres of wells multiplied  in each case  by the percentage working interest owned by the company 
net production means production that is owned by the company less royalties and production due others 
oil means crude oil or condensate 
operator means the individual or company responsible for the exploration  development  and production of an oil or gas well or lease 
present value of proved reserves means the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves calculated in accordance with commission guidelines  net of estimated production and future development costs  using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation  without giving effect to non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service  future income tax expense and depreciation  depletion and amortization  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
proved developed reserves means reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery will be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved reserves means the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
i reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation tests 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes a that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and b the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
ii reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
iii estimates of proved reserves do not include the following a oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  b crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  c crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and d crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such resources 
proved undeveloped reserves means reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
recompletion means the completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed 
royalty means an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage or of the proceeds of the sale thereof  but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage 
royalties may be either landowner s royalties  which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted  or overriding royalties  which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner 
d seismic means an advanced technology method of detecting accumulations of hydrocarbons identified by the collection and measurement of the intensity and timing of sound waves transmitted into the earth as they reflect back to the surface 
working interest means an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations 
the share of production to which a working interest owner is entitled will always be smaller than the share of costs that the working interest owner is required to bear  with the balance of the production accruing to the owners of royalties 
for example  the owner of a working interest in an lease burdened only by a landowner s royalty of would be required to pay of the costs of a well but would be entitled to retain of the production 
workover means operations on a producing well to restore or increase production 
forward looking statements all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report  including without limitation  statements under business and properties and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding budgeted capital expenditures  increases in oil and natural gas production  the company s financial position  oil and natural gas reserve estimates  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimate and such revision  if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
all forward looking statements in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph

oil and natural gas reserves the following tables set forth the estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves of the company and the present value of proved reserves as of december present value of oil gas total proved category mbbls mmcf mmcfe reserves s proved developed producing     proved developed non producing     proved undeveloped     total proved     there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth above represents estimates only 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based on the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas reserves that are ultimately recovered 
in general  the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent the company acquires properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced 
the company s future oil and natural gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon its level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves 
drilling activity summary during the three year period ended december   the company drilled development and exploratory wells as set forth in the table below year ended december  gross net gross net gross net development wells oil gas dry exploratory wells oil gas dry total wells as of december   two development wells net were in the process of being drilled

all of the company s oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under the company s bank credit facility 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  the company is generally able to retain its ownership interest in undeveloped acreage by production of existing wells  by drilling activity which establishes commercial reserves sufficient to maintain the lease or by payment of delay rentals 
markets and customers the market for oil and natural gas produced by the company depends on factors beyond its control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  demand for oil and natural gas  the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation 
the oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
substantially all of the company s natural gas production is sold either on the spot gas market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or under long term contracts based on current spot market gas prices 
gas production from the company s double a wells field is sold under a long term contract to hpl resources company  a subsidiary of enron corp 
hpl 
the agreement with hpl is for a term expiring on october  with pricing based on a percentage of spot gas prices for natural gas delivered to the houston ship channel 
total gas sales in to hpl accounted for approximately of the company s oil and gas sales 
all of the company s oil production is sold at the well site at posted field prices tied to the spot oil markets 
sales of oil production to scurlock permian corporation  a subsidiary of ashland inc  accounted for approximately of the company s oil and gas sales 
competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
competitors include major oil companies  other independent energy companies  and individual producers and operators  many of which have financial resources  personnel and facilities substantially greater than those of the company 
the company faces intense competition for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
regulation the company s operations are regulated by certain federal and state agencies 
in particular  oil and natural gas production and related operations are or have been subject to price controls  taxes and other laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry 
the company cannot predict how existing laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings  whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted  or the effect such changes may have on its business or financial condition 
the company s oil and natural gas exploration  production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal  state and local agencies 
failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the company s cost of doing business and affects its profitability 
because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted  the company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws 
the states of texas and louisiana require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas 
such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the regulation of spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
the statutes and regulations of certain states limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced from the company s properties 
sales of natural gas by the company are not regulated and are made at market prices 
however  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates interstate and certain intrastate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions  which affect the marketing of natural gas produced by the company  as well as the revenues received by the company for sales of such production 
since the mid s  ferc has issued a series of orders  culminating in order nos 
 a and b order  that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of gas 
order mandates a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation service  including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales  transportation  storage and other components of the city gate sales services such pipelines previously performed 
one of ferc s purposes in issuing the orders was to increase competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
order and subsequent ferc orders issued in individual pipeline restructuring proceedings have been the subject of appeals  the results of which have generally been supportive of the ferc s open access policy 
earlier this year the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit largely upheld order no 
 et seq 
because further review of certain of these orders is still possible  and other appeals remain pending  it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the orders on the company and its gas marketing efforts 
generally  order has eliminated or substantially reduced the interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas  and has substantially increased competition and volatility in natural gas markets 
while significant regulatory uncertainty remains  order may ultimately enhance the company s ability to market and transport its gas  although it may also subject the company to greater competition and the more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater associated penalties for violation of such tolerances 
sales of oil and natural gas liquids by the company are not regulated and are made at market prices 
the price the company receives from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market 
effective as of january   ferc implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for interstate common carrier oil pipelines  which  generally  would index such rates to inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
these regulations could increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines  although the most recent adjustment generally decreased rates 
these regulations have generally been approved on judicial review 
the company is not able to predict with certainty what effect  if any  these regulations will have on it  but  other factors being equal  the regulations may  over time  tend to increase transportation costs or reduce wellhead prices for oil and natural liquids 
the company is required to comply with various federal and state regulations regarding plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells 
the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of plugging and abandoning its wells  to the extent such costs exceed the estimated salvage value of the wells  on a unit of production basis 
environmental various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  health and safety  affect the company s operations and costs 
these laws and regulations sometimes require governmental authorization before certain activities  limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species  impose substantial liabilities for pollution related to company operations or properties  and provide penalties for noncompliance 
in particular  the company s drilling and production operations  its activities in connection with storage and transportation of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons  and its use of facilities for treating  processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and related exploration and production wastes are subject to stringent environmental regulation 
as with the industry generally  compliance with existing and anticipated regulations increases the company s overall cost of business 
while these regulations affect the company s capital expenditures and earnings  the company believes that such regulations do not affect its competitive position in the industry because its competitors are similarly affected by environmental regulatory programs 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change and  therefore  the company is potentially unable to predict the future costs or other future impacts of environmental regulations on its future operations 
a discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could subject the company to substantial expense  including the cost to comply with applicable regulations that require a response to the discharge  such as containment or cleanup  claims by neighboring landowners or other third parties for personal injury  property damage or their response costs and penalties assessed  or other claims sought  by regulatory agencies for response cost or for natural resource damages 
the following are examples of some environmental laws that potentially impact the company and its operations 
water 
the oil pollution act opa was enacted in and amends provisions of the federal water pollution control act of fwpca and other statutes as they pertain to prevention of and response to major oil spills 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and certain other consequences of an oil spill  where such spill is into navigable waters  or along shorelines 
in the event of an oil spill into such waters  substantial liabilities could be imposed upon the company 
states in which the company operates have also enacted similar laws 
regulations are currently being developed under the opa and similar state laws that may also impose additional regulatory burdens on the company 
the fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters  other oil and gas wastes  any form of pollutant  and  in some instances  storm water runoff  into waters of the united states 
the fwpca provides for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges and  along with the opa  imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation or damages resulting from an unauthorized discharge 
state laws for the control of water pollution also provide civil  criminal and administrative penalties and liabilities in the case of an unauthorized discharge into state waters 
the cost of compliance with the opa and the fwpca have not historically been material to the company s operations  but there can be no assurance that changes in federal  state or local water pollution control programs will not materially adversely effect the company in the future 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
air emissions 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in late the caa amendments require or will require most industrial operations in the united states to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emissions control standards developed by the environmental protection agency epa and state environmental agencies 
the caa amendments impose a new operating permit on major sources  and several of the company s facilities may require permits under this new program 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes implementation of the caa amendments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
solid waste 
the company generates non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the epa and the states in which the company operates are considering the adoption of stricter disposal standards for the type of non hazardous wastes generated by the company 
rcra also governs the generation  management  and disposal of hazardous wastes 
at present  the company is not required to comply with a substantial portion of the rcra requirements because the company s operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  it is anticipated that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during the company s operations  could in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal and management requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses by the company 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons in connection with the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner or operator of any site where a release historically occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
in the course of its ordinary operations  the company may have managed substances that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
the company may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites where the company disposed of or arranged for the disposal of these substances 
this potential liability extends to properties that the company owned or operated  as well as to properties owned and operated by others at which disposal of the company s hazardous substances occurred 
the company may also fall into the category of the current owner or operator 
the company currently owns or leases numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
although the company believes it has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released by the company on or under the properties owned or leased by the company 
in addition  many of these properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties who may have disposed of or released hydrocarbons or other wastes at these properties 
under cercla  and analogous state laws  the company could be subject to certain liabilities and obligations  such as being required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by its success in acquiring producing oil and natural gas properties 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices have also influenced the company s financial results 
relatively minor movements in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a change in the company s results of operations and cash flow and could have an impact on the company s borrowing base under the company s bank credit facility 
based on the operating results  a change in the average natural gas price realized by the company of per mcf would result in a change in net income attributable to common stock of approximately million  or per share on an as diluted basis

the company s annual capital expenditure activity is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands acquisition of oil and gas properties    other leasehold costs  workovers and recompletions    development drilling    exploratory drilling  other   total    the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary with no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company spent million  million and million on development and exploration activities in  and  respectively 
the company currently anticipates spending approximately million on development projects in and million for exploration projects in the company intends to primarily use internally generated cash flow to fund capital expenditures other than significant acquisitions 
the company anticipates that such sources will be sufficient to fund the expected development and exploration expenditures 
the company does not have a specific acquisition budget as a result of the unpredictability of the timing and size of forthcoming acquisition activities 
the company intends to use borrowings under the company s bank credit facility or other debt or equity financing to finance significant acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to the financial condition and performance of the company  and some of which will be beyond the company s control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
the company s bank credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment provided by a syndicate of ten banks for which the first national bank of chicago serves as agent 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the company s bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability which is generally redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of the company s oil and gas properties 
as of december   the borrowing base was million 
such borrowing base may be affected from time to time by the performance of the company s oil and natural gas properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the revolving credit line bears interest at the option of the company at either i libor plus to or ii the corporate base rate plus to  depending in each case on the utilization of the available borrowing base 
the company incurs a commitment fee of up to to per annum  depending on the utilization of the available borrowing base  on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
the average annual interest rate as of december   of all outstanding indebtedness under the company s bank credit facility was approximately 
the revolving credit line matures on december  or such earlier date as the company may elect 
the credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends  limit the amount of consolidated debt  and limit the company s ability to make certain loans and investments 
federal taxation at december   the company had federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the nol carryforwards expire from through the value of these carryforwards depends on the ability of the company to generate federal taxable income and to utilize the carryforwards to reduce such income 
inflation in recent years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations or financial condition
