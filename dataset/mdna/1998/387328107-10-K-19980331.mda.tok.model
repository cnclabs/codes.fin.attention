general granite is one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and is engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
the company has offices in california  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  oregon  maryland and utah 
the company s contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties 
the company s bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts to the company may vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from construction contracts including construction joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based upon costs incurred and projected costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contracts frequently extend over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided in total when determined  regardless of the degree of project completion 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized in the period when it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion  and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods 
the company s compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
thus  the company may experience an increase in general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and a decrease in less profitable years 
the company s pension contribution in excess of the k matching contributions is at the discretion of the board of directors based on the company reaching certain levels of profitability each year 
current year revenue and backlog 
during the year ended december   revenue increased million to billion 
the increase in revenue is associated with higher levels of bidding opportunities and awards in our branch division 
the branch division revenue increased million to million in  from million in heavy construction division hcd revenue decreased million to million in  from million in the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to million  or of the company s revenue in  from million  or in revenue from private sector contracts decreased million to million in  and decreased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in the company s backlog at december  was million  up million  or over the same period in backlog at december  includes the company s share of the i corridor reconstruction project in salt lake city  utah which was awarded in the first quarter of work on our million portion of the contract began during the second quarter of with completion for profit recognition not expected until mid management expects that approximately of the work in the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during the company believes its bidding opportunities in its major marketplaces remain strong see outlook 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased in to from in  due in part to an increase in revenue recognized for contracts that had not reached the completion threshold 
additionally  gross profit in reflects the absence of the san joaquin hills toll road project completed in late which carried a higher than average gross profit margin 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  incentive compensation  retirement plans  costs associated with the company s estimating and bidding activities  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenue in  to million  or of revenue in the increase reflects a higher level of costs to support the company s increased revenue and bidding activities and increased personnel to support the company s expansion into the south east marketplace 
other income expenses 
other income increased million to million in the increase was due an increase in the company s equity in the earnings of its affiliates partially offset by higher interest expense associated with higher debt levels and a decrease in gains on sales of property and equipment

outlook 
this outlook section contains forward looking statements which are made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  changes in the composition of applicable federal and state legislation appropriation committees  federal and state appropriation changes for infrastructure spending  the general state of the economy  competition and pricing pressures  state referendums and initiatives  and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
looking ahead  re authorization of the federal transportation bill  often referred to as the istea bill  is one of the most important issues facing granite and its industry in federal funding for needed repair and improvement of the nation s highway system expires may  if congress fails to take action by then  new federal funding for roads  bridges and transit programs will cease 
some states  such as california  are currently enjoying the fruits of a healthy state economy  and have surplus highway building funds that could potentially be used to bridge any gap created by the lack of a federal program  at least for the next fiscal year 
in most states  however  that is not the case  and the absence of federal highway funding could jeopardize many state highway projects in the short term 
we are very encouraged  however  by the action taken most recently by the us senate 
in previous communications with our shareholders  we had indicated that it appeared unlikely that any action on the highway bill would occur before the federal budget had been approved 
surprisingly  the senate passed a six year  billion istea re authorization bill in march  a increase over the previous authorization 
the leadership in the house has indicated that a companion bill will reach the floor by april the house version calls for increases in funding to billion and taking the highway trust funds off budget 
a vote on the increase is expected to take place during the week of march  taking the trust funds off budget provides a mechanism to ensure that the authorized funding is actually spent 
in previous years congress didn t always appropriate funds to the same level as authorized under the earlier istea 
if the house could pass its bill by april  it would greatly increase the chances of a final bill being passed and signed by president clinton near the may deadline 
at the state level  our attention remains focused on the june primary election and proposition  the so called contracting out initiative 
the measure seeks to codify and expand a legal decision that precludes the california department of transportation from contracting out to private companies for design services at times when the agency does not have the capacity internally to design highway projects 
if this initiative passes  it would decrease the throughput in the design process and offer contractors like granite fewer projects on which to bid 
we are pleased by the recent upswing in the private sector  especially in california 
according to the construction industry research board cirb private nonresidential building was the strongest construction sector in moreover  residential building  as measured by new units in building permits  was up at year end compared to the totals at december  another indicator of economic strength is job growth  and according to the cirb  non farm job growth increased an estimated in  up from a increase in despite a still growing economy and the limited number of construction workers  the labor market has been stable and labor costs have not accelerated 
we continue to expand our training and development efforts across the country to attract and retain talented employees at both engineer and craft levels 
we were very pleased with the return on our investment in tic holdings  inc 
the company had a very good year  and it enters with a strong backlog and some excellent bidding opportunities 
we were successful in teaming with tic and its subsidiary  western summit  on a large sewage treatment plant in atlanta and we continue to look for ways in which our two companies can pursue joint venture opportunities 
the size and the quality of the backlog that we take into provide granite with the opportunity to achieve continued success in the coming year 
we have some excellent bidding prospects this year to add to that backlog  including the billion alameda corridor project in southern california  several large highway projects in the southeastern us  and the san francisco bay area bridge retrofit projects 
we are pleased with the progress of the interstate project that we are building in joint venture in salt lake city  utah 
the project is somewhat ahead of schedule  and we now expect it will reach the completion threshold  at which granite recognizes earnings on a job  in the third  perhaps even the second quarter of  instead of the fourth quarter  as previously estimated 
based on strong economics in most of the regions in which it operates  our branch division  coming off the best year in its history  is expecting more of the same in the division is off to a good start  due largely to the boost it is getting from el nino related emergency storm repair projects 
in summary  we enter with a record backlog and have a number of exciting bidding opportunities in front of us 
we still have to execute the work  but based on the strength of our backlog  increased public works expenditures  and the emergence of the private sector  we feel very confident that we can continue to grow our revenue and our earnings at the pace we expect of ourselves and which our investors and other stakeholders have come to expect 
prior years revenue and backlog 
during the year ended december   revenue increased million to million due to higher levels of bidding opportunities and awards in our branch division and a full year of utah branch activity in the branch division revenue increased million to million in  from million in heavy construction division revenue decreased million to million in  from million in the company s revenue from private sector contracts increased million to million  and went from of total revenue in to of total revenue in revenue from public sector contracts decreased to million  or of the company s revenue in  from million  or in during the year ended december   revenue increased million to million 
the increase in revenue reflected a strong quality backlog  healthy turn business and the addition of the company s new branch in utah 
the company s backlog at december  was million  up million  or over the same period in gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million decrease from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased in to from in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in decreased to from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenue in  to million  or of revenue in the increase reflects a full year of utah branch activity as well as an approximately million increase to bad debt expense relating to one project 
general and administrative expenses increased million from primarily due to the addition of the utah branch and higher incentive compensation and retirement plan contributions 
other income expenses 
other income increased million to million in the increase was influenced by million of gain on sales of joint venture owned equipment which cannot be expected to be repeated in future years 
other income decreased million to million in liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    capital expenditures    working capital    during  cash provided from operations of million was primarily used to purchase million of property and equipment  to repay million of long term debt  to pay dividends of million and repurchase million of common stock 
changes in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflect normal variations in the cash flow on contracts and payables 
the company s practice has been to replace and replenish its equipment fleet with cash generated from operations 
cash purchases of property  plants and equipment increased million from to and million from to the increase in primarily reflected the company s purchase of the utah branch in during  the company increased its investment in tic holdings  inc by million to approximately from the investment in the investment was financed by borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
in march of  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase at management s discretion up to  shares of its own common stock on the open market 
future purchases are expected to be made using the company s own cash resources 
shares repurchased will be held in the corporate treasury and will be used to cover contributions to the current employee stock ownership plan or for other corporate purposes 
the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
the company anticipates that cash generated internally and amounts available under its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its capital and other requirements  including contributions to employee benefit plans  for the foreseeable future 
the company currently has access to funds under its revolving credit agreement which allow it to borrow up to million  of which million was available at december  impact of the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the issue arises if date sensitive software recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will not be required to materially modify or replace its software in response to the year issue 
the company has begun communications with its significant suppliers and large public and private sector customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issue 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies or public agencies with which the company does business will be timely converted  or that failure to convert by another company or public agency would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not believe that the cost of addressing the impact on its computer systems of the year issue will be material to its business  results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or capital resources 
subsequent events 
on january   the board of directors declared a special dividend of per share of common stock in addition to a per share quarterly dividend  payable on april  to stockholders of record as of march  the quarterly dividend represents a per share increase over the quarterly dividends paid in of per share
