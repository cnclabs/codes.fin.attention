item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the current status of the mcgaw agreement 
under the abbott agreement which extends to april  abbott also has rights to market certain clave products together with its own products 
the abbott agreement adopted fixed prices as of january  for sales by the company to abbott  which prices are expected to decrease in the future based on sales volumes 
b 
braun mcgaw and abbott purchase clave products packaged separately and in bulk for distribution in the hospital market and to certain homecare providers 
clave products purchased in bulk are assembled into b 
braun mcgaw and abbott s primary and secondary iv sets 
both b 
braun mcgaw and abbott purchase other clave products  which are sold as accessories 
the company currently has approximately independent distributors in the united states who employ approximately salespeople in the aggregate 
in addition  the company employs product specialists who support the company s distributors salespeople  calling on prospective customers  demonstrating products and supporting programs to train distributors and customers staffs in the use of the company s products 
distributors purchase and stock the company s products for resale to hospitals and home healthcare providers 
sales to b 
braun mcgaw of mcgaw protected needles and clave products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively 
sales to abbott accounted for approximately and of net sales in and  respectively 
several independent distributors accounted for more between and of net sales 
all other customers account for smaller percentages of net sales 
although the loss of one or more of the several larger distributors could have an adverse affect on the company s business  the company believes it could readily locate other distributors in the same territories who could continue to distribute the company s products to the same customers 
the loss of b 
braun mcgaw or abbott as a customer would be more significant because these customers have full line contracts with numerous hospitals and homecare providers to supply all iv products and solutions to those customers 
the company s products are distributed in several european countries  canada  the middle east  australia  japan and other parts of asia 
during   and  foreign sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into a distribution agreement with boc ohmeda ab ohmeda  a major distributor of medical products  for distribution of clave in europe 
since then  a number of other distribution agreements have been established in europe  and the company has placed two product specialists in italy 
the company has distribution throughout most of europe  and expects to add a number of additional product specialists in in january  ohmeda announced an agreement to sell its european distribution operations to a competitor of the company  the company is currently evaluating the impact of that 
there is no assurance that the sale will be completed and there is no assurance as to the impact of that sale on future distribution through ohmeda or whether it will have an adverse effect on the company s ability to increase sales in europe 
manufacturing manufacturing of the company s products involves injection molding of plastic parts  manual and automated assembly of the molded plastic parts  needles and other components  quality control inspection  packaging and sterilization 
the company molds the majority of its requirements for components  performs all assembly  quality control  inspection  packaging  labeling and shipping of its products 
sterilization and sterility testing are performed under contract by independent companies 
the company has a fully integrated medical device manufacturing facility in two adjacent buildings totaling  square feet in san clemente  california 
a mold maintenance shop supports the repair and maintenance needs of the company s molding operation 
in addition  the mold maintenance shop serves as a research and development prototype shop  and utilizes advanced computer assisted design systems and automated machining equipment 
the state of the art medical device molding facility includes an  square foot class  clean room in which all molding of the company s proprietary medical components is performed 
the clean room is equipped with injection molding machines and ancillary equipment including robots designed to minimize human intervention 
the company uses sophisticated  highly automated assembly systems to assemble the clave  clave integrated y site  click lock  rf and the mcgaw protected needle products 
the assembly systems are custom designed and manufactured for the company 
the piggy lock  lopez valve and iv sets are assembled manually 
the company s state of the art injection molding technology and highly automated assembly systems are designed to maintain a high level of product quality and achieve high volume production at low unit manufacturing costs 
to achieve these advantages and to gain greater control over raw material and finished product delivery times  the company now molds its entire requirements of proprietary molded components 
generic  off the shelf items are purchased from outside vendors unless significant cost savings can be achieved by molding in house 
the company is not dependent on any individual vendor for purchased parts and has no contracts with its suppliers beyond the terms of purchase orders issued 
the company s products are currently sterilized in processes  which use either gamma radiation or ethylene oxide gas eto 
most of the company s sterilization is by gamma radiation 
sterilization is performed by independent companies who have extensive equipment and procedures to prevent the release of eto and radiation into the environment 
use of eto in california is subject to hazardous material labeling requirements 
the company believes that it can continue to have its products sterilized by firms in california 
the company is also investigating other methods of sterilization that would be more cost effective and less time consuming  and has commenced qualification of certain products for sterilization by electronic beam radiation e beam 
e beam sterilization is less expensive and quicker than either of the other two methods currently used by the company 
government regulation government regulation is a significant factor in the development  marketing and manufacturing of the company s products 
the company and its products are regulated by the fda under a number of statutes including the federal food  drug and cosmetics act fdc act 
the fdc act provides two basic review procedures for medical devices 
certain products may qualify for a submission authorized by section k of the fdc act  under which the manufacturer gives the fda a pre market notification of the manufacturer s intention to commence marketing the product 
the manufacturer must  among other things  establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a letter finding substantial equivalence 
if a medical device does not qualify for the section k procedure  the manufacturer must file a pre market approval pma application 
this requires substantially more extensive pre filing testing than the section k procedure and involves a significantly longer fda review process 
fda approval of a pma application occurs only after the applicant has established safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda 
each of the company s current products has qualified  and the company anticipates that any new products that it is likely to market will qualify  for the expedited section k clearance procedure 
there is no assurance  however  that new products developed by the company or any manufacturers that the company might acquire  or claims that the company may make concerning those products  will qualify for expedited clearance rather than the more time consuming pma procedure or that  in any case  they will receive clearance from the fda 
as described under item  business  products  clc  certain product performance claims for the clc require fda approval 
that approval may be required pursuant to the pma procedure 
fda regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive 
uncertainties as to time required to obtain fda clearances or approvals could adversely affect the timing and expense of new product introductions 
all of the regulated products currently manufactured by the company are classified as class ii medical devices by the fda 
class ii medical devices are subject to performance standards relating to one or more aspects of the design  manufacturing  testing and performance or other characteristics of the product in addition to general controls involving compliance with labeling and record keeping requirements 
the company must comply with fda regulations governing medical device manufacturing practices 
the fda and the california department of health services dhs require manufacturers to register and subject them to periodic fda and dhs inspections of their manufacturing facilities 
the company is an fda registered medical device manufacturer  and must demonstrate that the company and its contract manufacturers comply with the fda s current quality system regulations qsr regulations 
under these regulations  the manufacturing process must be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures and the ability to produce devices which meet the manufacturer s specifications must be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every critical aspect of the process 
they also require investigation of any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced and detailed record keeping 
further  the fda s interpretation and enforcement of these requirements has been increasingly strict in recent years and seems likely to be even more stringent in the future 
failure to adhere to qsrs would cause the products produced to be considered in violation of the applicable law and subject to enforcement action 
the fda monitors compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the fda  and by subjecting them to periodic fda inspections of manufacturing facilities 
if the inspector observes conditions that might be violative  the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily  or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace 
the company believes that its products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable fda and dhs regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that other products under development by the company or products developed by the company in the future will be cleared by the fda and classified as class ii products  or that additional regulations restricting the sale of its present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the fda or dhs 
in addition  changes in fda  dhs or other federal or state health  environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect the company s business 
to market its products in the european community ec  the company must conform to additional requirements of the ec and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives 
as a manufacturer that designs  manufactures and markets its own devices  the company must comply with the quality management standards of en iso en 
those quality standards are similar to the gmp regulations but incorporate the quality requirements for product design and development 
manufacturers of medical devices must also be in conformance with ec directives such as council directive eec medical device directive and their applicable annexes 
those are regulations that assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the ec 
once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the medical device directive  the ce mark may be affixed to its devices 
the ce mark gives devices an unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the ec 
the company has demonstrated conformity to the regulations of both en iso en and the medical device directive and affixes the ce mark to its device labeling for product sold in member countries of the ec 
the company believes its products and systems are in compliance with all ec requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that other products under development by the company or products developed by the company in the future will be in conformance or that additional regulations restricting the sale of its present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the ec 
competition the market for iv products is intensely competitive 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends upon its continued product innovation  the quality  convenience and reliability of its products  access to distribution channels  patent protection  and pricing 
the company encounters significant competition in this market both from large established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies 
the company s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to differentiate the products based on safety features  product quality  cost effectiveness  ease of use and convenience  as well as the company s ability to perceive and respond to changing customer needs 
in the long term  the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to reduce unit manufacturing costs of the clave through higher volume production 
in addition to competing with conventional iv connection systems and protected needle locking iv connection systems marketed by companies such as baxter healthcare corporation baxter and abbott  the company s present and future products will compete with needleless iv connection systems like those marketed by baxter  b 
braun medical  inc  ivac corporation and others 
although the company believes that its needleless clave has distinct advantages over competing systems  there is no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully with these products 
manufacturers of products with which the company currently competes  or might compete in the future  include large companies with an established presence in the healthcare products market and substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution  managerial and other resources 
in particular  baxter  abbott and b 
braun mcgaw are leading distributors of iv therapy systems  while becton dickinson and company and sherwood medical company dominate the hypodermic needle market 
several of these competitors have broad product lines and have been successful in obtaining full line contracts with a significant number of hospitals to supply all of their iv product requirements 
in order to penetrate more of these hospitals  the company has established strategic supply and distribution relationships with b 
braun mcgaw and abbott 
the company believes the success of clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors  which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
the company is aware of a number of such products 
the company believes these products were developed primarily by companies who currently do not have the distribution or financial capabilities of the company 
the company believes these products have had a modest impact on its clave business to date  and there is no assurance that the company s current or future products will be able to successfully compete with these or future products developed by others 
patents the company has united states and certain foreign patents on the clave  click lock and piggy lock iv connectors and has united states patents on the lopez valve connector 
the company has applications pending for additional united states and foreign patents on the clc  clave  click lock and piggy lock iv connectors 
the expiration dates of the company s patents range from to the company s success may depend in part on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
while the company has obtained certain patents and applied for additional united states and foreign patents covering certain of its products  there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will prevent competitors from introducing similar devices or that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the company also believes that patents on the click lock and the lopez valve products may have been  and that patent protection on the clave may be  important in preventing others from introducing competing products which are as effective as the company s products 
the loss of patent protection on click lock  lopez valve or clave products could adversely affect the company s ability to exclude other manufacturers from producing effective competitive products and could have an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the fact that a patent is issued to the company does not eliminate the possibility that patents owned by others may contain claims which are infringed by the company s products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which would result in substantial cost to and diversion of resources by the company  may be necessary to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
in addition  enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights through litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in  the company initiated legal proceedings against tri state hospital supply corporation alleging patent infringement  the cost of the litigation has been significant 
see item  legal proceedings  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conduction and results of operations  and item  financial statements

through  both agreements established minimum transfer prices and a revenue sharing formula under which the company could receive more than the minimum transfer prices based on selling prices of products incorporating the company s products 
the mcgaw agreement provided for revenue sharing based on mcgaw s selling prices of clave products and the abbott agreement provided for revenue sharing based on abbott s selling prices of both clave products and rhinos 
effective august   and january   respectively  the abbott agreement was amended to establish fixed selling prices for rhinos and clave products and eliminate revenue sharing for all sales after the respective effective dates

braun mcgaw since june have decreased somewhat from the levels in the first half of  although they are still significantly above those for comparable periods of the prior year 
there is no assurance as to future patterns of sales with b 
braun mcgaw  and  while the company expects to conclude a definitive agreement with b 
braun mcgaw  there is no assurance that it will 
if it does not  the current agreement will remain in effect 
the company believes that as the healthcare provider market continues to consolidate  the company s success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on the company s ability  either independently or through strategic supply and distribution arrangements  to secure long term clave contracts with major buying organizations 
further  the company s marketing and distribution strategy may result in a significant share of the company s revenues being concentrated among a small number of customers 
the loss of a strategic supply and distribution agreement with a customer or the loss of a large contract by such a customer  could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
management believes the success of clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
the company is aware of a number of such products 
in response to competitive pressure felt in the third quarter of  the company in mid october announced to its independent distributors a new aggressive pricing strategy to protect and expand its market 
under this strategy  prices to independent distributors will eventually be reduced by up to approximately  depending on the type of customer to which the distributor is reselling the clave product 
the average price reduction through the fourth quarter of has been less than the maximum  although management expects that the average price of its clave products will continue to decline 
there is no assurance that the company s current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
comparison of to in  the company reported net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the most significant factor in the increase was a  or  increase in clave net sales  including revenue sharing from b 
braun mcgaw on sales of clave products 
net sales in all of the company s other product lines increased over  except for a decrease in click lock  piggy lock and mcgaw protected needle net sales 
the company s independent distributors accounted for of the company s net sales in  with mcgaw accounting for and abbott the remaining 
in  the comparable percentages were  and  respectively 
total clave net sales increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with mcgaw and abbott accounting for the entire unit growth 
unit sales to independent distributors were down slightly 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to mcgaw and abbott  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted by bulk  non sterile claves 
net sales to b 
braun mcgaw  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave net sales to b 
braun mcgaw increased approximately  principally because of an increase in unit shipments 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle declined and management expects those to continue to decline as the market for safe connectors continues its shift to needleless technology 
based on b 
braun mcgaw s forecasts  management expects increases in unit shipments to b 
braun mcgaw in  although there is no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
under the mcgaw agreement  the company receives revenue sharing payments on b 
braun mcgaw s sales of its safeline products  such payments commenced in  and the company recorded estimated revenue sharing of approximately  in  as compared with  in although management anticipates that such revenue sharing will continue  the actual amount will depend on the volume and selling prices of b 
braun mcgaw s safeline products  which management has no means of forecasting accurately 
net sales to abbott amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave sales were  an increase of from the  in the balance of the sales were in the low priced rhino  which were  as compared with  in management expects an increase in sales volume with abbott in  although there is no assurance that such increases will be realized 
management expects that unit sales of clave to its independent distributors in will be approximately the same as in or slightly lower 
although management had expected that the price reduction commenced in october would eventually be more that offset by increased volume  this has not occurred to date for independent distributors in the aggregate 
there is no assurance that independent distributors will achieve increased unit volume in the future 
further  the ability of the independent distributors to sustain their unit sales may be impacted by competition from existing and new competitive products or acquisition of clave market share by abbott and b 
braun mcgaw 
management expects to encounter continued pricing pressure from individual end users  and expects continued declines in net prices to the independent distributors 
net sales of click lock and piggy lock decreased in as compared to  because of the safe connector market s continued shift to needleless technology  and management expects that decline to continue 
the lopez valve showed a growth in net sales as compared to because of increased unit shipments 
management expects continued modest increases in lopez valve net sales in the company s budget medical products subsidiary bmp  which markets custom iv sets  recorded approximately  net sales in as compared to  in  its first year of operations 
most of the increase in net sales was because of increased unit shipments of custom iv sets incorporating the clave 
bmp s production is relatively labor intensive  resulting in a generally lower gross profit margin than for the company s other products 
bmp had a small gross profit in the company is currently taking steps aimed at expanding bmp by increasing systems capabilities  improving manufacturing efficiency  reducing labor cost and enhancing distribution 
as part of these steps  the company is evaluating transferring its manufacturing to a low labor cost area outside of the united states  as well as a significant broadening of its market 
there can be no assurance that these steps will achieve the desired results 
however  even if they are successful  management expects that gross profit margins in bmp will be lower than those historically recorded by the company because production of its products is relatively labor intensive 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into a distribution agreement with boc ohmeda ab ohmeda  a major distributor of medical products  for distribution of clave in europe 
since then  a number of other distribution agreements have been established in europe  and the company has located two product specialists in italy 
the company has distribution throughout most of europe  and expects to add a number of additional product specialists in total sales to foreign distributors were  in as compared to  in management expects that its sales to foreign distributors will continue to increase in the future 
in january  ohmeda announced an agreement to sell its european distribution operations to a competitor of the company  the company is currently evaluating the impact of that 
there is no assurance that the sale will be completed and there is no assurance as to the impact of that sale on future distribution through ohmeda or whether it will have an adverse effect on the company s ability to increase sales in europe 
gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the shift in sales mix toward a higher percentage of the relatively higher margin clave products  continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive production automation  and the mcgaw safeline revenue sharing first recorded in more than offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
the company expects that its unit production costs will continue to decrease in as unit volumes increase  but that the gross margin percentage will stay at or slightly lower than that achieved in as average unit sales prices decrease 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by approximately  to  in  as compared to  in as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in and in the increase in sg a costs was primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the company s domestic expansion of the clave product line  growth of bmp and expansion of the international sales efforts 
an increase in corporate expenses also contributed to the increase in sg a 
partially offsetting those increases was a decrease in the costs of patent litigation in which the company is the plaintiff from  in to  in management also expects sg a costs  exclusive of the patent litigation costs  to increase in  both in absolute terms and also slightly as a percentage of sales  because of growth in the company  increased domestic and international sales and marketing costs  promotional costs of new products expected to be introduced and expansion of bmp 
management expects the patent litigation costs to increase somewhat from the level experienced in  but the amount and timing of the costs will depend on the progress of the litigation  and no assurances can be given in this regard 
research and development r d costs increased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  as compared with approximately  or of sales  in the increase related to efforts to complete development on a number of new products 
management estimates that r d costs in will continue at a higher level than in because of continuing efforts to complete new products and because of clinical evaluations of the new clc  including trials necessary for fda clearance of certain performance claims for the clc however  no assurance can be given that such costs will not differ from those estimates or that the r d will be completed as expected 
the operating margin increased to in  compared with in  principally because sg a decreased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income was essentially unchanged from to the company s effective income tax rate in was as compared with in  principally because tax exempt investment income decreased as a percentage of total taxable income 
management expects its effective tax rate in to be equal to or slightly higher than the rate 
income from operations increased  as the increase in operating expenses of trailed the increase in net sales and gross profit 
on a percentage basis  that increase in income from operations was partially offset by the essentially unchanged income from investments and a higher effective tax rate  resulting in a overall increase in net income 
net income per share increased  or due to the increase in net income  and the reduction in shares outstanding because of the purchase of shares for treasury 
the acquisition of treasury stock after considering the investment income that would have been earned if the shares had not been purchased  increased earnings per share by approximately for the year comparison of to in  the company reported net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to a  or  increase in clave sales  including revenue sharing from mcgaw on sales of clave products  and  of revenue sharing on mcgaw s sales of its safeline products  which payments were initiated also contributing to the increase were sales by the company s budget medical products subsidiary formed in late  sales of the low priced rhino and a modest increase in lopez valve sales 
those increases were partially offset by a decrease in click lock and piggy lock sales and a decrease in mcgaw protected needle sales 
the company s independent distributors accounted for of the company s net sales in  with mcgaw accounting for and abbott the remaining 
in  the comparable percentages were  and  respectively 
total clave net sales increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with independent distributors  mcgaw and abbott accounting for approximately  and  respectively  of this unit growth 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects equally lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to mcgaw and abbott 
net sales to mcgaw  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave sales to mcgaw increased approximately  principally because of an increase in unit shipments 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle declined

gross margin for improved to from the registered in the shift in sales mix toward a higher percentage of the relatively higher margin clave products  continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive production automation  and the mcgaw safeline revenue sharing first recorded in more than offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by approximately  to  in  as compared to  in as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in and in the increase was primarily due to the continuing costs of patent litigation in which the company is the plaintiff  such costs were  in and  in see item  legal proceedings 
other sg a expenses increased at a somewhat lower rate than the increases in sales except for those related to bmp  which were not incurred in research and development r d costs increased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  as compared with approximately  or less than of sales  in the increase accelerated during the year as the company increased efforts to complete development on a number of new products 
the operating margin decreased slightly in compared with  from to 
the effects of the improved gross profit was more than offset by the patent litigation costs and higher r d costs 
investment income increased in to  from  in because of increased funds invested 
funds increased because of the net proceeds of approximately  from the company s july public offering of common stock and cash provided by operations 
the company s effective income tax rate in was as compared with in a state manufacturing tax credit  recorded in the fourth quarter of both years  was lower in than in  and that effect was partially offset by a higher portion of income being tax exempt investment income in net income increased because of higher sales and gross profit margins offset by higher rates of sg a and r d in relation to sales 
net income per share increased due to the increase in net income  offset by the effect of additional shares issued in the public offering in july liquidity and capital resources during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased to  from  those increases were due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities offset by  used to acquire treasury stock
