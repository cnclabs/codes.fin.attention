fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal  as compared to net income of million  or per share  in fiscal  due primarily to the million non cash charge discussed above 
sales of homes and land including unconsolidated joint ventures were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease is due to a decrease in total home closings from  in fiscal to in fiscal  including and homes  respectively  closed in unconsolidated joint ventures 
as an offset to the decreased closing activity  the company s average sales price per unit has increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a increase 
the decrease in closings and the resultant decrease in sales was primarily due to the effect  prior to the restructuring discussed above  of constraints in both the bank lines and bond indenture which limited construction starts and sale releases in the past several quarters 
in addition  the level of closings was negatively impacted by the unusually wet winter in california precipitated by the el nino weather phenomenon 
due primarily to the non cash charge of million  the company s actual gross margin on home and lot closings decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal however  the company s pro forma gross margin on home and lot closings improved to during fiscal as compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense of million for fiscal decreased million or as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from in fiscal to for this relationship is impacted positively by the company s ongoing cost containment efforts and adversely by the effect of lower revenues during fiscal income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to both the higher unit closings and higher margins experienced in the company s current joint ventures 
interest and other income increased from  to  primarily as a result of increased activity in the company s mortgage broker operations 
minority interest of  for fiscal primarily represents the share of the new llc s income attributable to chf since october  interest incurred was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  while interest included in cost of sales was million during fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the company has recorded a net income tax benefit of  for fiscal reflecting the generation of a deferred income tax benefit during the year offset by current income taxes payable 
fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  the company recorded net income of million in fiscal or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  for fiscal these results were due to the factors described below 
sales of homes and land including unconsolidated joint ventures were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal revenues from housing sales for fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal year  the revenues figures for housing sales for fiscal and fiscal do not include closings from the unconsolidated joint ventures 
this revenue increase was due to an increase in the average sales price during the fiscal year 
home closings for fiscal were  which includes homes closed in unconsolidated joint ventures compared to  homes which includes homes closed in unconsolidated joint ventures for fiscal  a decrease of homes which  nevertheless  resulted in an increase in total revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year of million increased million over fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increased number of projects being marketed in california and texas 
minority interest for fiscal of  decreased  from fiscal this decrease was due to a reduced number of consolidated joint venture home closings in fiscal year for fiscal  consolidated joint venture closings totaled units versus the units closed in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash requirements are for the acquisition  development  construction  marketing and overhead of its projects 
the need to stage the acquisition and use of raw materials such as land and finished lots and the need  on certain projects  to construct community facilities ahead of the start of home construction requires homebuilders such as the company to commit working capital for longer periods than many traditional manufacturing companies 
when building inventory  the company uses substantial amounts of cash that are generally obtained from borrowings  available cash flow from operations and partners contributions to joint ventures 
at the current time  all material financing transactions and arrangements are incurred either by cph llc or by certain newly formed project specific entities 
as of february   cph llc has in place several credit facilities totaling million the facilities with various bank lenders the banks  of which million was outstanding 
the facilities are secured by liens on various completed or under construction homes and lots held by cph llc 
pursuant to the facilities  cph llc is subject to certain covenants  which require  among other things  the maintenance of a consolidated liabilities to net worth ratio  minimum liquidity  minimum net worth and loss limitations  all as defined in the documents that evidence the facilities 
at february   cph llc was in compliance with these covenants 
the facilities also define certain events that constitute events of default 
as of february   no such event had occurred 
commitment fees are payable annually on some of the facilities 
homebuilding activity is being financed out of cph llc cash  bank financing  and the existing joint ventures  including joint ventures with institutional investors  including chf  the investor in cph llc 
the company anticipates that it will continue to utilize both third party financing and joint ventures to cover financing needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
in may  the company completed the sale of million of senior notes including  warrants to purchase common stock 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay certain debt of the company  acquire certain properties and for general working capital and construction purposes 
the proceeds are projected to provide sufficient available liquidity  when combined with additional financing permitted under the indenture  joint ventures and cash flow from operations  to fund the cph llc s current and projected acquisition  development and construction activities 
the obligations associated with the senior notes have been transferred from the company to cph llc 
the indenture contains restrictions on the incurring of indebtedness which affect the availability of these bank facilities based on various measures of the financial performance of the cph llc 
subject to such restrictions  the bank facilities will be available to augment cash flow from operations and joint venture financing to fund the cph llc s operations 
management expects that cash flow generated from operations and from additional financing permitted by the terms of the indenture will be sufficient to cover the debt service and to fund cph llc s current development and homebuilding activities for the reasonably foreseeable future 
interest rates and inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land prices  land development  construction and overhead costs balanced by increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of construction costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as materials and other costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to duplicate its past ability to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home 
asset impairment charges in connection with the restructuring and recapitalization of the company discussed above  management completed a process of reevaluating and revising the company s business plan  including its plans for the development of its various projects 
as a result of this analysis  it was determined that certain of the company s projects would require an impairment charge when evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  management determined that certain warranty related reserves should be adjusted 
therefore  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge of million 
operating results during fiscal year were adversely affected by asset impairment charges totaling million related to the write off of operational start up costs for the company s operations in arizona  the write off of certain redesign and materials costs previously capitalized to certain low margin projects in nevada and the write off of certain other costs 
year compliance the company has assessed the vulnerability of its computer systems to the year issue and the cost of addressing year compliance 
modifications and replacements of computer systems  primarily the replacement of computer software  to attain year compliance have begun  and the company expects to attain year compliance and institute appropriate testing of its modifications and replacements before the year date change 
presently  the company does not believe that year compliance will result in material expenditures by the company  nor does the company anticipate the year issue will have direct material adverse effects on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the year issue will not adversely affect the company and its business  including through an adverse effect on general economic conditions

both fas and are required to be adopted by the company for the year ended february  the company believes the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
