revenue vs 
consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million or percent from million in the increase in reflected higher product sales and a slight increase in service revenue 
each of the company s product classes experienced sales growth in  except for the company s imaging and inspection systems 
this product class was sold in march consolidated revenue was also bolstered by acquisitions in gerber technology s gt cutting edge 
registered trademark  an acquisition in last year s fourth quarter  and coburn optical industries  inc  an acquisition in this year s fourth quarter  incrementally added million and million in sales  respectively 
the largest increases in product sales occurred in the company s line of computer controlled pre production  design  manufacturing  spreading  and unit production systems for the apparel and flexible goods industries 
the most significant increases within this product class were from gerbercutter 
registered trademark 
fabric cutting systems and fabric spreading systems  both in the us and european markets 
also contributing were higher sales of related software products  including a product data management system that provides a powerful tool for developing product specifications  controlling and managing data  and documenting the product development process  production  and quality requirements 
product sales also increased in from sales of the company s lens edge finishing systems to both the optical superstore chains and the wholesale optical laboratories 
the company continued to benefit from higher demand in these markets for its complete lab system 
another developing segment was the independent eyewear practitioner market ophthalmologists  optometrists  and opticians 
sales to this market  as well as sales to the wholesale optical laboratories  were generated from the company s strategic distribution alliance with a major  vertically integrated lens manufacturer 
higher sales of the company s aftermarket supplies for the sign making and specialty graphics product class also contributed to the sales increase 
demand for consumables for the gerber edge  a digital imaging system for color printing directly on sign vinyl  was the principal factor 
the decrease in the imaging and inspection systems product class was caused by lower shipments of computer to plate imaging systems for the commercial printing industry and the inclusion of less than a full year s results eleven months in the company s consolidated results of operations  and was partially offset by higher shipments of oem supplied equipment for the electronics industry 
on a geographic basis  sales gains were realized in in each of the company s major geographic markets us  europe  far east  and other international 
most notably  export sales to european customers improved significantly  up million from the previous year to million 
this increase was the continuation of a stronger shipment trend that started in the prior year s second half 
export sales to latin american markets were million  up million from the prior year  largely due to an increase in demand for the company s ophthalmic lens manufacturing systems 
export sales to the far east were million  up million from the prior year  due principally to an increase in demand for the company s computer controlled pre production  design  manufacturing  spreading  and unit production systems for the apparel and flexible materials industries 
in total  export sales from the united states in were million  percent higher than the prior year  and represented percent of total revenue compared with percent in both and revenue vs 
consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million or percent from million in the increase in reflected higher product sales and a slight increase in service revenue 
each of the company s product classes experienced sales growth in  except for the company s line of computer controlled cutting  nesting  spreading  and material handling systems 
the decrease in this product class was caused by the relative weakness in demand from the apparel industry for fabric cutting systems  which occurred in the first half of the year 
the largest increase in product sales occurred in imaging systems as the company attempted to penetrate the commercial printing industry with computer to plate digital imaging systems 
increased sales of the company s sign making systems and aftermarket supplies also contributed to the sales increase 
the sales increase was fueled by the introduction of two new high speed sign making routers and strong demand for aftermarket supplies  especially consumables for the gerber edge 
product sales gains were also realized in from sales of the company s optical lens manufacturing systems to both the optical superstore chains and the wholesale optical laboratories 
the opening of new retail stores  as well as the conversion of existing stores  led to higher demand for the company s complete lab system 
market consolidation and the company s initial strategic distribution alliance with a major  vertically integrated lens manufacturer contributed to higher sales to the wholesale optical laboratories 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the company experienced stronger demand  especially from the united states and certain international markets  for its line of computer controlled cutting  nesting  spreading  and material handling systems for the apparel and related industries 
also contributing were higher sales of related software products  including a product data management system 
slightly affecting comparative sales was the company s acquisition of cutting edge  inc cutting edge in february  which added million to fourth quarter and annual revenue 
gt cutting edge manufactures high performance single layer fabric cutting systems for the industrial fabric  automotive  furniture  apparel  and composite materials industries

export sales to far east customers improved significantly  up million from the previous year to million 
all of the company s product classes had increased sales in the far east in compared with also  export sales to latin america and canada were up million and million  respectively 
the increase in latin american exports was largely a result of increased demand for the company s computer controlled pre production  design  manufacturing  spreading and unit production systems for the apparel and flexible materials industries 
the increase in canadian exports was largely due to increased demand for the company s interactive imaging and inspection systems for the printed circuit board and graphic arts industries

increased sales of the company s computer to plate digital imaging systems for the commercial printing and graphic arts industries also contributed to the sales increase 
product sales gains were also realized in in optical lens manufacturing systems and in the company s line of marker making and fabric spreading systems for the apparel and allied industries 
gross margins the overall gross profit margin in was percent compared with percent in this increase reflected higher margins on product sales  which were partially offset by lower service margins 
the gross profit margin on product sales was percent in compared with percent in favorable volume effects from higher shipments of fabric cutting systems  especially in north american markets  was a primary reason for the improvement 
this was partially offset by higher sales of oem supplied equipment for the electronics industry and also by price discounting on computer to plate imaging systems for the commercial printing market 
service gross profit margins decreased in to percent from percent in the reduction in service margins was caused by costs in associated with development of an applications training revenue stream from the computer to plate systems business 
the overall gross profit margin in was percent compared with percent in this reflected lower margins on product sales partially offset by higher service margins 
the gross profit margin on product sales was percent in compared with percent in contributing to the lower product gross margin in were higher sales of oem supplied equipment  particularly for the electronics industry  and price discounting on newly introduced computer to plate digital imaging systems in support of efforts to penetrate the commercial printing market 
product gross margins were also pressured by price discounting on sales of cutting and marker making systems to the apparel industry  especially in the european market 
service gross profit margins increased in to percent from percent in the improvement in service gross profit margins resulted  in part  from the utilization of service personnel on a product retrofit program 
the gross profit margins on product sales in were higher than in while margins on service revenue declined slightly 
the improvement in product margins reflected the favorable impact of higher sales volume in  although product margins were pressured by price discounting on sales of cutting and marker making systems to the apparel industry

selling  general and administrative expenses excluding a non recurring special charge in  selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses were million percent of revenue  which compared with million percent of revenue in and million percent of revenue in the higher s  g a expenses in each year related primarily to the higher sales volume 
significant marketing expenses associated with the introduction of computer to plate imaging systems for the commercial printing and graphic arts industries affected   and s  g a expenses 
the increased expenses in were also caused by higher marketing expenses associated with major trade shows  the inclusion of the first full year of gt cutting edge expenses  and the inclusion of two months of coburn expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was the effect of a cost reduction program implemented at the company s gerber technology subsidiary 
research and development expenses the company has historically committed significant resources to research and the development of new products and strives to maintain a leading position in automation technology in the various markets it serves 
research and development r d expenses represented percent of revenue in compared with percent and percent of revenue in and  respectively 
although r d expenses increased from the prior year  the percentage of r d expenses to revenue was lower this year 
the dollar increase related to increased development of new microprocessor and pc controlled sign making and graphic arts systems million  ophthalmic lens manufacturing systems million  and the inclusion of the expenses of gt cutting edge million 
partially offsetting these were decreased development expenses for interactive imaging and inspection systems million 
r d expenses in were higher than in due largely to the increased development of new interactive imaging and inspection systems million 
also contributing to higher r d levels in were the development of new sign making plotters million and new windows based software products for the company s optical lens manufacturing systems million 
the company s r d to revenue percentage will decline in fiscal year with the acquisition of spandex 
spandex  which had revenue of approximately million in its last reported year ended december   is principally a distribution company and has insignificant research and development activities 
non recurring special charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a million pre tax charge related to the write down of certain assets of the company s gerber systems unit 
gerber systems comprised the company s imaging and inspection systems product class  which was sold to the barco group of belgium as of march  for million in cash plus contingent future royalties based on the sales of certain products

offsetting the statutory us federal income tax rate were research and development tax credits reinstated through legislation in  tax exempt interest income from the company s municipal bond investments  and the tax savings derived from the company s foreign sales corporation fsc 
each of these items impacted the effective income tax rate to a greater degree in because of the reduction in pre tax income from the non recurring special charge 
additionally  the tax exempt life insurance benefit noted above reduced the effective tax rate in the temporary expiration of the research and development tax credit in contributed to the higher tax rate in that year
