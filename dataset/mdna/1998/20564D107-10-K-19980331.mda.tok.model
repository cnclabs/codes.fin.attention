item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of operations consolidated operations during the second quarter of  the corporation began accounting for the operations of both ascent entertainment group  inc ascent and substantially all of comsat rsi  inc crsi as discontinued operations 
the consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the results of operations and net assets of ascent and crsi as discontinued operations 
continuing operations consolidated revenues from continuing operations in were million  million higher than the previous year 
this improvement was the result of a increase in network services segment revenues which was  in part  offset by a decrease in satellite services segment revenues 
consolidated revenues for were million  an increase of million as compared to network services segment revenues in were higher than  while satellite services revenues were slightly below the previous year 
operating income from continuing operations for was million  as compared to million for the lower operating income was primarily the result of lower operating income in the satellite services segment and a larger operating loss in the network services segment 
the decrease in the satellite services segment was primarily the result of a lower investment base in comsat world systems cws upon which the regulated rate of return is calculated and increased depreciation from new satellites in comsat mobile communications cmc 
the increased loss in the network services segment resulted from the positive impact in from a licensing agreement that resolved patent infringement disputes with certain manufacturers of television encryption and decryption equipment at comsat laboratories which did not reoccur in also affecting operating income were expenses of million for a proxy contest and related litigation brought to enforce certain provisions of the communications satellite act of  which were settled in the second quarter of operating income in was million  million below other income expense for was a net expense of million  million lower than this was primarily attributable to improvements in the results of comsat international s ci equity investments 
other income expense for was a net expense of million  million higher than this was due to a full year of dividend payments in on the monthly income preferred securities mips  which were issued in july see note to the financial statements  offset by a million gain on the sale of ico global communications holdings limited ico shares 
see note to the financial statements 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized for  was million  million higher than the increase primarily reflects reduced interest capitalized due to the completion of several satellite projects 
for  interest expense net of amounts capitalized was million  million below the previous year 
this improvement was the result of lower interest expense  offset by a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized 
in  the corporation sold its clarksburg  maryland property and recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the land 
see note to the financial statements 
the consolidated tax rate on income from continuing operations before taxes and the extraordinary item for has improved over s effective tax rate principally because of a reduction in state income tax expense 
income from continuing operations before extraordinary item for was million  million below last year 
income for from continuing operations before extraordinary item was million  million below basic earnings per share for continuing operations for were  below for  basic earnings per share were  as compared to for diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for were  a decrease from diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for and were and  respectively

extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt  net of tax  for was million per share 
this represents the costs incurred in from the corporation s repurchase of million of its notes and million of its medium term notes 
see note to the financial statements 
discontinued operations the loss in from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million per share  fully diluted compared to losses of million per share for and million per share for discontinued operations include the operations of both ascent and substantially all of crsi 
comsat began accounting for substantially all of crsi as a discontinued operation on june  during the fourth quarter  the corporation recognized an additional charge to discontinued operations of million  after tax  related to the sale of crsi 
this additional charge is primarily attributable to losses now anticipated on the sale of crsi as well as adjustments in the estimated cost to complete certain long term contracts 
the total loss in discontinued operations for crsi for was million  after tax 
see note to the financial statements and management s discussion and analysis outlook 
comsat began accounting for ascent as a discontinued operation on may   when comsat s board of directors decided to distribute the corporation s interest in ascent to comsat s shareholders 
on june   comsat completed the spinoff of ascent as a tax free dividend to comsat s shareholders 
the loss from discontinued operations for ascent was million  net of tax 
see note to the financial statements 
consolidated results on a consolidated basis  including discontinued operations and the extraordinary item  the net loss for was million versus net income of million

segment operating results the corporation has reported operating results in two segments satellite services and network services see note to the financial statements 
the satellite services segment includes both comsat world systems cws and comsat mobile communications cmc 
the network services segment includes comsat international ci  comsat laboratories and government programs 
comsat laboratories and government programs results now include certain non manufacturing  telecommunications contracts and businesses that were previously reported as part of crsi 
in millions revenues satellite services world systems mobile communications total satellite services network services international laboratories government programs total network services eliminations and other total operating income loss satellite services world systems mobile communications total satellite services network services international laboratories government programs total network services total segment operating income provision for restructuring general and administrative expense other total satellite services satellite services includes the federal communications commission fcc regulated and non regulated businesses of cws and cmc 
cws provides international voice  data  video and audio communications as the statutorily designated us participant in the global satellite system of the international telecommunications satellite organization intelsat 
cmc provides maritime  aeronautical and land mobile communications services as the statutorily designated us participant in the global satellite system of the international mobile satellite organization inmarsat 
revenues in the satellite services segment in were million  below last year 
revenues in were million  million below operating income in the satellite services segment in was million  a decline of million as compared to operating income in was million  million below the previous year 
cws revenues for were million  below increased revenues from very small aperture terminal vsat leases and international business service ibs traffic were offset by contracted reductions in full time voice revenues and lower fiber optic cable restoration revenues 
the lower voice revenues stemmed primarily from scheduled rate reductions in long term carrier contracts with at t  mci and sprint  cws s three largest international carrier customers 
cws s revenues were million  which reflects a increase over the improvement in revenues came primarily from increases in vsat leases  ibs traffic and cws s share of revenues from the intelsat system 
these increases were partially offset by reduced revenues from scheduled rate reductions in long term carrier contracts 
operating income for cws in was million  below last year 
the results reflect increased depreciation from placing in service three intelsat satellites during the past months  offset in part by improved earnings realized on carrier to carrier contracts and the recovery of certain litigation costs 
operating income in in cws was million  a decrease from the prior year 
the decline in operating income was the result of a lower investment base upon which the regulated rate of return is calculated 
this was the result of insurance proceeds received from the february launch failure of the intelsat satellite 
see note to the financial statements 
revenues in cmc for were million  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the higher revenues were primarily the result of sales of planet terminals and service  and increases in cmc s share of revenues from the inmarsat system 
offsetting this increase in revenues were decreases in analog telephone transmissions and lower volume in the bulk service contract with idb mobile communications idb 
cmc s revenues were million  a decrease of as compared to the lower revenues were primarily the result of decreases in analog telephone and telex revenues  expiration of the american mobile satellite corporation amsc service contract in december and lower volume in the bulk service contract with idb 
cmc s operating income for was million  million below the decrease was primarily the result of increased depreciation associated with two inmarsat satellites placed in service during  and lower revenues and increased costs related to planet service  which began commercial operation in operating income in cmc for was million  or lower than due to lower revenues  increased depreciation expense associated with two inmarsat satellites placed in service during and increased costs related to the start up of planet service 
network services network services includes ci  comsat laboratories and government programs 
ci operates an integrated group of telecommunications businesses in countries with rapidly growing telecommunications markets and provides individualized digital network solutions to customers located in these markets 
comsat laboratories consists of two main businesses technical consulting and communications products 
government programs includes the commercial satellite communications initiative csci contract  satellite control facility and special program office 
network services segment revenues in were million  million  or higher than included in revenues and operating income during was million related to a licensing agreement that resolved patent infringement disputes with certain manufacturers of television encryption and decryption equipment at comsat laboratories 
revenues for the network services segment in were million  a improvement over the network services segment operating loss was million  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
the loss was lower primarily due to the positive impact of the licensing agreement noted above 
the operating loss in was million lower than ci s revenues in and were million and million  respectively  better than each of their comparative years 
the increase in revenues in ci was driven primarily by improvements in ci s operations in brazil  argentina and venezuela 
partially offsetting the increase in as compared to was a decline in revenues in belcom  ci s company operating in russia and in the newly independent states nis 
ci s operating loss in was million  million lower than the improvement was primarily the result of a decrease in losses at belcom 
revenue commitments under long term contracts increased to million at december   as compared to million at the end of ci s operating loss in was million  less than the previous year s loss of million 
this improvement was primarily the result of the increase in revenues in brazil and a decrease in the operating losses at belcom 
partially offsetting these improvements were start up costs associated with ci s newer companies in china  colombia and venezuela 
in may  ci acquired full ownership of the mexican corporation intelcom red sa de sa  which was previously a wholly owned subsidiary of icg satellite services  inc  and renamed it comsat mexico sa de sa comsat mexico 
comsat mexico offers business customers digital  domestic and international private line services to support voice  data and image applications 
in january  ci sold its remaining interest in philippine global communications  inc philcom at book value for million 
see notes and to the financial statements 
comsat laboratories revenues for were million  as compared to million for exclusive of the million of revenues related to the agreement that resolved patent disputes  comsat laboratories revenues were at approximately the same level as  and revenues were higher than the operating loss for comsat laboratories for was million  compared to operating income of million for exclusive of the income related to the agreement on patent disputes  the operating loss was million more than  and the operating loss was million lower than the laboratories backlog at december   was million  higher than at the end of government programs revenues in were million  an increase of million over the previous year 
the increased revenues were related to the csci contract and were offset by lower revenues from two marisat satellites that ceased operating in after years of service 
revenues in government programs in were million  million higher than this increase was primarily due to increased revenues associated with the csci contract  which started in the fourth quarter of the operating loss for government programs in was  compared to operating income of million for this was the result of lower revenues from the loss of the marisat satellites and increased costs associated with the csci contract 
government programs operating income was million below outlook many of the statements that follow are forward looking and relate to anticipated future events and operating results 
statements that look forward in time are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which may be affected by subsequent developments and business conditions  and necessarily involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements and the corporation s future operating results may be affected by the timing and outcome of pending regulatory and legislative actions  including the corporation s petition before the fcc for classification as a non dominant carrier and a bill introduced in congress which calls for the privatization of intelsat and inmarsat  efforts to restructure intelsat and inmarsat  competitive business conditions  the disposition of discontinued operations  and other factors 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual future results will not differ materially from anticipated results 
although the corporation has attempted to identify some of the important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  those factors should not be viewed as the only factors which may affect future operating results 
in march  comsat s board of directors approved a strategic plan to refocus the corporation on international satellite services and digital networking services and technology as discussed in the corporation s annual report on form k 
as a part of the strategic plan  the corporation decided to divest its ownership interest in ascent and sell substantially all of the assets and operations of crsi as well as other non core assets 
on june   the corporation distributed its ownership interest in ascent to its shareholders through a tax free dividend 
in march  the corporation signed a stock purchase agreement to sell substantially all of crsi for million 
the sale price is subject to adjustment based on inter company loans and advances between comsat and crsi at the time of the closing 
closing for the sale is expected to occur on or before june   and is dependent upon completion of certain conditions agreed to by the parties  third party consents and regulatory filings 
the financial impact of the transaction was included in the corporation s loss from discontinued operations 
as part of the agreement  the corporation is retaining electromechanical systems  inc and plexsys international corporation  pending evaluation of available alternatives 
comsat also will retain and complete a long term construction contract for a radio telescope in green bank  west virginia 
jefa wireless systems  a wholly owned subsidiary  was disposed of in a separate transaction in february the corporation s operating income from continuing operations is expected to be better than  while the net income from continuing operations is expected to be at approximately the same level as following is a discussion of comsat s two business segments 
satellite services in the first quarter of  continued progress was made in the corporation s ongoing efforts to restructure intelsat and inmarsat 
the intelsat board of governors and an internal working group have approved a restructuring plan that involves creation of a separate entity referred to as inc to which six satellites would be transferred 
an assembly of parties meeting of governments is now scheduled for march at which final approval for an overall restructuring plan is to be considered 
assuming that schedule is maintained  inc would be formally established as a separate business entity in the second quarter of  and an initial public offering for inc would be expected to occur sometime during the first half of the restructuring plan to be considered by the assembly of parties includes recommendations on several key issues  including inc s ownership structure and competitive safeguards 
as currently proposed  intelsat s direct ownership in inc would be limited to  and individual ownership levels would be limited to 
the proposal  however  would grandfather the corporation s direct ownership in inc pending completion of the initial public offering to the extent that the corporation s direct ownership would exceed the limit ultimately established 
at its march meeting  the inmarsat council approved a plan to transfer the operating assets of the current inmarsat intergovernmental organization to a new company 
the council will present its proposed plan to the inmarsat assembly of parties for consideration at a meeting now scheduled for april under the proposal  the target date for completing the transition to a private company is january  while the new company initially would not be publicly traded  it is expected that the company would proceed with an initial public offering within months after its creation 
as currently proposed  individual ownership in the new company would be capped at  although comsat s current ownership in inmarsat would be grandfathered 
prior to the public offering  owners would be able to trade shares  and strategic investors would be able to invest up to million in equity in the new company 
approval of the restructuring proposals under consideration at intelsat and inmarsat will require a vote of two thirds of the member governments that are present and voting up to in the case of intelsat and in the case of inmarsat  with each having one vote at the assembly of parties at which approval is sought 
the inmarsat restructure timetable is contingent on inmarsat member governments reaching broad consensus on implementing the proposed amendments to the inmarsat convention prior to formal ratification 
if such consensus is not achieved  the ratification process could take longer 
the corporation  as a minority shareholder and the us signatory to both organizations  lacks the ability to independently effect a restructuring of either intelsat or inmarsat 
the success and timing of the corporation s privatization efforts will be dependent upon the corporation s ability to achieve a consensus among other signatories and participating member governments 
in april  the corporation petitioned the fcc for classification as a non dominant carrier and for regulatory forbearance 
the petition requests that limits on the company s rate of return and structural separation requirements be removed and that cws be allowed to change its tariff rates and introduce new services over the intelsat satellite system on one day notice 
the petition has been opposed by certain of the corporation s competitors and customers 
the corporation expects that the fcc will act on the petition in  but cannot predict with accuracy the outcome and timing of fcc regulatory action nor whether the fcc may impose conditions on a grant of the corporation s petition  such as allowing customers some form of direct access to the intelsat system  abrogating certain provisions of the corporation s inter carrier agreements with its largest carrier customers  or requiring the corporation to waive its privileges and immunities as a intelsat signatory 
the us house of representatives commerce committee has approved a bill entitled the communications satellite competition and privatization act of hr over strong bipartisan opposition for consideration by the house of representatives 
to become law  the bill will have to be approved by the full house  considered and passed by the us senate and signed by the president 
while the corporation supports the bill s stated objective of privatizing intelsat and inmarsat in a pro competitive manner  comsat is strongly opposed to the bill as proposed  since it would have an extremely punitive effect on comsat and its shareholders 
however  the bill is in an early stage of the legislative process  and the corporation expects that the objectionable provisions of the bill will be addressed and resolved in the later stages of the process 
as proposed  hr could restrict comsat from offering certain existing and future services via the intelsat and inmarsat satellite systems and might relieve major customers from existing traffic contracts with the corporation 
the bill could impair comsat s investment in intelsat and inmarsat by  among other actions  possibly requiring the return of orbital positions and spectrum needed in intelsat and inmarsat operations 
the bill also would direct the fcc to permit other companies to directly access the intelsat and inmarsat satellite systems in the us  thus discontinuing comsat s exclusive provider role  subject to certain safeguards that would insure fair compensation to comsat 
on the plus side  the bill would no longer require the fcc to defer action on the corporation s petition for non dominant carrier classification until direct access is granted 
the bill  however  would link the removal of the existing ownership limitation on comsat s common stock under the satellite act to the point in time when direct access is granted 
the bill also specifies criteria for the privatization and proposed restructuring of intelsat that  if not agreed to by the other member nations of intelsat  might restrict intelsat s proposed new commercial affiliate  inc  from accessing the us market 
in addition  if the privatization of intelsat and inmarsat is not completed by a mandatory timetable in accordance with the criteria  non core intelsat and inmarsat services might be foreclosed from us markets 
the corporation is  and will continue  opposing the bill  unless it is modified in an acceptable  pro competitive manner that would not adversely affect the corporation s business and the value of its shareholders investments in the intelsat and inmarsat satellite systems 
effective january   the corporation changed its accounting policy with respect to the cost of series satellites lost at launch or in orbit 
such costs will be expensed in the period in which the satellite is lost at launch or experiences a total failure in orbit 
previously  the costs of such failed series satellites were amortized over their original useful lives 
partial in orbit failures will be evaluated for impairment according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
effective january   the corporation also changed its accounting policy with respect to satellite performance incentives paid to manufacturers to capitalize the net present value of such payments as a component of the cost of the satellite 
previously  certain of these payments were expensed as paid 
these changes will not have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
comsat world systems cws continues to be well positioned with major international carriers through long term agreements to provide cost competitive services for bulk usage beyond the year in addition  cws expects growth from the provision of services in emerging markets  including international vsat and asynchronous transfer mode atm services 
cws is expected to face increasing competition over the longer term 
in addition to seven satellites currently on order  intelsat has signed a lease for capacity aboard the insat e satellite in the asia pacific region  planned for launch in the second half of intelsat launched four viii series satellites successfully in and plans for two launches in the new intelsat viii series satellites offer higher power c band capabilities to address various markets 
comsat mobile communications cmc plans to continue to expand its service offerings and value added products to meet anticipated growth in customers needs 
the increasing number of digital terminals with improved operating efficiency and reduced service charges are expected to continue to provide traffic growth in land mobile  small commercial and pleasure boat  and business traveler markets 
cmc expects to continue to face increasing competition from existing inmarsat service providers  other wireless communications services including c band and other potential market entrants 
in late  the federal aviation administration faa selected cmc to provide satellite and uplink services for the wide area augmentation system waas 
the initial contract is expected to generate revenues of million through and could generate revenues of up to million if all options are exercised through in late and early  the corporation reduced its direct ownership in ico and presently owns 
the corporation also continues to hold an indirect share of ico through its ownership in inmarsat  which is also an ico shareholder 
the corporation is evaluating its plans with respect to distribution of ico products and services and will continue to assess whether its direct ownership is properly aligned with those plans 
as with any new product  there are a number of factors that may affect the corporation s ability to offer planet and ico services on a profitable basis 
such factors include the level of consumer acceptance and demand  the quality and pricing of competitive services  and the performance of ground and space systems and customer terminals 
in order to offer planet and ico services  the corporation must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
see notes and to the financial statements 
in addition  ico must receive the funding required to complete its satellite system 
network services comsat international ci will continue to operate an integrated group of telecommunications companies that are engaged principally in providing individualized digital network solutions to business clients and carriers in selected markets 
ci also plans to develop prospective international telecommunications opportunities that are consistent with its digital networking strategy 
in this regard  ci will continue to target those rapidly growing markets where a significant number of ci s existing or targeted clients are located or in which they intend to locate 
ci s general financial performance benchmark is for individual companies to be operationally cash flow positive within three years and profitable after five years of operation absent unforeseen circumstances or problems 
as part of its integrated approach to management of those companies  ci evaluates operating performance  strategic fit and overall effectiveness of managerial control to determine whether to continue to increase or reduce its investment in individual companies 
ci is currently reviewing its investment in belcom 
in early  the communications secretariat of argentina secretariat issued resolutions which reserve for nahuelsat  the domestic argentine satellite operator  certain exclusive rights for the sale of domestic ku band satellite services in argentina 
comsat argentina has reserved sufficient ku band capacity to address its current and future business requirements through following  however  comsat argentina will be required to secure additional capacity from nahuelsat for new business 
there can be no assurance that adequate ku band space segment will be available at that time  or that nahuelsat will have adequate back up capacity in the event of a satellite failure  or that if space segment is available  it will be priced competitively 
in september  the secretariat issued a resolution that permits telintar  the exclusive provider of international voice telephony and data services in argentina  to provide switched domestic internet services within argentina 
the resolution is drafted broadly enough that it also may be construed to permit telintar to provide switched domestic data services 
presently it is unclear  however  whether the secretariat will interpret the resolution to apply to domestic data services 
comsat argentina challenged the resolution on the ground that domestic switching of internet and or data services by telintar is not permitted under its franchise 
in november  comsat argentina received a preliminary injunction suspending the resolution 
the injunction will remain in effect until the secretariat rules on comsat argentina s request for administrative relief from the resolution 
the secretariat has also appealed the imposition of the preliminary injunction 
the resolution  together with other recent actions of the secretariat  including its resolutions awarding nahuelsat the exclusive right to sell domestic ku band capacity in argentina  appears to indicate a willingness of the secretariat to adopt initiatives that benefit large  domestic and incumbent telecommunications service providers to the detriment of competitors  such as comsat argentina  which are smaller than the domestic incumbents 
the corporation intends to monitor regulatory developments in argentina closely 
there can be no assurance  however  that the recent actions of the secretariat or other regulatory developments in respect to those actions will be resolved without any material affect on comsat argentina s future business prospects 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year ie for 
certain of the corporation s computer programs that have date sensitive software may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  to the extent that this situation may exist  there is a potential for computer system failure or miscalculations  which could cause disruption of operations 
the problem is not limited to computer programs  as some of the corporation s equipment that has date sensitive processors may not be able to process dates after december  in the second half of  the corporation initiated a program to identify and properly address issues associated with the year problem in order to avoid interruption to the corporation s operations at the turn of the century 
the corporation has made substantial progress in assessing how it will be impacted by the year issue 
currently  the corporation is in the process of modifying or replacing computer systems and other date sensitive equipment  so that the corporation s key systems will be year compliant 
the corporation presently believes that such changes to the corporation s key systems and equipment will be completed and tested by the end of the second quarter of the corporation s current estimate is that it will cost between million and million prior to january   to modify its in house management information systems  customer products  and other systems and equipment impacted by the year issue 
the corporation does not expect the costs directly attributable to the year issue to have a material effect on its consolidated results from operations in a given year 
year modifications and replacements are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of resources and the reliability of third party modification plans 
specific factors that might cause material differences in the estimates include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel with appropriate necessary skills  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code and similar uncertainties 
analysis of consolidated balance sheets assets the corporation ended with billion of assets  as compared to billion at december  included in current assets in each of their respective periods were million and million associated with the net assets of discontinued operations 
current assets decreased during by million  of which million was related to the spinoff of ascent which occurred in june see note to the financial statements 
property and equipment additions amounted to million for the increase in property and equipment was primarily related to the investment in new communication property and equipment at ci and additions related to cws s and cmc s share of intelsat and inmarsat satellite programs 
investments decreased million during as the corporation sold its remaining interest in philcom in january at book value of million 
see notes and to the financial statements 
liabilities the corporation s total liabilities increased during by million 
this was primarily the result of a million increase in borrowings and an increase of million related to the clarksburg  maryland building financing transaction 
see note to the financial statements 
analysis of cash flows  liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash from operating activities for was million  below the satellite services segment generated the majority of the corporation s cash from operations 
the corporation made interest payments  net of amounts capitalized  of million and tax payments of million 
during  the corporation used million in investing activities  a decrease from the purchases of property and equipment occurred in both the satellite services and network services segments  as the corporation continued to make capital investments equal to its related shares of intelsat s and inmarsat s satellite programs and purchased communications plant and equipment predominantly in ci s latin american companies 
the corporation expects to make additional investments in property and equipment in at approximately the same level as cash proceeds from financing activities in were a net million  as the corporation received million as a result of the clarksburg financing transaction 
see note to the financial statements 
of the total increase in short term borrowings  million was used to repurchase million of long term debt 
see note to the financial statements 
the quarterly dividend throughout and the first quarter of was per share and for the last three quarters of was per share 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation s working capital at december   was million  million lower than at december  the decrease in working capital during was primarily the result of the reduction in current assets of million due to the spinoff of ascent on june  see note to the financial statements  and the use of million of commercial paper to repurchase long term debt see note to the financial statements 
cash from operating activities and short term borrowings will be used for the near term to fund growth and to finance working capital needs 
the corporation has access to short term and long term financing at favorable rates 
the corporation s current long term debt ratings are a from standard and poor s and a from moody s 
the corporation s current commercial paper ratings are a from standard and poor s and p from moody s 
the corporation s million commercial paper program had million in borrowings outstanding at december  a million credit agreement  expiring in  backs up the corporation s commercial paper program 
the corporation plans to reduce short term debt with the proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets and operations of crsi 
consummation of the sale of crsi  however  remains subject to certain conditions 
see management s discussion and analysis outlook 
during  the corporation repurchased a total of million of its notes due using proceeds from short term debt 
this reduced the total outstanding of the notes from million at december   to million at december  in addition  the corporation repurchased million of its medium term notes using proceeds from short term debt 
this reduced the corporation s total outstanding medium term notes from million at december   to million at december  the corporation had million remaining under a million medium term note program at december  the medium term note program is part of a million debt securities shelf registration program initiated in the corporation s capital structure and debt financing activities are regulated by the fcc 
the corporation is required to submit a capitalization plan to the fcc for review annually 
in august  the fcc approved the corporation s capitalization plan 
under the approved fcc guidelines  the corporation is subject to a limit of million in short term debt  a maximum long term  debt to total capital ratio of and an interest coverage ratio of to the latter two guidelines are measured at year end 
the corporation was in compliance with the guidelines at december   with a long term  debt to total capital ratio of  million in short term debt outstanding and an interest coverage ratio of to if the corporation were to fail to satisfy one or more of the fcc guidelines as of an applicable measurement date  the corporation would be required to seek advance fcc approval of future financing activities on a case by case basis 
if such approval were not granted  the corporation could be required to reduce or reschedule planned capital investments  reduce cash outlays  reduce debt or sell assets
