sales of reconstructive products increased to  in  led by the foundation r total knee  hip and shoulder systems 
trauma product sales remained relatively flat at  when compared to the prior year 
the increase in reconstructive products is attributed primarily to the expansion of the us sales force 
continued transition from a non exclusive to an exclusive sales force is a major factor for the flat sales of trauma products 
the company anticipates sales of trauma products to increase as the transition to an exclusive sales force is completed in and the product base is expanded 
going forward  rapid geographical expansion and introduction of new products will fuel additional increases in sales in both the total joint and trauma segments of the business 
gross margin increased to  in  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales for this gross margin increase resulted from increased us sales  which generate a greater gross margin than sales outside the us  manufacturing efficiencies and cost controls 
for the future  gross margin should continue to improve due to reasons stated above and the increase in volume

sales of reconstructive products increased to  from  while sales of trauma products decreased slightly to  from  the increase in reconstructive product sales resulted from continued expansion of the sales force in more productive sales territories 
the decline in sales of trauma products resulted from the transition in sales forces as a result of the aos acquisition in may the gross margin for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to from 
this increase was primarily due to increased volume  changes in the sales mix and continuing refinement of manufacturing processes 
the change in the sales mix resulted from greater us sales  which carry a higher margin than sales outside the us  and increased sales of higher margin products to distributors outside the us  us  implants which have a higher margin than instrument sales to distributors outside the us 
some of the margin improvement is offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses described below 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales increased to from 
this increase reflects higher commission expenses as a result of increased us sales which carry higher commission rates than sales outside the us  additional infrastructure to support new product lines  an expanded sales distribution network in anticipation of additional sales to be generated in the future  costs related to encore s acquisition of aos  and costs to shut down aos california operations

operating income increased to  from  for compared to  a increase  due primarily to the growth in sales exceeding the increase in operating expenses 
net income decreased to  from  for as compared to the primary reason for the decrease in net income as compared to the increase in operating income was the increase in interest expense attributable to the outstanding term debt to sirrom capital corporation  which was outstanding for the full period in as opposed to only a partial period august to december in also  the amount of the outstanding term debt increased from  to  in february there was a significant decrease in net income applicable to common stock in as a result of a change in the valuation of common stock put warrants held by sirrom capital corporation for financial accounting purposes 
these warrants contained a put feature that allowed them to be redeemed for cash in the years and at fair market value 
as such  they are reflected in the financial statements at their current fair market value 
the change in reflects the increase in the value of the encore common shares 
while this change in value does not affect net income  it does affect net income applicable to common stock according to generally accepted accounting principles 
this put feature was eliminated as a condition of the merger with hcac in march capital expenditures encore has spent a significant amount of its resources over the past several years on building a state of the art  fully integrated orthopedic implant company 
these expenditures have included the investment in surgical instrumentation  machine tools to increase manufacturing capacity  computer hardware and software  and equipment required to support a growing organization 
over the last two years  encore has acquired machine tools primarily through capital leases 
encore has made significant investments in surgical instrumentation as such instrumentation is necessary to implant encore reconstructive products 
also  the size of the sales force and the increases in the product lines have necessitated increases in the need for additional surgical instruments 
in the united states  these instruments are capitalized and depreciated 
they are loaned to the sales force without charge to aid in sales 
internationally  these instruments are sold to the distributors at cost 
the amounts of surgical instruments capitalized in  and were   and  respectively 
other capital expenditures during these periods were   and  respectively 
as a growing organization  encore has devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving its management information systems through additions of hardware and software 
the expenditures for these computer improvements were approximately  in and  in from its inception encore has been aware of the year problem and has required that all of its systems address this issue 
therefore  the year transition should not have a material adverse impact on future results 
encore relocated its facilities in january   thus requiring expenditures for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
these expenditures were approximately  encore s relocation resulted in the unification of its manufacturing and administrative functions and provides encore the space it needs to meet its objectives over the forseeable future 
liquidity over the past three years  encore s working capital requirements have increased 
the increases have been in the areas of inventory and accounts receivable as sales and product base have expanded 
during  encore increased the amounts available to it under its credit facilities by entering into a  revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  na  which is secured by a lien on all of encore s assets the credit facility 
the interest being charged is a floating prime rate or encore has the option of locking in a fixed amount for  or days at libor plus 
at december   prime equaled while a day lock at libor plus equaled 
as of december   encore had drawn million on its credit facility with an eligible borrowing base of million 
of this million  million was fixed at the lower rate while the remainder was at prime 
this credit facility matures on may  a distinguishing feature of the credit facility is that encore s cash management services are intermingled with it 
encore s bank accounts sweep  on a daily basis  funds to either reduce or increase the loan balance  as needed  and invests any excess funds if the loan balance equals zero  in a money market account 
as such  the outstanding loan balance is adjusted daily based on the net amount of cash receipts versus cash outlays  while the cash balance at wells fargo remains at zero as long as encore is a net borrower 
this sweep feature has the effect of minimizing interest cost  and automatically investing any excess funds 
cash was provided by operating activities for in prior years  cash flow from operating activities was a primary use of cash 
the increase in working capital  primarily inventory  continues to have a negative impact on cash flow from operating activities 
the amounts of inventory increase in   and were   and  respectively 
this build up of inventory was required to support the increase in product lines  the growing sales network  and the growth in overall sales that encore has sustained over the past several years and anticipates in the increases in inventory in and were due to the introduction of several new products  and the increase in the number of sales territories in which encore s products are or will be sold 
additionally  as sales increase  accounts receivable will increase 
encore believes that through the combination of the cash generated from sales and its credit facilities  the cash available to meet its needs will be sufficient over at least the next twelve months 
thereafter or sooner  in the event that encore consummates an acquisition  it will require additional funds 
it is also anticipated as encore grows and performs  increased credit facilities will be available until such time that the outstanding warrants are exercised

these forward looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements
