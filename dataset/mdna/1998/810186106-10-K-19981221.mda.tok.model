item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care  professional turf care and professional horticulture businesses in the united states and europe 
the company s operations are divided into three business segments north american consumer  professional and international 
the north american consumer segment includes the lawns  gardens and growing media business groups 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  the company focuses on its consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  to create demand to pull product through the retail distribution channels 
during fiscal  the company spent million on advertising and promotional activities  an increase of over fiscal excluding the impact of fiscal acquisitions 
management believes that the company receives a significant return on these increased marketing expenditures 
for example  sales in the company s consumer lawns business group increased from fiscal to fiscal  which the company believes resulted primarily from its increased consumer oriented marketing efforts 
the company expects that it will continue to focus its marketing efforts toward the consumer and to increase consumer marketing expenditures in the future to drive market share and sales growth 
the company s sales are seasonal in nature and are susceptible to global weather conditions  primarily in north america and europe 
for instance  periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales but can create increased demand for pesticides 
periods of dry  hot weather can have the opposite effect on fertilizer and pesticide sales 
the company believes that its recent acquisitions diversify both its product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
on september   the company entered into a long term exclusive agency and marketing agreement the roundup marketing agreement with monsanto for its consumer roundup r herbicide products 
under the roundup marketing agreement  the company and monsanto will jointly develop global consumer and trade marketing programs for roundup r and the company has assumed responsibility for sales support  merchandising  distribution  logistics and certain administrative functions 
in addition  the company has signed a definitive agreement to purchase from monsanto the assets of its worldwide consumer lawn and garden businesses  exclusive of the roundup business the ortho acquisition 
these transactions with monsanto will further the company s strategic objective of significantly enhancing its position in the pesticides segment of the consumer lawn and garden category 
these businesses will make up the newly created consumer pesticides business group within the north american consumer segment 
management believes that the acquisitions will provide the company with several strategic benefits including immediate market penetration  geographic expansion  brand leveraging opportunities and the achievement of substantial cost savings 
the company is currently a leader in four segments of the consumer lawn and garden category lawn fertilizer  garden fertilizer  growing media and grass seeds 
the ortho acquisition when completed and the roundup marketing agreement will provide the company with an immediate entry into the fifth segment of the consumer lawn and garden category the us pesticides segment 
the addition of the us pesticides product line completes the company s product portfolio and positions the company as the only national company with a complete offering of consumer products 
the addition of strong pesticide brands will complete the company s product portfolio of powerful branded consumer lawn and garden products that should provide the company with brand leveraging opportunities for revenue growth 
for example  the company s strengthened market position should create category management opportunities to enhance shelf positioning  consumer communication  trade incentives and trade programs 
in addition  significant synergies should be realized from the combined businesses  including reductions in general and administrative  sales  distribution  purchasing  research and development and corporate overhead costs 
management expects to redirect a portion of these cost savings into increased consumer marketing spending to support the ortho r brand 
over the past two years  the company has made several other acquisitions to strengthen its global market position in the lawn and garden category 
in october  the company purchased rpj  for an estimated purchase price of million 
rpj is a leading european consumer lawn and garden business 
the rpj acquisition provides a significant addition to the scotts company and subsidiaries the company s existing european platform and strengthens its foothold in the continental european consumer lawn and garden market 
through this acquisition  the company will establish a strong presence in france  germany  austria and the benelux countries 
the rpj acquisition may also mitigate  to a certain extent  the company s susceptibility to weather conditions by expanding the regions in which the company operates 
in february  the company acquired earthgro  inc earthgro  a northeastern us growing media producer 
in december  the company acquired levington group limited levington  a leading producer of consumer and professional lawn fertilizer and growing media in the united kingdom 
in january  the company acquired the approximate two thirds interest in miracle holdings limited miracle holdings which the company did not already own 
miracle holdings owns miracle garden care limited miracle garden  a manufacturer and distributor of lawn and garden products in the united kingdom 
these acquisitions are consistent with the company s stated objective of becoming the world s foremost branded lawn and garden company

during fiscal  the company reported net income of million  or per common share  compared with a net loss of million  or per the scotts company and subsidiaries common share  in fiscal the return to profitability in was attributable to a variety of factors  including the refocused  pull directed marketing strategy of the consumer lawns group compared to the retailer early purchase program that severely discounted this group s leading branded products  sales volume increases in the consumer gardens group  consumer growing media group and professional segment strategies that focused on profitable growth and eliminated sales of marginal products and to unprofitable distribution channels  improved weather conditions in fiscal in most key markets  improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies  and other cost improvements  and lower interest expense before the impact of miracle garden related borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided from operations for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased working capital levels in fiscal to support increased sales revenues

cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal was due to the cost of businesses acquired during the year or to be acquired in fiscal and an increase in capital expenditures of million primarily due to costs incurred to upgrade certain manufacturing facilities to more technologically advanced production capabilities

total debt as of september  was million  an increase of million from a year earlier 
the increase in debt year to year was primarily due to borrowings to fund the levington and earthgro acquisitions

the outstanding principal amount of all revolving credit loans may not exceed million for at least consecutive days during any calendar year 
the company funded the rpj acquisition with borrowings under the new credit facilities 
the company expects to fund the ortho acquisition with proceeds from an anticipated private debt offering to qualified institutional buyers and certain borrowings under the new credit facilities 
management estimates that capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal  million to million for each of the following three years and approximately million per year thereafter for the foreseeable future 
included in these estimates are amounts to be spent on the company s information systems initiative in fiscal and fiscal subject to certain contingencies  including the successful completion of the ortho acquisition  the board of directors of the company has authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions on or prior to september  as of september   approximately  common shares or million had been repurchased under the company s previously announced stock repurchase program  all of which will be applied to the new repurchase program limit 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the new repurchase program will be at the company s discretion and will depend upon market conditions and the company s operating performance and liquidity 
any repurchase will also be subject to the covenants contained in the company s new credit facilities as well as its other debt instruments 
the repurchased shares will be held in treasury and will thereafter be used for the exercise of employee stock options and for other valid corporate purposes 
the company anticipates that any repurchases would be made pro rata from the former shareholders of stern s miracle gro products  inc the miracle gro shareholders upon terms no less favorable to the company than those obtainable in the public market 
the agreement governing the merger transactions with the miracle gro shareholders requires that they reduce their percentage ownership in the company to no more than on a fully diluted basis to the extent that repurchases by the company would cause such ownership to exceed 
gains and losses on foreign currency transaction hedges are recognized in income and offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
gains and losses on foreign currency firm commitment hedges are deferred and included in the basis of the transactions underlying the commitments 
at september   there were no outstanding foreign currency transaction hedges or firm commitment hedges 
in the opinion of the company s management  cash flows from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  the company cannot ensure that its business groups will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all  or that future borrowings will be available under the new credit facilities in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company cannot ensure that it will be able to refinance any indebtedness  including the new credit facilities  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all

the company is involved in several the scotts company and subsidiaries environmental related legal actions with various governmental agencies 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  however  there can be no assurance that future quarterly or annual operating results will not be materially affected by the resolution of these matters 
additional information on environmental matters affecting the company is provided in note to the company s consolidated financial statements and in this annual report on form k under item business environmental and regulatory considerations and item legal proceedings

unless modified or replaced  these systems could fail or create erroneous results when referencing the year management is assessing the extent and impact of this issue and is implementing a readiness program to mitigate the possibility of business interruption or other risks 
the objective of the program is to have all significant business systems year compliant by mid the company has established a year program office to oversee the readiness program

the company s year compliance efforts are being concentrated on the currently existing systems to ensure there is adequate information systems support until implementation of the enterprise wide system is completed 
non it systems non it systems  comprised mainly of equipment and machinery operating and control systems  telecommunication systems  building air management systems  security and fire control systems  electrical and natural gas systems  are being assessed by each business group with advice from suppliers of these systems services 
upgrades or replacements are being made as necessary 
the scotts company and subsidiaries third party suppliers the company relies on third party suppliers for finished goods  raw materials  water  other utilities  transportation and a variety of other key services 
interruption of supplier operation due to year issues could affect company operations 
the company is evaluating the status of suppliers efforts through confirmation and follow up procedures to determine contingency planning where necessary 
recent acquisitions the company has recently completed the rpj acquisition and has entered into an agreement with monsanto under which it agreed to become the exclusive consumer marketing agent for monsanto s roundup r herbicide products 
due diligence reviews of the year readiness status for each of these businesses have been completed 
the rpj acquisition has both it and non it year considerations 
the roundup marketing agreement does not involve the acquisition of assets  however  additional efforts are necessary to confirm year readiness by the company s business partners 
representations have been provided in the definitive agreement signed in conjunction with the ortho acquisition that the ortho business is year compliant in all material respects 
the company is in the process of compiling year reporting from these operations and will include site visits as part of the verification efforts 
due to the timing of these transactions  the company s current estimates of costs and completion dates do not include these businesses 
state of readiness each business group has substantially completed an internal inventory which is designed to identify it and non it systems that are susceptible to system failure or processing errors as a result of year issues 
the headquarters mainframe remediation project is more than half complete and is scheduled for completion including testing in mid plans are in place for the upgrade or replacement and testing of it systems at other u 
s 
operations by mid non it efforts are being performed concurrently and replacement and testing is expected to be completed by mid site visits are being planned by the program office to verify progress against plans 
year readiness plans are being executed within the international segment 
upgrades of packaged software for the primary systems will be completed by early completion of all it and non it upgrades and testing is scheduled for mid site visits are being planned by the program office to verify progress against plans 
a confirmation process with respect to third party suppliers is in progress 
plans are being formulated for site visits and other testing with critical suppliers to determine if alternative sources are needed 
due diligence efforts to date for pending acquisitions have revealed that plans exist by the seller to timely address material year issues 
costs the company has been tracking incremental year costs which excludes the costs of internally dedicated resources 
the current estimate of incremental costs for the year efforts excluding those related to the rpj acquisition  the roundup marketing agreement  other pending acquisitions and the erp project is approximately million 
of this amount  million has been incurred to date 
these costs  with the exception of relatively small capital expenditures  are being expensed as incurred and are being funded through operating cash flows 
a summary of the cost components follows in millions fiscal fiscal location total actual estimate headquarters mainframe other u 
s 
operations and program office international operations total the above costs do not include costs of year efforts for acquisitions not deemed material 
the costs of the headquarters mainframe work represents and of actual and budgeted it expenditures excluding erp  respectively 
the company believes that year costs have not had and will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
risks the principal business risks to the company relating to completion of year efforts are reliance on key business partners to not have disruption in the ability to provide goods and services as a result of year issues 
the ability to recruit and or retain key staff for the year effort 
the scotts company and subsidiaries unforeseen issues arising in connection with recent and future acquisitions business partnerships 
the ability to continue to focus on year issues by internal and external resources 
because the company s year readiness is dependent upon key business partners also being year ready  there can be no guarantee that the company s efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the possible consequences to the company of its key business partners inability to provide goods and services as a result of year issues include temporary plant closings  delays in delivery of finished products  delays in receipt of key ingredients  containers and packaging supplies  invoice and collection errors  and inventory and supply obsolescence 
the company believes that its readiness efforts  which include confirmation  site visits and other testing with critical suppliers to determine if contingency planning is needed  should reduce the likelihood of such disruptions 
contingency plans a formal contingency plan has not yet been developed 
the company will continue to assess where alternative courses of action are needed as the it and non it readiness plans are executed 
the drive for formal contingency planning will be in the second quarter of  once a significant amount of the business groups readiness plans have been completed 
ongoing process the company s readiness program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various components of the program described above are subject to change 
enterprise resource planning erp in july  the company announced a project designed to bring its information system resources in line with the company s current strategic objectives 
the project will include the redesign of certain key business processes in connection with the installation of new software on a world wide basis over the course of the next two fiscal years 
the company estimates that the project will cost million  approximately of which will be capitalized over a period of four to eight years 
sap has been selected as the primary software provider for this project 
euro beginning in january  a new currency called the euro is scheduled to be introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency

additionally  the european commission has not yet defined and formalized all of the final rules and regulations 
the company is still assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on its internal systems and the sale of its products 
the company expects to take appropriate actions based on the results of such assessment 
the company has not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management s outlook fiscal was a very strong year for the company as it reported record sales of billion and achieved market share growth in every one of its major u 
s 
categories 
the year s performance reflected the successful continuation of its primary growth drivers to emphasize consumer oriented marketing efforts to pull demand through its distribution channels  and to make strategic acquisitions to increase market share in global markets and within segments of the lawn and garden category 
restructuring charges taken in fiscal reflect the costs to integrate recent acquisitions and to exit businesses that are not strategically aligned with the company s core businesses 
going forward  these actions should allow the company to fully realize the operational synergies created by the acquisitions and to focus resources in businesses that provide opportunities for growth 
looking forward  the company maintains the following broad tenets to its strategic plan promote and capitalize on the strengths of the scotts r  miracle gro r and hyponex r industry leading brands  as well as those brands acquired and to be acquired in conjunction with the rpj acquisition and ortho acquisition  respectively 
this involves a commitment to investors and retail partners that the company will support these brands through advertising and promotion unequaled in the lawn and garden consumables market 
in the professional categories  it signifies a commitment to customers to provide the scotts company and subsidiaries value as an integral element in their long term success  commit to continuously study and improve knowledge of the market  the consumer and the competition  simplify product lines and business processes  to focus on those that deliver value  evaluate marginal ones and eliminate those that lack future prospects  and achieve world leadership in operations  leveraging technology and know how to deliver outstanding customer service and quality 
within the company s four year strategic plan  management has established challenging  but realistic  financial goals  including sales growth of to in core businesses  an aggregate operating margin improvement of at least over the next four years  and minimum compounded annual eps growth of 
forward looking statements the company has made and will make certain forward looking statements in its annual report  form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
these forward looking statements represent challenging goals for the company  and the achievement thereof is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond the company s control 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  information regarding the future economic performance and financial condition of the company  the plans and objectives of the company s management and the company s assumptions regarding such performance and plans 
therefore  it is possible that the company s future actual financial results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the following effect of weather conditions adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results 
weather conditions in north america and europe have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales  while periods of dry  hot weather can decrease pesticide sales 
in particular  an abnormally cold spring throughout the united states could adversely affect the company s financial results  effect of seasonality historical seasonality could impair the company s ability to make interest payments on indebtedness 
because the company s products are used primarily in the spring and summer  the business is highly seasonal 
for the past two fiscal years  approximately of sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
working capital needs  and correspondingly borrowings  peak at the end of the first fiscal quarter during which the company generates fewer revenues while incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season 
if the company is unable to draw on the new credit facilities when an interest payment is due on the other indebtedness  this seasonality could adversely affect the company s ability to make interest payments as required by other indebtedness 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk  continued marketplace acceptance of the company s north american consumer groups pull advertising marketing strategies acceptance is particularly important in the consumer lawns group which refocused its general marketing strategy beginning in fiscal  the ability to maintain profit margins on its products  to produce its products on a timely basis and to maintain and develop additional production capacity as necessary to meet demand  competition among lawn and garden care product producers supplying the consumer and professional markets  both in north america and europe  competition between and the recent consolidation within the retail outlets selling lawn and garden care products produced by the company  the scotts company and subsidiaries public perceptions regarding the safety of the products produced and marketed by the company  risks associated with international operations the company s significant international operations make it more susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to the costs of international regulation 
the company currently operates manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america and particularly in the united kingdom  germany and france 
international operations have increased with the acquisitions of levington  miracle garden and rpj and will increase further through the roundup marketing agreement and the ortho acquisition 
in fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of total sales 
therefore  the company is subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries 
many foreign countries have tended to suffer from inflation more than the united states 
in addition  by operating in a large number of countries  the company incurs additional costs of compliance with local regulations 
the company has attempted to hedge some currency exchange rate risks  including by borrowing in local currencies  but such hedges do not eliminate the risk completely 
the costs related to international operations could adversely affect operations and financial results in the future  effect of new european currency the implementation of the euro currency in certain european countries in could adversely impact the company 
beginning in january  a new currency called the euro is scheduled to be introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
additionally  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been defined and finalized by the european commission with regard to the euro currency 
the company is still assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on internal systems and the sale of its products 
the company expects to take appropriate actions based on the results of such assessment 
however  the company has not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition  changes in economic conditions in the united states and the impact of changes in interest rates  addressing year issues the failure of the company  or the failure of third party suppliers or retailer customers  to address information technology issues related to the year could adversely affect operations 
like other business entities  the company must address the ability of its computer software applications and other business systems eg  embedded microchips to properly identify the year due to a commonly used programming convention of using only two digits to identify a year 
unless modified or replaced  these systems could fail or create erroneous results when referencing the year while the company is assessing the relevant issues related to the year problem and has implemented a readiness program to mitigate the possibility of business interruption or other risks  the company cannot be sure that it will have adequately addressed the issue  particularly with respect to recent and pending acquisitions 
moreover  the company relies on third party suppliers for finished goods  raw materials  water  other utilities  transportation and a variety of other key services 
if one or more of these suppliers fail to address the year problem adequately  such suppliers operations could be interrupted 
such interruption  in turn  could adversely affect the company s operations 
in addition  the failure of retailer customers adequately to address the year problem could adversely affect financial results  the ability to improve processes and business practices to keep pace with the economic  competitive and technological environment  including successful completion of the erp project  environmental regulation compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could result in the expenditure of significant capital resources 
local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect the company in several ways 
all products containing pesticides must be registered with the us environmental protection agency and in many cases  similar state and or foreign agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any such registration could have an the scotts company and subsidiaries adverse effect on the company 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether competitors were similarly affected 
the company attempts to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals  but may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
regulations regarding the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations such as not for use on sod farms or golf courses  may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied  may require notification of individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients 
in addition  with the rpj acquisition and assuming the ortho acquisition is consummated  the company has acquired or will acquire many new pesticide product lines that are subject to additional regulations 
even if the company is able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  the company cannot assure that its products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results  control by significant shareholders the interests of the miracle gro shareholders could conflict with those of the other shareholders or noteholders 
the miracle gro shareholders through the hagedorn partnership  lp beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common shares of the company on a fully diluted basis 
while the agreement governing the merger transactions with the miracle gro shareholders places certain voting restrictions on the miracle gro shareholders through may   the miracle gro shareholders have the right to designate three members of the company s board of directors and have the ability to veto significant corporate actions by the company 
in addition  after may   the miracle gro shareholders will be able to vote their shares without restriction and will be able to significantly control the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of the company s shareholders 
the interests of the miracle gro shareholders could conflict with those of the company s other shareholders  substantial leverage the company has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect the financial health of the company and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations under certain indebtedness 
substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to shareholders 
for example  it could make it more difficult to satisfy obligations with respect to such indebtedness  increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit the ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the company s business and the industry in which it operates  place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company s indebtedness  among other things  the ability to borrow additional funds 
and  failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company  ability to service debt to service indebtedness  the company will require a significant amount of cash 
the company s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control 
the ability to make payments on and to refinance indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
based on the current level the scotts company and subsidiaries of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements  the company believes its cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under the new credit facility will be adequate to meet its future liquidity needs for at least the next few years 
the company cannot assure  however  that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available under the new credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  or to fund other liquidity needs 
the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness  on or before maturity 
the company cannot ensure that it will be able to refinance any of its indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  integration issues inability to integrate the acquisitions made could prevent the company from maximizing synergies and could adversely affect financial results 
the company has made several substantial acquisitions in the past four years 
the ortho acquisition will represent the largest 
the success of any completed acquisition depends  and the success of the ortho acquisition will depend  on the ability to integrate effectively the acquired business 
the company believes that the rpj acquisition provides and the ortho acquisition will provide significant cost saving opportunities 
however  if the company is not able to successfully integrate ortho  rpj or other acquired businesses  the company will not be able to maximize such cost saving opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate such acquired businesses  because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors  could materially adversely affect financial results  customer concentration because of the concentration of sales to a small number of retail customers  the loss of one or more of the company s top customers could adversely affect financial results 
the company s top customers together accounted for approximately of fiscal year sales and of outstanding accounts receivable as of september  the top two customers  the home depot and wal mart  represented approximately and  respectively  of fiscal year sales and approximately and  respectively  of outstanding accounts receivable at september  the loss of  or reduction in orders from  the home depot  wal mart or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters with  or the inability to collect accounts receivable from  any of such customers  termination of roundup marketing agreement monsanto has the right to terminate the roundup marketing agreement  either as a whole or within a particular region  for certain events of default 
if monsanto terminates the roundup marketing agreement without having to pay a termination fee  the company would lose a substantial source of future earnings  post patent sales of roundup r in the united states glyphosate  the active ingredient in roundup r  is subject to a patent in the united states that expires in september the company cannot predict the success of roundup r after glyphosate ceases to be patented 
substantial new competition in the united states could adversely affect the company 
glyphosate is no longer subject to patent in the european union and is not subject to patent in canada 
while sales of roundup r in such countries have continued to increase despite the lack of patent protection  sales in the united states may decline as a result of increased competition after the us patent expires
