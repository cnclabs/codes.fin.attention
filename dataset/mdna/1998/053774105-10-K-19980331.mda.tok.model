item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in recurring operations  the company must deal with effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the following discussion presents an overview of how such changes are managed and a view of their potential effects 
the company uses various financial instruments  particularly interest rate and currency swaps and currency forwards  to manage its respective interest rate and currency risks 
the company is exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
the company does not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
established practices require that derivative financial instruments relate to specific asset  liability or equity transactions or to currency exposures 
more detailed information about these financial instruments  as well as the strategies and policies for their use  is provided in notes and to the financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange in their financial statements 
although the rules offer alternatives for presenting this information  none of the alternatives is without limitations 
the following discussion is based on so called shock tests  which model effects of interest rate and currency shifts on the reporting company 
shock tests  while probably the most meaningful analysis permitted  are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
while the following results of shock tests for interest rate and currencies may have some limited use as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
o one means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical change decrease in interest rates across all maturities sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  it is estimated that  all else constant  such a decrease would not adversely impact the net earnings of the company based on year end positions 
o one means of assessing exposure to changes in currency exchange rates is to model effects on future earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
year end consolidated currency exposures  including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges  were analyzed to identify the company s assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currency 
net unhedged exposures in each currency were then remeasured assuming a change decrease in currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
under this model  it is estimated that  all else constant  such a decrease would not adversely impact the net earnings of the company based on year end positions 
the categories of primary market risk exposure of the company are i long term us interest rates due to mortgage loan origination commitments and an investment in mortgage loans held for resale  ii short term interest rates as they impact vehicle and relocation receivables  and iii libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings
