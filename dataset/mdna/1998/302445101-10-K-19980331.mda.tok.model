the company was profitable in the year ended december  and has reported profitable results for each succeeding year except for in which the company reported a loss of million due to the inclusion of a one time million acquisition related write off 
in june  the company completed an initial public offering of its stock  which is traded on the nasdaq national market system under the symbol flir 
in december  the company continued to expand the market potential for the growing commercial market as well as the government market by acquiring agema infrared systems ab  a corporation organized under the laws of sweden agema sweden  agema infrared systems limited  a corporation organized under the laws of the united kingdom agema uk  agema infrared systems ltd  a corporation organized under the laws of canada agema canada  and agema infrared systems  inc  a delaware corporation agema usa collectively agema or the agema entities 
agema is one the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of handheld infrared cameras for detecting and mapping temperature differences and for non contact temperature measurements for a wide variety of industrial and research applications 
agema s principal executive offices are located just outside stockholm  sweden 
agema sweden has three subsidiaries which operate sales and service offices in france  germany and italy 
additionally  agema canada  agema uk and agema usa own and operate sales and service offices in canada  great britain  and the united states  respectively 
the acquisition  which was effective on december   was accomplished through the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock to agema s parent company  spectra physics ab  also headquartered in stockholm  in exchange for all the outstanding shares of agema stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of the agema entities for the period from december  through december  are included in the consolidated results of operations 
the acquisition significantly diversifies the company s product offerings by adding agema s well regarded commercial handheld thermal imaging products to the company government and commercial product lines 
the acquisition will allow the company to reduce production costs by focusing commercial handheld product manufacturing at agema s facilities in stockholm and government and commercial broadcast product manufacturing in the company s facilities at portland 
the combined entity will benefit from combining agema s product design  packaging and thermographic experience with the company s image analysis software and stabilized gimbal experience 
finally  the two organizations have highly complementary sales and marketing capabilities and advanced development programs  including the next generation of low cost  uncooled infrared technologies 
the year ended december   was also highlighted by new product introductions  including the introduction of the extremely lightweight ultramedia rs tm  a compact camera system that gives small and weight restricted aircraft the ability to gather high quality video from long distances  the tracer tm  the first industrial imager capable of recording and analyzing long sequences of thermal activity on a real time basis  the ultra tm  a gyrostabilized dual sensor system that combines state of the art infrared technology and a color video camera to deliver high resolution images under extreme conditions  day or night  and the agema tm  the worlds first handheld uncooled radiometric thermal imaging system 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue government commercial total revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and other operating costs combination costs total operating expenses loss earnings from operations interest income interest expense and other loss earnings before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss earnings years ended december   and overall 
the company s revenue increased  from million in to million in net earnings  before non recurring charges associated with the agema acquisition  increased  from million or per diluted share in to million or per diluted share in after recording the one time  charge of million for costs associated with the agema acquisition  the net loss for was million or per diluted share 
the increase in overall revenue and net income  prior to acquisition related write offs  was primarily due to the continued sales growth of the ultramedia tm for the electronic news gathering market  continued strong sales of the safire tm night vision system for the government market  continued production and deliveries of handheld thermal imaging systems  higher international sales and a partial month of contribution from agema operations 
these increases were offset in part by an increase in interest expense related to increased short and long term borrowings  an increase in the effective tax rate and an increase in shares outstanding due to the agema acquisition 
during  the company s overall revenue increased  from million in to million in net earnings increased  from million or per diluted share in to million or per diluted share in the increase in overall revenue and net income was primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from the sale of the company s commercial broadcast products  principally the ultramedia tm which was introduced in april  as well as to increased deliveries of the safire tm night vision system to the federal government  particularly to the us marine corps and the us air force 
further  the increase in revenue and net income was due to the fact that government revenue was constrained due to delays in the finalization of several international and domestic contracts and the inclusion  in  of the significant one time transaction costs associated with the acquisition of optimas corporation optimas in early revenue 
revenue from the sale of night vision systems to the government market increased  from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to continued robust sales of the safire tm night vision system and increased deliveries to international customers  which typically have a higher sales price than domestic orders 
additionally  revenue from the sale of products manufactured by the company s united kingdom subsidiary increased during commercial revenue increased  from million in to million in this improvement was principally attributable to increased sales of the ultramedia tm  the company s airborne camera system for the electronic news gathering market  which aggregated million in compared to million in  further production and deliveries of the company s handheld imaging systems  which aggregated million in compared to million in  higher international sales  and the partial month contribution from agema s operations which aggregated million 
revenue in from the sale of night vision systems to the government market increased  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased sales of the safire tm night vision system  principally to the us marine corps and the us air force 
commercial revenue increased  from million in to million in this improvement was principally attributable to the inclusion of revenue from sales of the company s commercial broadcast products  primarily the ultramedia tm which was introduced in april the company has continued to benefit from its significant investment in developing worldwide sales and distribution channels 
the majority of the company s revenue outside the united states is from europe 
international revenue increased from million in to million in and accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in this represents an increase from the experienced in and the experienced in the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in was primarily due to increased shipments under the terms of existing international contracts  decreased shipments to us government customers  principally the us marine corps  and the inclusion of a partial month of agema revenue which are primarily international 
the company anticipates that revenue from international sales as a percentage of total revenue will continue to comprise a significant percentage of revenue but may vary modestly from year to year 
gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased from in to in  primarily due to the million write off of duplicative inventories related to the agema acquisition which was included in cost of goods sold in exclusive of this write off  gross margin remained relatively consistent at for compared to in the gross margin remained relatively consistent due to an increase in higher margin international sales and a decrease in sales to the us government which aggregated million in compared to million in and typically have lower margins than other sales to the government market 
this increase was mitigated by the increased proportion of sales of the company s commercial products which typically have slightly lower margins than government products 
gross profit decreased as a percentage of revenue from in to in  primarily due to the lower percentage of higher margin international sales in and increased sales to the us government 
gross profit percentages are affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of domestic and international government and commercial sales  the more competitive nature of the commercial market and the impact of competitive bids for significant government contracts 
research and development 
research and development expense increased  from million in to million in  and increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense decreased from in to in and decreased from in to in the increase in research and development expense  in absolute dollar terms  was attributable to increased research and development activities related to the introduction of the ultramedia rs tm  the ultra tm and the tracer tm  as well as to on going product enhancements 
further impacting research and development expense was the reclassification of development costs directly associated with engineering revenue as cost of goods sold rather than research and development expenses 
such costs amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
without these reclassifications  research and development expense as a percentage of revenue would be  and in  and  respectively  reflecting the fact that a large percentage of research and development expense is fixed in nature 
the general trend in research and development expense reflects the company s continuing emphasis on product development and new product introductions 
with the acquisition of agema  the engineering efforts for handheld thermographic products will be concentrated at agema s stockholm facility and the engineering efforts for government products and airborne broadcast cameras will be concentrated at the company s facilities in portland 
the company expects that research and development expense  in absolute dollars  will increase in as a result of the inclusion of a full year of agema operations 
however  as the company s revenues increase  and given the large percentage of research and development expense that is fixed in nature  such expenses should continue to decline slightly as a percentage of revenue 
selling and other operating costs 
selling and other operating costs increased in compared to and increased in compared to  primarily due to costs associated with increased revenue  particularly the increase in international sales  expenses related to the expanded operations of the company s united kingdom facility and to increased personnel 
further  the company has continued to expand and strengthen the direct sales and marketing staff 
selling and other operating costs as a percentage of revenue remained relatively consistent at in and in  and decreased slightly from in to in the company expects that selling and other operating costs will continue to grow in absolute dollar terms in as a result of the inclusion of a full year of agema operations  further planned sales force increases and anticipated increased marketing efforts and related expenses 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other includes costs related to short term and long term debt  capital lease obligations and miscellaneous bank charges and expenses 
the increase from  in to million in was primarily due to increased short term and long term debt as a result of increased working capital needs discussed below 
the increase from  in  exclusive of the one time costs associated with the acquisition of optimas to  in was due to the one time costs associated with the acquisition of optimas 
such acquisition expenses aggregated approximately  income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were substantially below the statutory rate as the company was able to realize the benefits of a portion of its net operating loss carryforwards and existing tax credits 
additionally  the company recognized a net deferred tax asset of million   and  in  and  respectively  under the recognition criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the million deferred tax asset recognized in relates primarily to the million write off in conjunction with the agema acquisition 
the current portion of income tax expense consists of state  federal and foreign income taxes  as the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and existing tax credits was limited 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million  which expire in the years through utilization of the company s acquired net operating loss carryforwards from optimas is limited to future earnings of optimas and further limited to approximately  per year  as optimas experienced a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
additionally  the company has various tax credits available aggregating million which expire in the years through agema acquisition effective december   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of agema in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock with a value of million and an additional million of direct acquisition costs 
agema designs  manufactures and markets handheld infrared imaging systems for the commercial market 
the results of agema s operations have been combined with those of the company since the date of acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition  during the quarter ended december   the company recognized a one time charge of million 
the write off consisted of million of in process research and development and acquisition related costs  which are included as a separate line in operating expenses  and million of inventories due to the creation of duplicative product lines  which is included in cost of goods sold 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million compared with  at december  additionally  at december   the company had million drawn on its lines of credit 
working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the increased utilization of the lines of credit due to increases in accounts receivable discussed below  increase in liabilities assumed related to the agema acquisition and cash required for the expanded operations 
at december   the company had million in accounts receivable outstanding compared to million at december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the addition of receivables related to agema operations and the increase in revenue 
days sales outstanding increased from days at december  to days at december  this increase was primarily a result of the acquisition of agema  as the company acquired all the receivables of agema but has only included its operations from december   through december  had the company included the operations of agema for all of  days sales outstanding would have decreased to days 
the company generally experiences long collection cycles due to a variety of factors  including payment terms required by foreign governmental customers as well as payment terms for companies that integrate the company s products into aircraft for sale to ultimate users 
the company believes that with the inclusion of agema s operations and ongoing collection efforts  days sales outstanding will continue to decline as revenue increases and as commercial revenue  which generally have a shorter collection cycle  continues to become a larger percentage of overall revenue 
at december   the company had inventories on hand aggregating million compared to million at december  the slight increase in the inventory level was principally due to the inclusion of inventory of agema  an increase in components related to anticipated deliveries of safire tm systems to the us government and international customers  and an increase in inventories to support deliveries of new products including the ultramedia tm  the ultramedia rs tm and the tracer tm 
these increases were somewhat offset as a result of the million write off of duplicative inventories discussed above 
additionally  inventory levels at the company s united kingdom manufacturing operation continue to increase in anticipation of future deliveries under existing contracts 
because of the extremely long lead times for many of the company s most expensive components  it is necessary to have inventory on hand to meet the required delivery schedule 
the company maintains levels of inventory sufficient to satisfy backlog which the company considers to be firm and to respond to short term delivery requirements for a majority of its products 
management believes its ability to provide prompt deliveries gives the company a competitive advantage for certain sales 
it is expected that the current inventory levels will be maintained or decrease slightly 
the company has available approximately million in lines of credit which bear interest at rates from to and are collateralized by all assets of the company 
at december   the company had a balance of million drawn on these lines of credit compared to a million balance on these lines at december  the company believes that its existing cash  cash generated from operations  and available credit facilities together with scheduled collections on existing receivable balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future
