item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction death care businesses in the united states traditionally have been relatively small family owned enterprises transferred to successive generations within the family 
the industry in the united states  and in certain foreign countries  is undergoing a transition in which family owned firms are consolidating with larger organizations  such as the company 
although the company s future participation in this consolidation cannot be guaranteed  the company believes that it has been successful in identifying and acquiring firms that have enhanced shareholder value  and it will continue to explore expansion opportunities  both domestically and internationally  although it expects most of its expansion to continue to occur within the united states 
two other trends affecting the death care industry are the death rate and average age of the population 
industry studies indicate that while the death rate is declining slightly  the average age of the population is increasing 
this is expected to result in a long term  small  though stable  increase in the number of deaths  despite short term deviations 
more importantly  because of the company s emphasis on prearranged sales  management anticipates that the aging of the population will create additional opportunities for the company to expand its customer base and secure a portion of its future market share  since the principal market for these prearranged services is the more mature and fastest growing segment of the population

see cautionary statements 
the discussion herein should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
change in accounting principles effective november   the company changed accounting principles for prearranged funeral and cemetery sales  as follows i the company now defers a portion of the earnings realized by irrevocable prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts in order to offset the estimated effects of inflation on the future cost of performing prearranged funeral services  ii the company now records all revenues and costs attributable to prearranged sales of cemetery interment rights and related products at the time the contract is signed  and iii the company now records revenue and related costs attributable to cemetery burial site openings and closings at the time of sale 
the accounting changes were made principally to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses in the appropriate periods and to more accurately reflect the company s operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these changes generally will result in reduced near term funeral revenue and gross profit  due to the deferral of a portion of the earnings from funeral trust funds and escrow accounts until the funeral is performed 
these changes also will result in higher near term cemetery revenue and gross profit  due to the recognition under the accrual basis of accounting of certain cemetery sales 
the net effect is expected to result in increased revenues and gross profit from amounts that would have been reported under the company s previous accounting methods 
trust and escrow investments the company s funeral and cemetery business includes prearranged sales funded through trust and escrow arrangements  as well as maintenance of cemetery grounds funded through perpetual care funds 
the company s investment strategy for these funds is  among other criteria  partially dependent on the ability to withdraw net realized capital gains from these funds 
however  withdrawal of capital gains is not permitted for perpetual care funds in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  funds for which net capital gains are permitted to be withdrawn typically are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting principally of us government securities  other interest bearing securities and preferred stocks rated a or better  publicly traded common stocks  money market funds and other short term investments 
the company generally recognizes as revenue on a current basis from trust funds and escrow accounts all dividends  interest and net realized capital gains in excess of the amount to be deferred to offset expected increases in the future costs of performing prearranged funeral services 
the composition of trust and escrow income from funds  especially those including common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing its north american funds  including those in puerto rico and excluding those in mexico  which include investments in common stock  the company seeks an overall annual rate of return of approximately 
in the past three years  such funds have generated overall annual rates of return that approximate that amount 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving any particular rate of return

the decline in revenue was offset partially by a increase in average revenue per funeral service performed due principally to price increases and improved merchandising

the million  or  increase in revenue from existing operations  and the million  or  increase in costs from existing operations were due principally to the significant decrease in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  in the revenue and direct cost deferral required by the accounting principles prescribed for sales of real estate 
these factors and others  including certain cost control measures implemented by the company  contributed to an increase in the profit margin of existing operations 
the increase in revenues and costs associated with acquired operations resulted primarily from the acquisition of cemeteries during fiscal year which is not reflected in the period presented above 
the million increase in revenue from merchandise trust funds and escrow accounts was attributable principally to a growth in the average balance in the merchandise trust funds and escrow accounts  resulting primarily from current year payments deposited into the funds  along with funds added through acquisitions  coupled with an increase in the return on the funds  which return is still within the company s goal of

in december  the company issued million of those debt securities in the form of notes due net proceeds were approximately million  of which million was used to reduce balances outstanding under the company s revolving credit facilities  with the remaining million used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
in april  the company completed the syndication of a new million revolving credit facility  which replaced its existing million  million and million revolving credit facilities 
as of october   million was outstanding under this facility  with an average interest rate of long term debt as of october  amounted to million  compared to million as of october  the company s long term debt consisted of million under the company s revolving credit facilities  mill ion of long term notes and million of term notes incurred principally in connection with the acquisition of funeral home and cemetery properties

management expects that future capital requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated cash flow and amounts available under its revolving credit facilities 
additional debt and equity financing may be required in connection with future acquisitions 
in addition  the company monitors its mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and may from time to time decide to alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under its floating rate revolving credit facility with public or private fixed rate debt  or by entering into interest rate swaps or similar interest rate hedging transactions 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s united states operations over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
the mexican economy  however  currently is experiencing inflation rates substantially in excess of those in the united states 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company changed its method of reporting foreign currency translation adjustments for its mexican operations to the method prescribed for highly inflationary economies 
under that method  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations  instead of in shareholders equity 
this change did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for fiscal year other in  the company began to modify its computer software programs to enable them to correctly process dates for the year project completion is planned for early spring at an estimated cost of  using both internal and external resources

forward looking statements certain statements made herein or elsewhere by  or on behalf of  the company that are not historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s goals for fiscal year include i revenue growth of at least  and ii earnings per share growth of 
the company also projects approximately million in acquisitions  which represents a slight increase over the million  million  and million achieved in fiscal years   and  respectively 
for fiscal year  the company projects gross margin improvement of approximately to basis points over its fiscal year gross margin 
the company s strategic plan for the future includes the following goals i achievement of billion in revenue by fiscal year  and ii earnings per share growth of annually 
forward looking statements are based on assumptions about future events and are therefore inherently uncertain  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
see cautionary statements  below 
cautionary statements the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual consolidated results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the projections made in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
achieving projected revenue growth depends in part upon sustaining the level of acquisition activity experienced by the company in the last three fiscal years 
higher levels of acquisition activity will increase anticipated revenues  and lower levels of acquisition activity will decrease anticipated revenues 
the level of acquisition activity depends not only on the number of properties acquired  but also on the size of the acquisitions  for example  one large acquisition could increase substantially the level of acquisition activity and  consequently  revenues 
several important factors  among others  affect the company s ability to consummate acquisitions a the company may be unable to find a sufficient number of businesses for sale at prices the company is willing to pay 
b in most of its existing markets and in many new markets  including foreign markets  that the company desires to enter  the company competes for acquisitions with the other publicly traded death care firms 
these competitors  and others  may be willing to pay higher prices for businesses than the company or may cause the company to pay more to acquire a business than the company would otherwise have to pay in the absence of such competition 
thus  the aggress iveness of the company s competitors in pricing acquisitions affects the company s ability to complete acquisitions at prices it finds attractive 
c achieving the company s projected acquisition activity depends on the company s ability to enter new markets  including foreign markets 
due in part to the company s lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than the company  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated by the company 
the level of revenues also is affected by the volume and prices of the properties  products and services sold 
the annual sales targets set by the company are very aggressive  and the inability of the company to achieve planned increases in volume or prices could cause the company not to meet anticipated levels of revenue 
the ability of the company to achieve volume or price increases at any location depends on numerous factors  including the local economy  the local death rate and competition 
another important component of revenue is earnings from the company s trust funds and escrow accounts  which are determined by the size of  and returns which include dividends  interest and realized capital gains on  the funds 
the performance of the funds is related primarily to market conditions that are not within the company s control 
the size of the funds depends on the level of sales  funds added through acquisitions and the amount of returns that may be reinvested 
future revenue also is affected by the level of prearranged sales in prior periods 
the level of prearranged sales may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including deterioration in the economy  which causes individuals to have less discretionary income 
the company cannot predict whether or when a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million may be required in connection with its performance based stock options 
see incentive compensation plan in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item the company first entered foreign markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be successful in expanding in foreign markets  or that any expansion in foreign markets will yield results comparable to those realized as a result of the company s expansion in the united states 
in addition to the factors discussed above  earnings per share may be affected by other important factors  including the following a the ability of the company to achieve projected economies of scale in markets where it has clusters or combined facilities 
b whether acquired businesses perform at pro forma levels used by management in the valuation process and whether  and the rate at which  management is able to increase the profitability of acquired businesses 
c the ability of the company to manage its growth in terms of imple menting internal controls and information gathering systems  and retaining or attracting key personnel  among other things 
d the amount and rate of growth in the company s corporate general and administrative expenses 
e changes in interest rates  which can increase or decrease the amount the company pays on borrowings with variable rates of interest 
f the company s debt to equity ratio  the number of shares of common stock outstanding and the portion of the company s debt that has fixed or variable interest rates 
g the impact on the company s financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from the company s ongoing evaluation of its business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures 
h changes in government regulation  including tax rates and structures 
i unanticipated outcomes of legal proceedings 
j changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or required to be adopted by generally accepted accounting principles 
the company also cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company
