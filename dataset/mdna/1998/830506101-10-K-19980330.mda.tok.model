item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition general skaneateles bancorp  inc the company is a bank holding company  with skaneateles savings bank the bank being its sole subsidiary 
the financial condition and operating results of the company are largely dependent on the bank  its primary investment 
certain statements in this discussion are forward looking 
these may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases  such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  planned  estimated  and potential 
these forward looking statements are based on the company s current expectations 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for such statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
among the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance and results of the business of the company and the bank are prevailing market rates of interest for both loans and deposits  loan prepayments by  and the financial health of  the bank s borrowers  general economic conditions in the bank s designated lending area  and competition from banks and other financial institutions with greater resources operating in the bank s marketplace 
total assets were million at december   compared with million at december   an increase of million  or 
net loans increased million and cash and federal funds sold increased million in total assets millions of dollars loans net loans were million at december   an increase of million  or from december  loan originations for totaled million  a decrease of from s originations of million 
substantial increases in both consumer and commercial loan originations were offset by a decrease in residential lending 
net loans millions of dollars residential mortgage originations were million in  a decrease of from s originations 
residential mortgages represented of s total loan originations  down from in as a result of increasing competition in mortgage lending  which squeezed margins and profitability  the bank shifted its lending focus late in  placing more emphasis on consumer and commercial loans 
to that end  the bank effectively suspended the use of mortgage brokers  who had been used to supplement the bank s direct originations  especially outside of the bank s designated lending area 
accordingly  as expected  residential mortgage originations dropped significantly in approximately million  or of the residential loans originated in were for fixed rates of interest  compared with million and  respectively  in prior to january   fixed rate mortgages with terms of years or less were originated for portfolio 
beginning in january   the bank began selling all conforming fixed rate mortgages at the time of origination due to the relatively low interest rate environment and the resulting increased interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate assets 
consumer loan originations were million  or of total loan originations in  compared with million  or in the bank has seen a substantial increase in deposit customers through its checking account marketing program champ 
cross sales of consumer loan products to these new customers was a significant factor behind the loan growth in the champ program is a long term marketing program  and cross selling to new customers obtained through the program is expected to be an important component of consumer loan growth in future years 
also contributing to the increase in consumer loan originations is the bank s indirect lending program  begun in january   along with its dealer floor plan program 
through the indirect program  the bank receives consumer loan applications from bank approved automobile  boat and recreational vehicle dealerships on behalf of their customers to finance their purchases 
these applications are subject to the bank s normal consumer loan underwriting criteria 
indirect consumer loans accounted for approximately of the bank s total consumer loan originations in commercial loan and mortgage originations were million  or of total loan originations in  up from million  or in the increase resulted largely from the bank s dealer floor plan program begun in january  through the program  the bank provides lines of credit to local boat  automobile  and recreational vehicle dealers to finance inventory purchases 
at december   total outstanding balances on dealer floor plans was million 
deposits deposit growth was the primary source of funds for the bank in total deposits  including escrow  were million at december   an increase of million  or from the end of the bank experienced an increase of million in december alone  at least half of which were short term increases in personal and commercial demand accounts which were withdrawn in january deposits millions of dollars the bank s strategy for deposit growth is focused on savings and checking accounts  which carry lower rates of interest than time accounts and tend to be less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the bank offers seven checking account products  each targeted to specific demographic groups and supported by an active direct mail marketing campaign champ 
total checking account balances increased million  or in  on top of a million or increase in excluding accounts acquired from cicero bank 
the bank opened more than  new checking accounts in as a result of the champ program 
savings account balances increased million  or in  compared with an increase of million or in excluding accounts acquired from cicero bank 
the gains resulted primarily from cross sales to new checking account customers 
the champ program will be a key part of the bank s deposit growth strategy for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the lower interest cost of these deposits  the accounts generate fee income which will provide a stable source of revenue regardless of fluctuations in interest rates 
also  the increase in checking account customers provides a significant opportunity to cross sell other deposit and loan products 
time certificates of deposit totaled million at december   compared with million at the end of the bank generally kept its rates on time certificates at or slightly above the average rates in its market area during the bank expects to continue this practice in premium rates may be offered from time to time for specific branch promotions or in the event loan demand so justifies 
asset quality nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned reo 
management s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status with respect to interest income recognition when collection of the interest is doubtful 
generally  this occurs when principal or interest payments are ninety days or more past due  although interest accruals may continue for certain loans that are adequately secured 
the classification of a loan as nonaccruing does not necessarily indicate that the principal and interest ultimately will be uncollectible 
the bank s historical experience suggests that a portion of assets so classified will eventually be recovered 
all nonperforming loans are in various stages of workout  settlement or foreclosure 
nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets at december   compared with million  or of total assets at december  included in nonperforming assets at december  were nonaccrual loans of million  or of gross loans  compared with million  or of gross loans at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december  compared with million at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was at december   compared with at the end of loan loss provisions totaled  in  compared with  in the loan loss provision was increased to reflect the higher credit risk inherent in consumer and commercial lending 
charge offs  net of recoveries amounted to  in  compared with million in the bank charged off  on one commercial loan in in  the bank accepted approximately  in full settlement of this debt  of which  was recorded as a recovery to the allowance for loan losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly  and is determined primarily by management s informed judgment concerning the amount of risk inherent in the portfolio 
management s judgment is based upon a number of factors including historical loan loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  estimated value of underlying collateral  industry and geographic concentrations  and current and prospective economic conditions 
the bank utilizes a risk rating system in its credit quality estimation process 
this system involves an ongoing review of business loans and commercial real estate loans that culminates in loans being assigned a risk rating based upon various credit criteria 
if the review indicates a sufficient level of risk  an allowance is established proportionate to the perceived risk for each loan 
loans not having an individually established allowance are aggregated by the type of loan and an allowance is estimated based upon aging statistics  past experience and economic factors 
generally  all commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans in a delinquent payment status days or more delinquent are considered impaired 
the bank estimates losses on impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
an impairment loss exists if the recorded investment in a loan exceeds the value of the loan as measured by the aforementioned methods 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  home equity lines of credit and education loans  respectively  are evaluated collectively since they are homogenous and generally carry smaller individual balances 
as with any financial institution  poor economic conditions  high interest rates  high unemployment and other matters outside of the bank s control may lead to increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management has various controls in place designed in an effort to limit losses  such as a comprehensive watch list of possible loan problems  a fully documented policy concerning loan administration loan file documentation  disclosures  approvals  etc 
and a loan review function to audit for adherence to established bank controls and to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
loan review reports are presented monthly to the executive committee of the board of directors  which in turn  reports to the full board of directors 
the power to authorize charge offs rests solely with the board of directors 
management believes the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate based upon the quality of the loan portfolio at that date 
future additions to the allowance will be based  among other factors  on changes in economic conditions and financial stress of the company s borrowers 
asset liability management the goal of asset liability management is to reduce the volatility of net interest income during periods of changing market interest rates interest rate risk 
the company uses three methods to measure its interest rate risk gap  income simulation  and market value of equity analysis 
gap analysis measures the difference between assets and liabilities which reprice and or mature within a given time frame  typically the cumulative one year horizon 
an asset sensitive gap position could lead to an increase in net interest income in a rising rate environment  and a decrease in net interest income in a falling rate environment  as assets reprice or mature quicker than liabilities 
conversely  a liability sensitive gap position could lead to a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment and an increase in net interest income in a falling rate environment 
income simulation measures the potential impact on net interest income of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
market value of equity analysis measures the potential impact on stockholders equity of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
in february  the bank purchased an interest rate floor with a notional amount of million  to hedge a portion of its prime based loan portfolio 
under the agreement  which expires in february  the bank will receive payments on a quarterly basis if the prime rate drops below the strike rate 
payments are equal to the amount by which the prime rate falls below the strike rate multiplied by the notional amount of the floor 
the fee paid for the floor is included in other assets and is being amortized to interest income using the interest method over the life of the floor 
the company s cumulative one year ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities one year gap was at december  stockholders equity stockholders equity totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the change is the result of net income of million  proceeds of  from issuance of stock under stock plans  cash dividends of  and a  increase in the fair value of securities  net of taxes 
the company s and bank s tier i capital to average assets ratio was at december  compared with at december  total capital to risk weighted assets was and  respectively  at december  and both capital measurements exceed the regulatory requirements of and  respectively  to be classified as a well capitalized institution 
liquidity and capital resources the purpose of liquidity management is to assure sufficient cash flow to meet all of the company s financial requirements and to be able to capitalize on opportunities for increasing income 
liquidity is mainly provided by cash  securities available for sale  principal and interest collections on loans and mortgage backed securities  deposits and borrowing facilities from correspondent banks 
the bank has overnight line of credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb totaling million which can be used to meet the bank s daily cash needs 
in addition  the bank can borrow additional amounts on a term basis from the fhlb 
the company s liquidity position is monitored daily  and the asset liability committee is responsible for setting general guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
at the end of  the bank s approved commitments to extend credit amounted to million 
further information on commitments is in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s liquidity is considered adequate to meet all of its cash flow requirements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  general the company s and bank s earnings are largely dependent upon net interest income  and are also affected by its provision for loan losses  other operating income and expenses  and taxes 
all earnings per share information reflects a three for two stock split on november   and is calculated assuming dilution pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share 
net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in a million increase in net interest income and a  increase in other operating income was partially offset by a  increase in loan loss provisions and a  increase in other expenses 
income taxes increased  net income thousands of dollars    net interest income net interest income is affected by the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relative amounts of interest earning assets  deposits  and borrowings also impact net interest income levels 
net interest income was million in  an increase of million  or from interest income increased million  or in due to a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the yield on those assets 
total average loans increased million  or while securities and federal funds sold decreased million  or 
the yield on loans was in  compared with in the increase was due mainly to a million  or increase in the average balance of other loans consumer and commercial  which yielded in interest rates were  on average  little changed between and the bank s prime rate  which is directly impacted by movements in short term rates by the federal reserve  averaged in  compared with in treasury yields on maturities of years or less increased on average less than basis points  while yields were down slightly on longer maturities 
interest expense increased  or in due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
the bank s deposit mix continued to change in due to the bank s strategy of emphasizing and promoting savings and checking accounts 
average transaction accounts savings  demand and now accounts as a percentage of total average deposits including escrow were in  compared with in the average cost of transaction accounts was in  while the average cost of time deposits was 
market interest rates alone do not dictate the rates the bank pays for its funds  although they are an important factor 
other factors that impact the bank s cost of funds include liquidity needs  the desired mix of deposits and borrowings  local market competition and asset growth objectives 
the net interest margin  which is computed by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets  increased to in  compared with in net interest margin the company s net interest margin is expected to come under pressure in due to the flattening of the treasury market yield curve 
like any financial institution  the bank experiences some level of prepayments in its loan portfolio each year  particularly in its mortgage portfolio 
however  the historically low level of long term rates will likely result in an increase in prepayments due to loan refinancings in  which could result in lower yields to the bank on the amount of loans refinanced 
analysis of net interest income the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the total dollar amount of interest income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average cost  net interest income  interest rate spread  net interest earning assets  net yield on interest earning assets  and ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 
nonaccruing loans  which are immaterial  have been included in interest earning assets

other operating expenses other operating expenses were million in  compared with million in  an increase of  or 
the increase in expenses was primarily growth related 
salaries and employee benefits expense was million in  compared with million in  an increase of  or 
most of the increase is attributable to a full year of salary expense in for employees of the cicero bank branch that was acquired on july   and the hiring of new full time equivalent employees to staff the new north medical branch  which opened in september  the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from salary adjustments and incentive bonuses 
building  occupancy and equipment expense increased  or due primarily to a full year of depreciation and maintenance in on the branch acquired from cicero bank and to four months of expense on the north medical branch 
data processing and correspondent bank fees increased a combined  or in due primarily to transaction processing costs on the bank s larger deposit base

the bank is more actively marketing its real estate owned  and for this reason expects that additional losses may be incurred in in order to facilitate a quicker disposal of the properties 
the company s efficiency ratio was in  down from in the efficiency ratio is equal to total operating expenses net of real estate owned expense and amortization of intangibles divided by net interest income plus other operating income 
the improvement in the efficiency ratio was driven by growth in net interest income and other operating income exceeding the increase in operating expenses 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
was adopted by the company in the statement requires that a valuation allowance be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company recognized no immediate financial statement effect from adopting statement no 
because a valuation allowance was provided on the deferred tax asset 
the company generated sufficient earnings from through to enable it to reduce the valuation allowance through credits to the income tax provision in  which resulted in an effective tax rate less than the statutory rates for the company recorded income tax expense of  in  compared with  in the company s effective tax rate is projected to be approximately in year ended december  compared to year ended december  general net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million or

loans acquired from cicero bank  consisting primarily of consumer and commercial loans  accounted for approximately million of the increase in average balances 
the rest of the increase in average interest earning assets resulted from new loan originations during the year 
asset yields were generally down in due to a slightly lower interest rate environment compared with  as well as to competitive pressures in the bank s local lending area 
yields on other loans are heavily influenced by home equity lines of credit and commercial loans which generally carry a variable rate of interest tied to the bank s prime rate

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements presented in the annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
measurement of financial position and operating results have been made in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative purchasing power of money due to inflation are not reflected 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  thus banks are more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily reflect the direction or magnitude of changes in the price of goods and services which are primarily affected by inflation 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are of major importance in maintaining acceptable levels of performance 
recently issued accounting standards effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  except for those transactions governed by sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of fasb statement no

it distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas no 
deferred for one year the effective date of sfas no 
as it relates to transfers of financial assets and secured borrowing and collateral 
the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company adopted the provisions of statement no 
 earnings per share 
the statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps for entities with publicly held common stock and common stock equivalents 
all prior period eps amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and in the company s annual report have been restated to conform with the provisions of statement no 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
entitled reporting comprehensive income 
the statement establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources 
statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes 
the company has not yet determined the impact of statement on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb also issued statement no 
entitled disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the statement requires publicly held companies to report financial and other information about operating segments 
a reconciliation of segment financial information to amounts reported in the financial statements would be provided 
statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  and comparative information for earlier years is to be restated 
at the present time  the effect of adopting the statement  if any  has not been determined 
year issue the year issue stems from date coding practices in both software and hardware 
specifically  hardware and software developers have often used two digit numbers rather than four digit numbers to represent years 
this was done in a conscious effort to provide cost effective and efficient business solutions  given resource constraints and requirements in the past 
consequently  when the year turns to  the software may calculate the date as because the century has not been defined 
management has initiated an enterprise wide program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for the year the company expects to incur internal staffing costs as well as consulting and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare the systems for the year the company is expending significant resources to assure that its computer systems are reprogrammed in time to effectively deal with transactions in the year and beyond 
we expect to spend as much as  in order to get the bank s systems ready for processing in the year much of this outlay will be for new computer equipment and a new core data processing system  which will be capitalized and amortized over three years 
the core system being considered is a state of the art  in house  client server based system 
in addition to being year ready  the new processing system will result in immediate cost savings compared with our existing outsourced legacy system 
the company does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next two years to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
cost savings from the new system are expected to completely offset the entire  expenditure within years 
the amount expensed in was immaterial 
the year problem creates risk for the company from both unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from problems in the computer systems of third parties with whom the company deals on financial transactions 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company expects its year date conversion project to be completed on a timely basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely also will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems
