item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
timber and wood products rayonier s timber and wood products business segment is composed of three principal lines of business trading and merchandising  timberlands management and wood products 
sales for the last three years by principal line of business were as follows in millions of dollars sales revenue trading and merchandising timberlands management wood products intrasegment eliminations total trading and merchandising rayonier is a leading exporter and trader of softwood logs  lumber and wood panel products 
rayonier purchases and harvests timber and purchases lumber and wood panel products for sale in domestic and export markets 
in  percent of new zealand log sales volume was sourced from company timberlands 
in north america  percent of log sales volume was sourced from rayonier s timberlands  however  logs also were purchased from local dealers who had  in some cases  purchased their cutting rights from company managed timberlands 
timberlands management rayonier manages approximately million acres of timberlands as of december  as follows in s fee long term region total acres owned acres leased acres southeast us northwest us new zealand total   rayonier manages timberlands  scientifically developing forests until their economic peak for specific markets 
the average rotation age for timber from the southeastern us primarily southern pine is years for timber sold to sawmills and years for pulpwood destined for pulp and paper mills 
the average rotation age for timber destined for domestic and export markets from the northwestern us primarily hemlock and douglas fir species is years 
the average rotation age for timber grown in new zealand primarily radiata pine is years 
timberlands management is organized to regularly sell timber through auction processes predominately to third parties 
by requiring the company s other business sectors eg  specialty pulp products  wood products and trading and merchandising to competitively bid on the timber  the company believes it can maximize the true economic return on its investments 
the company manages its timberlands on a sustainable yield basis in conformity with best forest industry practices 
a key to success is the extensive application of rayonier s silvicultural expertise to species selection for plantations  soil preparation  thinning of timber stands  pruning of selected species  fertilization and careful timing of the harvest  all designed to maximize value  while responding to environmental needs 
the following table sets forth timberlands management acres by region and by timber classification in s softwood hardwood region plantation lands non forest total southeast us northwest us new zealand total   excludes thousand acres managed by rayonier under joint ventures and approximately thousand acres of native bush estate that is not harvestable 
the following table sets forth the estimated volumes of merchantable timber by location and type  as of december  equivalent total  in thousands region softwood hardwood total of cubic meters southeast us  in thousands of short green tons     northwest us  in millions of board feet    new zealand  in thousands of cubic meters    merchantable timber inventory is an estimate of the amount of standing timber at the earliest age that  under varying economic conditions  could be harvested 
estimates are based on a continuing inventory system  which involves periodic statistical sampling of the timberlands  with adjustments made on the basis of growth estimates  harvest information and market conditions 
southeastern us timberlands are located primarily in georgia and florida 
their proximity to pulp  paper and lumber mills results in significant competition for the purchase of rayonier s timber 
approximately percent of the timber harvest is pulpwood  which is destined for pulp and paper mills  with the remaining percent representing higher value timber sold primarily to plywood and lumber mills 
over the last five years the company  through advanced silvicultural practices  has been able to increase the amount of timber volume per acre available for harvest from its southeastern timberlands by approximately percent per year and expects this trend to continue 
northwestern us timberlands are located primarily on the olympic peninsula in washington state  are all owned in fee and consist almost entirely of second growth trees 
these timberlands include softwood stands  of which approximately percent is hemlock and percent is douglas fir  western red cedar and spruce  and hardwood timber stands  consisting principally of alder and maple 
new zealand forest assets consist primarily of crown forest licenses providing the right to utilize approximately  acres of new zealand plantation forests for a minimum period of years 
approximately percent of these timberlands consist of radiata pine trees  well suited for high quality lumber and panel products 
the trees typically produce up to twice as much fiber per acre  per year as the most productive commercial tree species in the united states 
the remaining percent is douglas fir and other species 
rayonier grows new zealand timber for both domestic new zealand uses and for export primarily to the pacific rim markets 
in addition  rayonier new zealand manages timberlands for others  principally joint ventures in which rayonier holds a minority interest 
wood products rayonier s lumber mills located at baxley and swainsboro  ga  convert southern pine timber into dimension and specialty lumber products for residential construction and industrial uses 
the two mills have a combined annual capacity of approximately million board feet of lumber and approximately  tons of wood chips for pulping 
the mills sell their lumber output primarily in southeastern united states and caribbean markets 
substantially all of the wood chip production is sold at market price to rayonier s jesup  ga pulp facility accounting for approximately percent of jesup s pine chip consumption 
a third lumber manufacturing facility  located in plummer  id  has annual capacity of million board feet 
lumber is sold primarily by rayonier sales personnel  although sales to certain export locations are made through independent sales agents 
in the third quarter of  the company completed construction of a million medium density fiberboard mdf facility in new zealand with an annual capacity of  cubic meters and utilities infrastructure capacity for an additional  cubic meters 
the company markets its mdf in new zealand through an exclusive marketing arrangement with a third party 
internationally  the company s premium grade patinna tm brand mdf is marketed by rayonier personnel and independent sales agents 
specialty pulp products rayonier is a leading specialty pulp manufacturer 
the company owns and operates pulp mills at jesup  ga  and fernandina beach  fl  with an annual capacity of  metric tons 
rayonier s facilities are able to manufacture more than different grades of pulp to meet customers needs 
the jesup facility produces approximately  metric tons of wood pulp  or percent of rayonier s total capacity 
the fernandina beach facility produces approximately  metric tons of wood pulp  or percent of rayonier s total capacity 
sales for the last three years for the jesup and fernandina beach mills by principal line of business were as follows millions of dollars sales revenue chemical cellulose fluff and specialty paper pulps total rayonier concentrates on the production of specialty pulps to customers specifications  sold to industrial companies producing a wide variety of products 
over half of rayonier s pulp sales are to export customers  primarily in europe  asia and latin america 
over percent of specialty pulp sales are made directly by rayonier sales personnel 
in certain of the company s export locations  sales are made through independent sales agents 
chemical cellulose rayonier is one of the world s leading producers of chemical cellulose  also called dissolving pulp  which is a highly purified form of pulp 
chemical cellulose is used in a wide variety of products such as textile fibers  rigid packaging  photographic film  impact resistant plastics  high tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics  detergents  sausage casings  food products  thickeners for oil well drilling muds  cigarette filters  lacquers  paints  printing inks and explosives 
within the chemical cellulose industry  rayonier concentrates on the most highly valued  technologically demanding end uses  such as cellulose acetate and high purity cellulose ethers where it is a leading supplier 
fluff and specialty paper pulps rayonier is a leading supplier of fluff pulp  used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers  personal sanitary napkins  incontinence pads  convalescent bed pads  industrial towels and wipes and non woven fabrics 
rayonier also is a major producer of specialty paper pulps and produces only a small volume of regular paper pulp 
customers use rayonier s specialty paper pulps to manufacture paper for decorative laminates for counter tops  air and oil filters  shoe innersoles  battery separators  circuit boards and filter media for the food industry 
paper pulp  representing approximately percent of total company pulp sales  is used in the manufacture of bond  book and printing paper 
pulp pricing pulp prices are cyclical 
since rayonier is a non integrated specialty pulp producer for non paper making end uses  pricing of its high value product mix tends to lag on both the upturn and downturn commodity paper pulp prices 
foreign sales and operations rayonier s sales for the last three years by point of destination are as follows millions of dollars sales by destination united states europe japan korea china other asia latin america canada all other total    overseas assets  primarily in new zealand  were percent of total assets at the end of and rayonier s sales from non us sources were percent of total sales

environmental matters see environmental regulation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
raw materials regional timber availability continues to be restricted by legislation  litigation and pressure from various preservationist groups and is also subject to cyclical swings in lumber and paper and pulp markets 
while the timberlands management business has benefited from a significant increase in timber prices over the last decade  this increase also adversely impacted fiber costs at rayonier s pulp and lumber manufacturing facilities 
rayonier has pursued  and is continuing to pursue  reductions in usage and costs of key raw materials  supplies and contract services at the company s pulp and lumber mills 
management foresees no significant constraints from pricing or availability of its key raw materials

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment information the amounts and relative contributions to sales and operating income attributable to each of rayonier s business segments for each of the three years ended december  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december sales timber and wood products trading and merchandising timberlands management wood products intrasegment eliminations total timber and wood products specialty pulp products chemical cellulose fluff and specialty paper pulps total specialty pulp products intersegment eliminations total before dispositions    dispositions total sales    operating income timber and wood products specialty pulp products corporate and other total before dispositions dispositions total operating income business conditions rayonier s net income was million  or per share  compared to net income  excluding significant non recurring items  of million  or per share 
the results include a non operating gain of million million after tax  or cents per share related to the sale of an interest in new zealand timber assets 
the improved results also reflect the absence of losses from the now closed port angeles pulp mill  stronger lumber markets  lower minority interest  lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate 
rayonier s overall operating results are somewhat cyclical and driven by international economic factors 
in  approximately percent of rayonier sales were made to customers outside the us  down from percent in lower export sales following closure of the port angeles pulp mill on february   contributed to the reduction 
in addition  weak asian economies  together with a strengthening us dollar  further reduced sales prices and volume on timber and log sales from the northwest us and new zealand 
relatively high worldwide market pulp inventories during most of resulted in lower average pulp prices than in in january  the company acquired the outstanding publicly traded minority interest in rayonier timberlands  lp rtlp or the partnership  a master limited partnership that owned and operated most of its us timberlands business 
as a result of the acquisition  rayonier expects to recognize approximately cents to cents per share of incremental net income in based on its current perception of markets for timber harvested from the partnership s timberlands 
a strategic assessment of the company s specialty pulp business was completed early in actions are underway to implement several significant profit improvement opportunities that were identified 
pulp production costs declined in as operating efficiency improved and certain key raw material and service costs fell 
these general trends are expected to continue during rayonier s capital spending in and was focused on expansion of its new zealand operations  quality and productivity improvements in specialty pulp products and acquisitions and growth in the timber and wood products businesses 
these investments are expected to help moderate the cyclical effects of the pulp market cycle  improve bottom of the cycle earnings and add value to existing assets 
see liquidity and capital resources 
during the fourth quarter of and early  weakness in asian markets placed additional price pressure on worldwide pulp markets  as well as timber and log markets in new zealand and the northwest us partially offsetting these effects are lower costs for many of the company s raw materials  benefits from a lower new zealand currency and a strong domestic us market 
the company also is redirecting its marketing efforts toward stronger economies in north america  europe and latin america 
unusually wet weather in the southeast us during the fourth quarter of and early is expected to raise southeast us fiber costs for both pulp and lumber facilities  which will affect results in the adverse impact of higher wood costs will be partially offset by increased prices for the company s southeast us timber 
results of operations  vs 
sales and operating income sales declined percent to billion in  reflecting the closure of the port angeles pulp mill on february   lower north american log trading volume and export prices  lower new zealand log volume and lower northwest us timber selling prices  partially offset by higher lumber selling prices and volume 
operating income for the year was million  rising from million in  due to the absence of the disposition charge of million and operating losses associated with the port angeles pulp mill  and higher lumber selling prices and volume 
timber and wood products sales of timber and wood products declined percent to million  while operating income declined percent to million 
lower northwest us timber prices and new zealand timber volume were partially offset by strong us lumber selling prices and volume and favorable new zealand exchange rates 
trading and merchandising sales were million compared to million in the percent decline was primarily due to weakness in asian wood markets  resulting in lower log prices and volume 
although sales declined  operating income improved slightly  principally due to favorable new zealand exchange rates and margins 
timberlands management sales of million decreased percent from  and operating income declined primarily due to weaker northwest us timber prices 
southeast us timber volume improved due to a strong pulpwood market 
wood products sales increased percent to million in due to stronger us lumber sales volume and prices and start up of the medium density fiberboard mdf business in new zealand 
wood products operating income improved from due to higher lumber prices and volumes and lower conversion costs 
the significant improvements experienced in lumber were partially offset by operating losses incurred in connection with the start up of the new zealand mdf business  as the company increased production to commercial levels and developed markets in the pacific rim and europe for its premium quality patinna tm brand 
operating losses from the mdf business are expected to continue in specialty pulp products sales of million for the company s jesup and fernandina pulp mills were slightly above the prior year level with lower selling prices more than offset by higher volume 
operating income of million was million below last year as lower average selling prices for both chemical cellulose and fluff pulp were mostly offset by higher pulp shipments and lower manufacturing costs 
pulp production costs declined to per ton in from in intersegment intersegment sales of million in were less than the million recorded in due to lower log sales from the timber and wood products segment to the specialty pulp products segment 
dispositions dispositions results include the company s port angeles pulp mill  permanently closed in february  with product sales arising from inventory 
improved results over primarily reflect the absence of operating losses following the mill s closure 
sales were million in compared to million in  and operating income in was million compared to an operating loss in of million  excluding closure charges 
other income expense interest expense for decreased million to million reflecting lower average debt levels primarily due to reduced investment in working capital 
capitalized interest relating to the company s new zealand mdf facility was million in compared to million in rayonier purchases forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of new zealand us dollar exchange fluctuations on operating results 
the mark to market loss on these contracts included in interest and miscellaneous expense income  net  was million in  as compared to a mark to market gain of million in in the movement of the new zealand us dollar exchange rate from on january   to on december   had a favorable effect of million on the company s new zealand operating income  as compared to a negative impact of million in when the new zealand currency strengthened 
from time to time the company opportunistically sells non strategic assets to maximize value from its asset mix 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold a percent interest in two new zealand forests  acres to a timber investment fund and purchased a percent stake in two other new zealand forests  acres from the same fund in a transaction that resulted in net cash proceeds to the company of million 
as a result  a pretax gain of million  million after tax  or cents per share  was realized 
rayonier has management and marketing responsibilities for the joint venture  which involves  acres of timber on new zealand s north island 
minority interest in the earnings of rayonier timberlands  lp decreased million to million in due to lower partnership earnings  primarily reflecting lower northwest us timber prices 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in  excluding the tax benefits for two significant non cash charges see dispositions and discontinued operations  which were recorded at statutory rates 
these effective tax rates are below the us statutory rates  primarily resulting from the lower rates in effect for foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  reflects both research and investment tax credits and foreign exchange translation gains while the prior year includes certain tax benefits recognized in that pertained to prior years 
acquisition of minority interest in rtlp in january  rayonier exercised its right to acquire all of the  publicly traded class a units of rtlp for a cash purchase price of per unit in accordance with the terms of the rtlp partnership agreement 
rayonier s income statement in the future will reflect the elimination of a minority interest deduction and a reduction in selling and general expenses offset somewhat by added timber cost depletion and interest expense associated with the million cost of acquiring the class a units 
the acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method and was financed by the utilization of existing credit facilities 
results of operations  vs 
sales and operating income sales declined percent to billion in  reflecting lower fluff and specialty paper pulp prices as well as reduced north american log trading volume and lower new zealand log pricing 
operating income for the year was million  down from million in  due to the disposition charge of million associated with the closure of the port angeles pulp mill and lower fluff pulp pricing 
timber and wood products sales of timber and wood products declined percent to million  and operating income declined percent to million 
the declines were due to lower export log volumes and margins  and lower timber prices  partially offset by significantly improved wood products results 
in  the new zealand operations were divided into separate trading and timberlands management organizations that are now reported as distinct lines of business 
trading and merchandising sales declined percent to million due to lower north american log trading volume and operating income declined due to weakness in asian wood markets 
timberlands management sales of million  including additional timber sales of million from new zealand activity  increased percent from while operating income declined as lower timber prices in both the northwest and southeast regions  resulting from weak export and domestic log markets  offset increased harvest activity in the northwest 
wood products sales increased percent in  and operating results improved significantly due to higher lumber prices and volumes  lower raw material costs and improved conversion costs 
specialty pulp products sales of million for the company s jesup and fernandina pulp mills were million lower than and operating income of million declined million from the prior year due to significantly lower fluff and specialty paper pulp selling prices and unfavorable sales mix 
these impacts were partially offset by higher average chemical cellulose prices and improved production costs 
intersegment intersegment sales of million in were less than the million recorded in due to lower log sales from the timber and wood products segment to the specialty pulp products and dispositions segments 
dispositions full year sales from the port angeles pulp mill of million were million below the prior year due to curtailed production as a result of lower market prices 
an operating loss  prior to closure charges  of million was million worse than the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  rayonier recorded a disposition charge of million after tax  or per share  primarily related to the planned closure of the port angeles pulp mill on february  the pretax charge of million included a million loss on disposal of mill assets with a net book value of million  accruals of million for severance  relocation  demolition  environmental cleanup and other items associated with the disposition  and million for loss on disposal of other non strategic assets 
the liquidation of working capital and tax benefits associated with the closure offset cash closure costs 
dismantling began in and is expected to be substantially completed in other income expense interest expense for decreased million to million as a result of lower average debt  lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest 
rayonier purchases forward exchange contracts to offset the impact of new zealand us dollar exchange fluctuations on operating results 
the net gain on these contracts  which is included in interest and miscellaneous expense income  net  was million in compared to million for in  movement of the new zealand us dollar exchange rate had an adverse effect on the company s new zealand operating income of million 
the exchange rate increased from on january   to on december  a non operating gain related to the sale of a percent interest in approximately percent of the company s new zealand timber holdings to a timber investment fund 
the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of million  million after tax  or cents per share 
minority interest in the earnings of rtlp decreased million to million due to lower partnership earnings resulting from lower timber prices in both the southeast and northwest regions of the us  partially offset by volume increases 
income taxes excluding the tax benefits for the two significant non cash charges which were booked at statutory rates  the effective tax rate for was percent and reflected the recognition of a tax asset related to a prior year transaction following resolution of various uncertainties 
the effective tax rate of percent reflected the benefits of foreign source income and tax credits on exported pulp sales 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted statement of position environmental remediation liabilities issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
adoption of the pronouncement resulted in a cash neutral pretax charge of million million after tax  or per share 
the company s annual cash flow was not impacted by the adoption of the accounting pronouncement 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities in was million  or approximately per share  up million from the favorable change was primarily due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements 
this cash flow financed capital expenditures of million  dividends of million and the repurchase of common shares of million 
cash from operating activities in increased million over levels to million
