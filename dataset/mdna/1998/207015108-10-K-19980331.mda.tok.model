pcs is a wireless communications service based on lower power and a higher frequency bandwidth than cellular service 
pcs is anticipated to be more reliable  of better quality and less expensive for the customer  than cellular 
the basic trading areas in which cwc was the successful bidder are reading  pottsville  sunbury  and williamsport  pa 
these territories cover nine counties in pennsylvania with an estimated population of  management views participation in pcs as being an important part of its future business
