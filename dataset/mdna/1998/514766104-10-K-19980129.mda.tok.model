except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of its intelimer r technology and related products 
the company has launched three product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts  in april  intellipac r breathable membranes for the fresh cut produce packaging market  in september  and intelimer polymer systems in june to date  the company has recognized million in total sales of its quickcast products included in discontinued operations  intellipac breathable membrane products and intelimer polymer systems products 
as part of an effort to focus and build on three strategic businesses food products  industrial specialties and agriculture the company has recently completed or plans to complete several strategic transactions 
on april  the company acquired dock resins  which is primarily engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of specialty acrylics and other polymers 
on september   intellicoat acquired fielder s choice  a direct marketer of hybrid seed corn 
on august  the company sold its quickcast product line to bissell 
in december  the company licensed the rights to worldwide manufacturing  marketing and distribution of the port ophthalmic devices to a large national eyecare company 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and expects to incur additional losses  primarily due to the continuation of its research and development activities  charges related to acquisitions  and expenditures necessary to further develop its manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
from inception through october   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
results of operations the company s results of operations reflect only continuing operations of the company 
the results of the discontinued quickcast operation are discussed seperately in the respective sections 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  total revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales increased to million in fiscal year from  in fiscal year due primarily to million of product sales from dock resins 
also contributing to the increase were intellipac breathable membrane product sales which increased from  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  due primarily to an increase in unit sales 
revenues from research and development funding was  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year product sales for the discontinued quickcast product line for the period from november  through the measurement date of june  were  which was included in the loss from discontinued operations 
there were no revenues from license fees during fiscal year compared to  during fiscal year the decrease in license fees revenue was due to a one time payment in the second quarter of fiscal year under an expanded agreement with nitta corporation 
cost of product sales consists of material  labor and overhead 
cost of product sales was million for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of higher margins resulting from product sales of the dock resins products 
cost of product sales for the discontinued quickcast product line for the period from november  through the measurement date of june  was  which was included in the loss from discontinued operations 
the company anticipates that gross margins as a percentage of revenue will continue to improve due to the historically higher margins achieved from sales of dock resins and fielder s choice s products which have historically ranged between approximately to 
however  longer term improvement is unpredictable due to the early stage of commercialization of several of the company s products and integration of certain of these products into dock resins manufacturing process 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the company s research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses involved in the development  process scale up and efforts to protect intellectual property content of the company s enabling side chain crystallizable polymer technology and research and development expenses related to dock resins products 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increased development costs for the company s intelimer polymer systems and intellicoat tm seed coating products and the addition of development costs related to dock resins products during fiscal year in future periods  the company expects that spending for research and development will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although it may vary as a percentage of total revenues 
during fiscal year  the company expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  million of in process research and development acquired as part of the dock resins acquisition in april such in process technology was determined to have no alternative future uses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with the company s product sales  business development expenses  and staff and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing expenses  the additional administrative costs associated with supporting a public company for an entire year the company s initial public offering was completed on february   and the acquisitions of dock resins and fielder s choice during fiscal year specifically  sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to the costs to create marketing departments for the intelimer polymer systems and intellicoat products and the acquisition of dock resins and fielder s choice during fiscal year sales and marketing costs for the discontinued quickcast product line for the period from november  through the measurement date of june  were  which was included in the loss from discontinued operations 
although the company expects to achieve certain future cost savings as a result of the discontinuation of the quickcast product line  the company s total selling  general and administrative spending for existing and newly acquired products will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although it may vary as a percentage of total revenues 
net interest income was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due principally to the interest expense on the payable related to the acquisition of dock resins 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  total revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of 
revenues from research and development funding increased to million for fiscal year from  for fiscal year due to an increase in the effort spent on research and development contracts in fiscal year revenues from product sales increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year due to increased sales volume of intellipac breathable membrane products 
license fees decreased to  for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily due to non recurring license fee revenue recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal year under the company s agreement with hitachi chemical 
in consideration for the license fees and research and development funding received from its corporate partners  the company granted certain licenses and product rights 
see business technology licensing business 
cost of product sales consists of material  labor and overhead 
cost of product sales was  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of the costs associated with ramping up the intellipac breathable membrane product line and the minimal sales in fiscal year research and development expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of increased process development costs associated with the launch of the company s intellipac breathable membrane products and development of the port ophthalmic device 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with the company s product sales  business development and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of expenses associated with the company s withdrawal of a planned secondary public offering  business development initiatives  increased sales and marketing expenses and the additional administrative costs associated with supporting a public company 
sales and marketing expenses were  for fiscal year compared to none for fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to the costs to support the market introduction of the breathable membrane products launched in late fiscal year and the creation of marketing departments for the intelimer polymer systems and intellicoat products during the fourth quarter of fiscal year net interest income was million for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year net interest income increased due to interest income earned on the company s initial public offering proceeds 
liquidity and capital resources as of october  the company had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  a net decrease of million from million as of october  this decrease was primarily due to cash used by operations of million for fiscal year  the net payment of million and the establishment of a restricted investment of million related to the acquisition of dock resins and the net payment of million related to the acquisition of fielder s choice 
as of october   the company had payables totaling million related to the acquisition of dock resins which will be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal year  the company purchased seed processing equipment and incurred leasehold improvements expenditures to support the development of intellicoat products  purchased packaging equipment to meet the increased demand for the intellipac breathable membrane products and incurred building improvement expenditures to expand capacity at dock resins 
these expenditures represented the majority of the million of property and equipment purchased during fiscal year the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
the company s future capital requirements  however  depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  the development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of the company to maintain existing collaborative and licensing arrangements and establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  the assimilation and integration of dock resins and fielder s choice into landec and intellicoat  respectively  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if the company s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
the company has no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to the company on favorable terms if at all 
additional factors that may affect future results the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  the company s actual results and could cause the company s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit 
the company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception  including a loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal year  and the company s accumulated deficit as of october  totaled million 
the company expects to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future net losses and time required by the company to reach profitability are highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach or sustain profitability 
uncertainty relating to integration of new business acquisitions 
the successful combination of the company and dock resins and intellicoat and fielder s choice will require substantial effort from each organization 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the successful combination of the companies will also require coordination of their research and development  manufacturing  and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the company s activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel of dock resins and fielder s choice  or that the company will realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
early commercialization  dependence on new products and technologies  uncertainty of market acceptance 
while the company recently commenced marketing certain of its intelimer polymer products  it is in the early stage of product commercialization of these products and many of its potential products are in development 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and market new products in its target markets and in new markets 
in particular  the company expects that its ability to compete effectively with existing food products  industrial  agricultural and medical companies will depend substantially on successfully developing  commercializing  achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing the company s products 
in addition  commercial applications of the company s temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop  commercialize  achieve market acceptance of or reduce the cost of producing the company s products  or that the company s competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or otherwise superior to those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or that new products and technologies will gain market acceptance 
the failure to develop and successfully market new products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the success of the company in generating significant sales of its products will depend in part on the ability of the company and its partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of the company s products and technology 
the extent to which  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by the company s current and future products is a function of many variables including  but not limited to  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  conversion costs and marketing and sales efforts  as well as general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
there can be no assurance that markets for the company s products will develop or that the company s products and technology will be accepted and adopted 
the failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition and technological change 
the company operates in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food products  industrial  agricultural and medical companies is expected to be intense 
in addition  the nature of the company s collaborative arrangements may result in its corporate partners and licensees becoming competitors of the company 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the company  and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
there can be no assurance that these competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
limited manufacturing experience  dependence on third parties 
the company s success is dependent in part upon its ability to manufacture its products in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve this 
the company has experienced negative gross margins on certain of its products sold 
although the company believes dock resins will provide landec with practical knowledge in the scale up of intelimer polymer products  production in commercial scale quantities may involve technical challenges for the company 
the company anticipates that a substantial portion of the company s products will be manufactured in the linden  new jersey facility acquired in the purchase of dock resins 
the company s reliance on this facility involves a number of potential risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  and low manufacturing yields and high manufacturing costs 
the company may also need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture certain of its products 
if the company becomes dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of its products  then the company s profit margins and its ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely basis may be adversely affected 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such parties will adequately perform and any failures by third parties may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval  impair the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis  or otherwise impair the company s competitive position 
the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the manufacture of the company s products will be subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on single source suppliers 
many of the raw materials used in manufacturing certain of the company s products are currently purchased from a single source  including certain monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for the company s intellipac breathable membrane products 
in addition  virtually all of the hybrid corn varieties sold by fielder s choice are purchased from a single source 
upon manufacturing scale up and increases in hybrid corn sales  the company may enter into alternative supply arrangements 
although to date the company has not experienced difficulty acquiring materials for the manufacture of its products nor has fielder s choice experienced difficulty in acquiring hybrid corn varieties  no assurance can be given that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future  that the company will be able to obtain substitute vendors  or that the company will be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture and distribute its products and  consequently  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
customer concentration 
for the fiscal year  sales to the company s top five customers accounted for approximately of the company s product sales with the top customer accounting for of the company s product sales 
the company expects that for the foreseeable future a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its net revenues 
the company may experience changes in the composition of its customer base as dock resins and fielder s choice have experienced in the past 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of such major customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  since the products manufactured in the linden  new jersey facility are often sole sourced to its customers  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders  that orders by existing customers will not be canceled or will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will be approved  that the company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to the company will provide the company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the company s technology 
the company has received  and may in the future receive  from third parties  including some of its competitors  notices claiming that it is infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
for example  the company has received a letter alleging that its intellipac breathable membrane product infringes patents of another party 
the company has investigated this matter and believes that its intellipac breathable membrane product does not infringe the specified patents of such party 
the company has received an opinion of patent counsel that the intellipac breathable membrane product does not infringe any valid claims of such patents 
if the company were determined to be infringing any third party patent  the company could be required to pay damages  alter its products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
if the company is required to obtain any licenses  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by the company  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to the company or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any such litigation or interference proceeding  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming and could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require the company to cease using such technology and  consequently  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see business patents and proprietary rights in item government regulation 
the company s products and operations are subject to substantial regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
although landec believes that it will be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of its products and polymer materials  such regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to such matters as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances will not adversely effect the company s business 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future  or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
see business fda and other governmental regulations in item environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in certain manufacturing processes 
dock resins is involved in various investigations and proceedings conducted by the federal environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials and the remediation of its linden  new jersey facility 
although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ  the company believes certain escrowed funds will prove adequate to account for any resultant liability  including any new jersey industrial site recovery act remediation regarding its linden  new jersey facility 
in most cases  the company s liability will be limited to sharing clean up or other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that changes in environmental regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
limited sales and marketing experience 
the company has only limited experience marketing and selling its intelimer polymer products 
while dock resins will provide consultation and in some cases direct marketing support for landec s intelimer polymer products  establishing sufficient marketing and sales capability will require significant resources 
the company intends to distribute certain of its products through its corporate partners and other distributors and to sell certain other products through a direct sales force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct salespersons or distributors  or that the company s sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
to the extent that the company has or will enter into distribution or other collaborative arrangements for the sale of its products  the company will be dependent on the efforts of third parties 
there can be no assurance that such sales and marketing efforts will be successful and any failure in such efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on collaborative partners and licensees 
the company s strategy for the development  clinical and field testing  manufacture  commercialization and marketing of certain of its current and future products includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensees and others 
to date  the company has entered into collaborative arrangements with the bfgoodrich company and hitachi chemical in connection with its intelimer polymer systems  fresh express farms  apio  inc  roplast industries  inc and printpack  inc 
in connection with its intellipac breathable membrane products  and nitta and hitachi chemical in connection with its adhesive products 
the company is dependent on its corporate partners to develop  test  manufacture and or market certain of its products 
although the company believes that its partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that such partners will perform their obligations as expected or that the company will derive any additional revenue from such arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company s partners will pay any additional option or license fees to the company or that they will develop and market any products under the agreements 
moreover  certain of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner  and certain of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under certain other circumstances 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the amount of royalties  if any  on future sales of quickcast and port products as the company no longer has control over the sales of such products since the sale of the quickcast and the license of port product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company s partners will not pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to the company s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such collaborative arrangements will be successful 
to the extent that the company chooses not to or is unable to establish such arrangements  it would experience increased capital requirements to undertake research  development  manufacture  marketing or sale of its current and future products in such markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to independently develop  manufacture  market  or sell its current and future products in the absence of such collaborative agreements and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
international operations and sales 
during fiscal years and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were derived from product sales to and collaborative agreements with international customers  and the company expects that international revenues  although down from historical levels  will continue to be an important component of its total revenues 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by the regulatory approval process  government controls  export license requirements  political instability  price controls  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs or difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
foreign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the united states  and any inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on the company s international business and its financial condition and results of operations 
while the company s foreign sales are currently priced in dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  such as those recently experienced in many asian countries which comprise a part of the territories of certain of the company s collaborative partners  may reduce the demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries to which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that regulatory  geopolitical and other factors will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results 
in the past  the company s results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future 
quarterly operating results will depend upon several factors  including the timing and amount of expenses associated with expanding the company s operations  the timing of collaborative agreements with  and performance of  potential partners  the timing of regulatory approvals and new product introductions  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scale manufacturing of existing products and the mix between domestic and export sales 
the company also cannot predict rates of licensing fees and royalties received from its partners 
in addition  due to the cyclical nature of the corn seed industry  a significant portion of fielder s choice revenues and profits will be concentrated over a few months during the spring planting season generally during the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and there can be no assurance that the company will become or remain profitable in the future 
product liability exposure and availability of insurance 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of the products being developed by the company involve an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
while no product liability claims have been made against the company to date  if any such claims were made and adverse judgments obtained  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company has taken and intends to continue to take what it believes are appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to product liability claims  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant liability 
the company currently maintains medical and non medical product liability insurance in the minimum amount of million per occurrence with a minimum annual aggregate limit of million 
there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or will continue to be available at an acceptable cost  if at all 
a product liability claim  product recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
possible volatility of stock price 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations  the attainment of or failure to attain milestones in the commercialization of the company s technology  new products  new patents or changes in existing patents  the acquisition of new businesses or the sale or disposal of a part of the company s businesses  or development of new  collaborative arrangements by the company  its competitors or other parties  as well as government regulations  investor perception of the company  fluctuations in the company s operating results and general market conditions in the industry may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of technology companies and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely effect the market price of the company s common stock 
impact of year the company is in the process of performing its assessment of the impact of year on its operations 
management is in the process of formalizing its assessment procedures and developing a plan to address identified issues 
the company has evaluated its financial and accounting and inventory tracking systems and concluded that they are not materially affected by the year it is unknown the extent  if any  of the impact of the year on other systems and equipment 
a corporate wide inventory of computer applications is being performed and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year after which the company will attempt to remedy any issues 
the company has also begun communications with its facilities managers to determine the impact on building security and related equipment 
there can be no assurance that all third parties will address the year issue in a timely fashion if at all 
any year compliance problems of either the company  its suppliers  its manufacturers  its collaborative partners and licensees or its customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
