the decrease in international sales is primarily the result of decreased orders from asia and south america 
the asian crisis is causing severe global smt pwb assembly plant over capacity 
as the industry reorganizes and becomes more efficient  used assembly equipment is currently depressing demand for new smt assemblers sold by the company 
therefore  there is still uncertainty regarding the outlook for the company s markets in fiscal in  net sales increased  or over net sales in the preceding year 
the increase in net sales in was primarily attributable to commencement of sales of newly introduced products and to increased sales of recently introduced products

in  gross margin decreased to from in gross profit was negatively affected by lower margins in all major product lines as a result of competitive pricing pressures and from commencement of sales of the qsa  which contributed lower margins as a result of the qsa being manufactured by a third party
