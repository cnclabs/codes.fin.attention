the company s business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the christmas holiday  back to school season  and other periods when schools are not in session 
the christmas holiday season remains the company s single most important selling season 
the company believes  however  that the importance of the summer vacation and back to school seasons which affect operating results in the second and third quarters  respectively and  to a lesser extent  the spring break season which affects operating results in the first quarter  reduces somewhat the company s dependence on the christmas holiday selling season 
furthermore  summer vacation  spring break and the back to school season take place at somewhat different times in different parts of the country  spreading the impact of these events on the company s sales over a longer period 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel  accessories and related merchandise  the company typically experiences lower net sales and operating losses during the first fiscal quarter
