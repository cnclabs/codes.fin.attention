additionally  barra s consolidated subsidiary  barra international japan  ltd 
barra japan  generates revenues  has expenses and has assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen 
all other things being equal  weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact on profits  and strengthening of the us dollar has a negative impact 
the company has considered its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations and to this point has decided not to engage in hedging or managing exposures to foreign currency fluctuations through contracts for the purchase  sale or swapping of currencies 
accordingly  a strengthening of the us dollar versus other us currencies could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  the us dollar strengthened against the yen and ecu and weakened against the pound 
the resulting net effect of these movements in average exchange rates on operating revenues and net income was a decrease of approximately  and  respectively 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  there was a significant strengthening of the us dollar against the yen while average exchange rates for pounds and ecu s remained relatively constant 
the company estimates that the impact of the declining value of the yen versus the us dollar during fiscal accounted for a reduction of approximately  in consolidated revenues and approximately  in consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended march  because the functional currency of barra japan is the yen  the translation gains and losses associated with the consolidation of its balance sheets at points in time are reported as part of shareholders equity 
under current operating arrangements in the countries in which barra does business  there are no restrictions upon the flow of funds from barra s foreign subsidiaries to the parent company

the company generally bills and collects fees on an annual basis  but recognizes the income th per month over each year of the subscription period 
fiscal revenues shown above include subscription and related fees of  from acquisitions completed during the year 
in addition to revenue from the acquisitions  the growth in annual subscription fees continues to be generated from a combination of both obtaining new clients as well as increasing revenues from existing customers through the introduction of new products and services 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  annual subscription fees for the us and non us markets increased approximately and  respectively 
excluding revenues from current year acquisitions  subscription fees for the us and non us markets increased and  respectively 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  annual subscription fee revenue for the us and non us markets increased approximately and  respectively 
for both markets  revenue growth primarily came from equity models and related data reflecting the continued success of aegis products 
various new single country and global versions of this equity analytics system have been introduced continuously since july fixed income product sales also contributed  primarily to the non us increase  as a result of sales of the global version of the barra cosmos system tm  which was introduced in may increases in subscription revenues continue to come most significantly from net increases in the number of subscriptions and less significantly from changes in the prices of subscriptions 
revenues from other sources related to the institutional analytics business include timesharing revenues  seminar revenues and other recurring and one time fees 
the decline in the relative and absolute amounts of this component of revenue reflects lower timeshare revenues as a result of converting clients to in house computers for running barra s products as well as moving from variable to fixed fee subscription arrangements for such services on us fixed income products 
declines in analytics related one time fees also contributed to the decrease as a result of a de emphasis on such revenue opportunities 
consulting fees consist of services delivered by barra s investment analytics  sponsor services and strategic services business groups

excluding consulting revenues from acquired businesses  total consulting revenues increased approximately  or reflecting growth in both retainer and one time project fees offset in part by a decline in the amount of fees from strategic transactions of approximately  the increase in consulting revenues from fiscal compared to fiscal was driven almost equally between growth in retainer based fee clients and one time project revenues including a strategic transaction fee in fiscal that accounted for approximately of the total consulting fees

asset management 
asset management revenues increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal compared to fiscal asset management revenues consist of business from both symphony and the asset services group which provides customized multi manager programs

symphony s total revenues were  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal performance fees included in total revenues were   and  for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
performance fees are recognized only at the measurement date for determining performance of an account  which typically is at the end of the first year of the contract and on each subsequent annual anniversary date thereafter 
the increase in performance fees over the last three fiscal years is the result not only of investment performance in excess of benchmarks  but the fact that assets under management that are subject to performance fees have grown significantly 
as of the beginning of fiscal  symphony had approximately billion of assets under direct management an increase of over the beginning of fiscal of which billion are managed under agreements that provide for performance fees in addition to a base management fee an increase of over the beginning of fiscal 
symphony also managed approximately 
billion in assets under sub advisory and other non discretionary accounts as of the beginning of fiscal symphony s future revenues will depend  in some cases to a great extent  on the performance of the funds it manages and the timing of anniversary fee determination dates for performance based funds

increases in fiscal over fiscal are primarily due to increased data  computer access and outside computer service costs associated with new and existing barra services 
the company anticipates that data and computer access costs will continue to increase into the future as barra s demands for new and expanded data sources and delivery channels increase in order to meet product development  enhancement and market needs 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal excluding compensation and benefits from business acquired during fiscal  compensation and benefits increased  or from fiscal excluding compensation and benefits from businesses acquired during fiscal  these annual increases are in part attributable to growth in the number of full time employees  which increased approximately in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal increases in group insurance costs and other related employee benefits have also contributed to increases in each of the past three years

the increase in other operating expenses from fiscal over fiscal was predominantly the result of higher external development costs associated with information systems upgrades and higher data costs at symphony 
other increases in travel  computer and office equipment  outside printing and documentation and insurance related expenses were reflective of  and consistent with  the general growth of barra s business and the costs of supporting a larger client base 
the consolidation of bond express also contributed approximately  to the increase during fiscal one time acquisition charges

interest income and other 
interest income and other decreased  or in fiscal over fiscal and increased  or in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of lower dividend income and interest earnings on notes receivable

net losses from barra s joint ventures and other strategic relationships now represent primarily barra s share of losses from its global posit joint venture and  beginning in fiscal  data downlink corporation

barra believes that its cash flow from operations including prepaid subscription fees  together with existing cash balances  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for capital expenditures and other cash needs for ongoing business operations 
principal financial commitments 
as of june   the company s principal financial commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases and contracts for the use of computer and office facilities and the initial cash consideration related to the acquisition of redpoint 
the board of directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to  of the company s common stock and has authorized up to  in funds as seed investments for new asset management products developed by symphony or the asset services group 
year it is widely anticipated that potential problems could occur after december  with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips which use year dates that have been stored as just two digits 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism  including date sensitive software  which uses only two digits to represent a year  may recognize a two digit date eg  as referring to the twentieth century eg  rather than the twenty first century eg   which could in turn result in system failure or miscalculations 
to address the year issue in the company s products and internal systems  the company has assembled a team of internal and external information technology professionals to review each of its applications and programs to identify those that contain two digit year codes 
the company has also begun coordination with other entities  including vendors that provide data for the company s investment anayltics software  to assess their year compliance efforts and the company s exposure to any non compliance by such vendors 
the company is assessing the amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected applications or programs with the goal of completing all relevant software remediation and testing by the end of the calendar year the company anticipates continuing its general year compliance efforts through based upon current information  the company believes that its expenditures for outside services relating to its year compliance efforts  excluding hardware  in fiscal and through the project s completion will be approximately million 
costs incurred relating to this project are being expensed by the company during the period in which they are incurred 
the company s expectations about future costs associated with the year issue and about the target date for completion of software remediation and testing are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that could influence the amount and timing of future costs include the success and timeliness of the company in identifying products  applications and internal software that contain two digit year codes  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected applications or programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs  and the success and timeliness of the company s external counterparties and suppliers in addressing the year issue 
european monetary union emu it is also anticipated that potential problems could arise when the emu replaces certain european currencies with the euro 
that replacement is expected to occur by january  to address the euro issue  the company has assembled a team of technology and finance professionals to review its applications and programs that use european currency data 
this team has also begun coordinating with external vendors and service providers to assess their euro compliance efforts 
based upon current information  the company believes that it s expenditures for outside services relating to its euro compliance will be approximately 
million for fiscal costs associated with modifications necessary to prepare for the emu are being expensed by the company during the period in which they are incurred 
the company s expectations for future costs associated with and timely resolution of all euro issues are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections set forth above 
factors that could influence the amount and timing of such costs include the success and timeliness of the company in identifying products  applications and internal software containing european currency data  the nature and amount of programming and research required to upgrade or replace each of the affected products and programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs  and the success of the company s external vendors and service providers in addressing the euro issue 
other factors that may affect future results because of rapid technology changes in the computer and software industry  the company s future revenues will depend on its ability to develop or acquire new products and enhance its existing products on a timely basis to keep pace with innovations in technology and support a range of changing computer software  hardware platforms and customer preferences 
lack of market acceptance or significant delays in product development could result in a loss of competitiveness of the company s products  with a resulting loss of revenues 
the company has been involved in merger and acquisition transactions 
these transactions have been motivated by many factors including the desire to obtain new technologies  the desire to expand and enhance the company s product and service lines  and the desire to attract personnel 
growth through acquisition has several identifiable risks  including risks related to integration of the previously distinct businesses into a single unit  the substantial management time devoted to such activities  undisclosed liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies  and issues related to product transition 
the company s operating expenses are partially based on its expectations regarding future revenue 
the company s consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected if revenue does not materialize in a quarter as anticipated 
since expenses are usually committed in advance of revenues  and because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenue  the company s consolidated results of operations may be impacted significantly by lower revenues which could be attributable to various factors and could affect quarter to quarter comparisons 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s revenues are earned pursuant to fixed price software subscription licenses 
variances in costs associated with those licenses could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company is dependent on the efforts of its senior management  its research and development staff  and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical and services personnel 
to the extent the company is not able to retain  attract  train  and motivate highly skilled employees  directly or through acquisition  who are able to provide services that satisfy customer expectations  the company s business and consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues 
the company s operations involve a number of risks normally associated with such operations including  among other things  adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions  volatile foreign exchange rates  currency conversion risks  limitations on repatriations of earnings  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the us  difficulties in managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  and other trade barriers 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries in which the company does business could also materially adversely affect the company s business  consolidated financial condition  and consolidated results of operations 
the company s operations are dependant on its ability to protect its equipment and the information stored in its databases against damage by fire  earthquake  or other natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  and other catastrophic events 
the company believes it has taken measures to reduce the risk of interruption in its operations 
however  there can be no assurance that these measures are sufficient 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse affect on its business  consolidated financial condition  and consolidated results of operations 
due to the foregoing  as well as other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
any change in revenues or operating results below levels expected by securities analysts for the company  and the timing of the announcement of such shortfalls  could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period
