overview redwood trust  inc is a financial institution specializing in the single family residential mortgage spread lending business 
the company earns net income to the extent that the interest income it earns from its mortgage loans and securities exceeds the cost of borrowed funds  hedging  credit loss expenses and operating expenses 
the company seeks to earn net interest income from first lien single family residential mortgage loans and securities underwritten to a or prime quality standards 
the company believes its primary competitors in the a quality mortgage spread lending business are banks  savings and loans  insurance companies  the two government sponsored mortgage entities gses fannie mae and freddie mac and other mortgage real estate investment trusts reits 
the company has chosen to pursue a wholesale strategy such as is employed by the gses rather than a retail strategy such as is employed by most banks and savings and loans 
like the gses  the company does not originate loans directly but rather acquires loans from mortgage origination companies and from the secondary mortgage market 
like the gses  the company out sources the servicing of its mortgage loans and sources its borrowings on a wholesale basis in the capital markets rather than seeking retail deposits through a branch banking system 
the company believes that its wholesale strategy allows the company to operate in a highly efficient manner while remaining focused on its core spread lending business 
over the past year  the company has moved a long way towards transforming itself from a spread lending company managing mortgage securities funded with short term debt to a spread lending company managing high quality single family mortgage loans funded with long term debt 
the impact of this transition on the company s results is discussed below 
the company has elected to be considered a reit with respect to federal and state income taxes 
this election generally allows the company to avoid paying corporate income tax so long as it distributes at least of its taxable income as dividends and meets the other reit requirements 
results of operations mortgage asset acquisitions  principal repayments and net asset growth in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired million in mortgage assets  including million in mortgage loans and million in mortgage securities 
the company received mortgage principal repayments of million and sold mortgage securities for million during this period 
the net decline in total assets was million  or  in the fourth quarter of in  the company acquired billion in mortgage loans and billion in mortgage securities 
the company received mortgage principal repayments of million and sold mortgage securities for million 
total assets grew by billion  or  to billion 
in  the company acquired billion in mortgage loans and billion in mortgage securities 
the company received mortgage principal repayments of million 
total assets grew by billion  or  to billion 
through december   all mortgage loans acquired have been high quality  adjustable rate  first lien mortgages on single family residential properties 
all mortgage securities acquired have represented securitized interests in pools of adjustable rate  single family mortgage loans 
one commonly used measure of the average annual rate of prepayment of mortgage principal is the conditional prepayment rate cpr 
the cpr for the company s mortgage loans and the mortgages contained in the pools underlying its mortgage securities increased from in to in both and the cpr rate of the company s mortgage asset portfolio in the fourth quarter of was 
the cpr rate of the company s mortgage asset portfolio has ranged between and since the fourth quarter of in addition to prepayments  the company also receives scheduled mortgage principal payments payments representing the normal principal amortization of a year mortgage loan 
some mortgage securities owned by the company are subject to call provisions and some receive accelerated payments  ie  a greater than pro rata share of principal repayments generated by the underlying mortgage pool 
thus the total amount of repayment of mortgage principal received each month exceeds the level of prepayments 
the average annualized rate of mortgage principal repayment from all of these sources as a percent of the average principal balance of mortgage assets increased from in to in to in principal repayments from all sources accelerated to in the fourth quarter of the annualized rate of mortgage principal repayment of the company s mortgage assets has ranged between and from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of creation of mortgage equity interests  issuance of long term debt  remics over the past year  the company has concentrated on reducing liquidity risk and other risks on its balance sheet by replacing short term debt with long term debt 
it has done this through the creation of mortgage equity interests 
the company defines a mortgage equity interest as the ownership of the equity portion of a mortgage spread lending subsidiary trust wherein the assets of the trust are funded with long term debt or similar instruments  the debt and other liabilities of the trust are non recourse to the company  and liquidity risk is essentially eliminated 
mortgage equity interests can be created through transactions structured as collateralized mortgage bonds  collateralized bond obligations  remics  fasits and other means 
through its special purpose finance subsidiary  sequoia mortgage funding corporation sequoia  the company issued billion of non recourse  floating rate  long term debt in in the form of collateralized mortgage bonds 
the company used the proceeds to reduce short term debt 
all of the long term debt is rated aaa  amortizes at approximately the same rate as the collateral and has a lifetime interest rate cap 
on a consolidated basis  long term debt at year end was billion and represented of total debt 
at year end  the investment in the mortgage equity interests created through the sequoia program totaled million 
liquidity and market value fluctuation risk for that portion of the company s equity base has been substantially eliminated 
recognizing this risk reduction  the company requires significantly lowered risk adjusted capital guideline amounts for sequoia assets as opposed to assets held in the redwood trust parent corporation funded with short term debt 
as a result  the company s overall weighted average risk adjusted capital guideline equity to assets ratio declined from at the end of to at the end of in and  the company acquired a million portfolio of mortgage equity interests which had been created by others in the form of subordinated tranches of remic transactions 
the company was able to effectively re finance this portfolio of mortgage equity interests in december through a non recourse re remic transaction with an insurance company as the counter party 
through this transaction  the company was able to reduce its net equity capital investment in this portfolio from million to million 
this transaction significantly reduced the company s credit risk and liquidity risk from this portfolio  while at the same time enhanced the company s return on equity from these assets and freed up a substantial portion of the company s original capital investment in this portfolio for reallocation to fund future growth opportunities 
although this re remic transaction is most easily understood as a financing  it qualified as a sale for accounting purposes 
as a result  the company recognized a gain on sale from the re remic of million for gaap income and million for taxable income and the net amount of million of assets in the remic which were refinanced through the issuance of re remic securities do not appear on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
mortgage equity interests created and retained by the company through the re remic and sequoia transactions totaled million at year end 
the company generally intends to fund ownership of mortgage equity interests with equity capital rather than through the use of debt 
over of the company s equity base was allocated to mortgage equity interests at year end the company intends to seek to increase this allocation over time through the creation of additional mortgage equity interests and through the acquisition of mortgage equity interests created by others 
interest income from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of  interest income declined by 
this decrease was the result of lower coupon rates and higher prepayments 
in the fourth quarter of  average earning assets of billion generated interest income of million 
in the third quarter of  average earning assets of billion generated interest income of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s earning asset yield interest income annualized and divided by the average daily amortized cost of earning assets of was below the yield of achieved in the third quarter of the average mortgage coupon rate mortgage interest payments annualized and divided by the average daily principal value of mortgages fell from to 
the coupon yield on the company s average amortized cost of for the company s mortgages also fell  from to 
net mortgage premium and discount amortization expenses increased from million to million from the third to the fourth quarter of these expenses reduced the yield on earning assets by in the fourth quarter of and in the third quarter of this reduction in yield due to prepayments and the drop in coupon rates resulted in the yield on earning assets falling by in the fourth quarter of from the previous quarter 
from to  interest income increased by 
from to  interest income increased by 
these increases were driven primarily by a increase in average earning assets mortgage assets plus cash from to and a increase in average earning assets from to in  the company s average earning assets of billion generated interest income of million

in  average earning assets of billion generated interest income of million

the earning asset yield for was lower than the for the actual coupon yield on the mortgage assets was slightly higher in than in versus 
the company s average amortized cost for mortgage assets  however  was higher in than in versus as was the total mortgage principal repayment rate versus 
the reduction in mortgage yield due to net premium amortization expense increased from in to in the earning asset yield for was lower than the for the actual coupon yield on the mortgage assets was higher in than in versus 
the company s average amortized cost for mortgage assets  however  was higher in than in versus as was the total mortgage principal repayment rate versus 
the negative impact to mortgage yield due to net premium amortization expense was in the  whereas net discount amortization income contributed to mortgage yield in during and  the company generally acquired mortgage assets with lower risk characteristics than those assets previously acquired 
as a result  average credit quality improved  with the percentage of the balance sheet consisting of subordinated mortgage securities rated below aa falling from at the end of to at the end of to at the end of this change in asset mix was one of the factors allowing significant decreases in the equity to assets capital adequacy guideline as determined by the company s risk adjusted capital policy 
the lower risk assets acquired by the company generally had higher acquisition prices reflecting their lower risk 
as a result  the company earned a lower yield on these mortgages 
this is part of the company s current strategy of seeking to earn higher returns on equity over time by utilizing lower risk  reduced spread assets in conjunction with greater leverage 
to some degree  the slight decrease in the earning asset yield in also reflects the high pricing levels relative to the risk for mortgages that have prevailed in the mortgage market for several quarters 
interest expense from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of  interest expense increased by 
total average borrowings remained relatively stable 
in the third quarter of  average borrowings were million of which were long term borrowings 
in the fourth quarter of  average borrowings were million of which were long term borrowings 
this increase in higher cost long term borrowings  combined with a slight increase in short term interest rates  resulted in an increase in the company s cost of funds from to from the third to the fourth quarter of from to  interest expense increased by 
this increase was driven primarily by a increase in average borrowings from to average borrowings were billion in and billion in borrowings increased at a slightly faster rate during than did earning assets versus as the company utilized a greater percentage of debt rather than equity to fund its growing mortgage operations 
the average equity to assets ratio for the company was in as compared to in an additional factor driving the increase in interest expense from to was a increase in the company s cost of funds from in to in this increase reflects higher levels of short term interest rates  the average daily one month libor rate was higher in than in the increase in cost of funds also reflects the issuance of long term debt during the third and fourth quarters of and a change in the mix of assets towards mortgage loans rather than mortgage securities 
from to  interest expense increased by 
this increase was driven primarily by a increase in average borrowings from to average borrowings were billion in borrowings increased at a faster rate during than did earning assets versus as the company utilized a greater percentage of debt rather than equity to fund its growing mortgage operations 
the average equity to assets ratio for the company was in as compared to in the company s cost of funds decreased by from in to in the decrease in cost of funds primarily reflects the decrease in short term interest rates during this period  the average daily one month libor rate was lower in than in the company s cost of funds did not fall by the full decline in short term rates due to a change in the mix of assets towards mortgage loans rather than mortgage securities and because the average term to next rate adjustment of the company s liabilities exceeded one month so the cost of funds did not drop as quickly as the one month libor rate did 
interest rate agreements expense interest rate agreements are a form of interest rate insurance  or hedging  which the company utilizes to reduce the effects that large changes in interest rates could have on its balance sheet and earnings 
the company seeks to hedge  in part  the market value and earnings risks arising from the life caps  periodic caps and the fixed coupon period to the next adjustment date for its adjustable rate mortgage assets 
the company also  in part  may hedge the market value of acquired mortgage loans prior to securitization into a mortgage equity interest  hedge the anticipated issuances of liabilities  hedge premium amortization risk that may arise from falling interest rates  and hedge the risk arising from any hybrid or fixed rate mortgages which are funded short term or on a non matched basis 
the company may use interest rate agreements for other hedging purposes as well 
interest rate agreements expense increased from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of this net expense increased as a percent of average assets from to  and as a percent of average borrowings from to 
this increase was due to an increase in the number of interest rate agreements which were effective during the fourth quarter 
from to  net interest rate agreement expense grew by  from million to million 
the net interest rate agreement expenses grew during this period as total assets and borrowings grew 
in  interest rate agreement expenses represented of average assets and of average borrowings 
in  net interest rate agreement expense represented of average assets and of average borrowings 
from to  net interest rate agreement expense grew by  from million to million 
net interest rate agreement expenses grew during this period as total assets and borrowings grew 
in  net interest rate agreement expenses represented of average assets and of average borrowings 
net interest income net interest income is interest income less interest expense and net interest rate agreement expenses 
net interest income decreased from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of the company s interest rate spread narrowed due to a decline in the yield on earning assets and an increase in the cost of funds during these periods as discussed above 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
this increase was driven by balance sheet growth 
growth in net interest income was less than the growth in average equity of 
net interest income as a percentage of average equity decreased from to 
net interest income grew more slowly than the growth in net average equity primarily due to a narrowing in the spread between the company s yield on earning assets and the cost of its borrowed funds and net hedging expenses its interest rate spread 
the company s interest rate spread was in as compared to in as discussed above  the company s yield on earning assets fell by from to while the cost of funds rose by and the cost of hedging rose by 
the company has generally been seeking to maintain or improve its return on equity by offsetting the narrower spread it earns from lower risk assets through the greater use of leverage 
because the company was not able to employ all of its capital  particularly in the second half of  this strategy was not yet fully effective 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
this increase was driven by the growth in average total equity of 
net interest income as a percentage of average equity increased from to 
net interest income grew faster in than the growth in net average equity  despite a narrowing in the company s interest rate spread 
the company s interest rate spread was in as compared to in the company s yield on earning assets fell by from to while the cost of funds declined by and the cost of hedging fell by 
net interest income grew faster than the company s average total equity due to the company s increased use of leverage during the period 
the company s average equity to assets ratio decreased from in to in please see interest income and interest expense above for a discussion of the factors that resulted in a trend towards a more narrow interest rate spread over time 
credit provision expense and actual credit losses the company establishes credit provisions in order build a reserve for potential future credit losses 
total credit provisions decreased from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of this decrease was primarily the result of the re remic transaction discussed above which allowed the company to stop building up its credit reserves on its mortgage securities portfolio 
total credit provisions of million in equaled of average assets and of average equity in total credit provisions of million in equaled of average total assets and of average equity 
total credit provisions of million in equaled of average total assets and of average equity 
the company takes credit provisions for risk of credit loss from its portfolio of below bbb rated subordinated mortgage securities as a function of projections of potential future losses 
the company reviews its loss projections based on trends in serious delinquencies and loan loss severities actual losses realized as a percent of defaulted loan balances in the underlying mortgage pools 
credit provisions for these assets were million in  million in and million in as a result of the re remic transaction discussed above  the company was able to significantly reduce its basis  and thus its credit risk  on this portfolio 
this decline in credit risk resulted in a decline in the amount of credit provision required on these assets in as compared to the company takes credit provisions for its mortgage loan portfolio to provide for expected credit losses over the life of the portfolio 
the company took mortgage loan provisions of million in  million in and million in the company s current policy is to set aside annual credit provisions for mortgage loans on an on going basis equaling to of its mortgage loan portfolio 
though  the annual provisions taken were greater than of the loan portfolio as the company sought to establish a higher base level of credit reserves 
the increase in mortgage loans provisions from to was the result of average mortgage loans increasing from billion in to billion the increase in mortgage loans provisions from to was a result of average mortgage loans increasing from billion in to billion in the company realized actual credit losses of  in   in and  in total cumulative actual credit losses from the inception of the company through december  have been credit provisions reduce net income and earnings per share but only actual credit losses are deducted when calculating taxable income 
dividends from a reit are based on taxable income  so future dividends levels will be influenced by the rate of actual realized credit loss rather than the rate of credit provisioning 
thus  the company s current credit reserve will not serve to insulate the company s dividends from the effects of future actual realized credit losses 
gain or loss on sale transactions the company sold million of mortgage securities in the gain on the sale of million of mortgage securities sold in the third quarter was million 
in conjunction with the sale of these mortgage securities  the company wrote down related interest rate agreements in the amount of million  thereby reducing the net gain to million 
the net gain from this sale  combined with the million gain in the fourth quarter of from the sale of million of mortgage securities through the re remic transaction discussed above  resulted in total gains on sales transactions of million 
these gains increased diluted earnings per share by in there were no gains or losses on sales in or operating expenses total operating expenses decreased from million in the third quarter of to million in fourth quarter of operating expenses as a percentage of average assets remained at  operating expenses as a percentage of average equity improved slightly from to  the efficiency ratio operating expenses as a percentage of net interest income worsened from to due to a decrease in net interest income  and average assets per employee decreased slightly from million to million

the company has adopted a stock option plan for executive officers  employees and non employee directors 
at december  there were  stock options outstanding   of which had current pay ders attached and  of which had stock ders attached 
a portion of these ders are subject to minimum dividend and or vesting requirements 
holders of ders are generally eligible to receive all types of distributions made to common shareholders  including any non cash or return of capital distributions 
to the extent options have been granted with current pay ders attached  gaap and taxable income will recognize the expense as cash payments accrue to the holders of the underlying option 
to the extent options have been granted with stock ders  there will be a non cash charge to operating expenses for gaap for the value of the ders which accrue 
there is no expense recognized for taxable income for stock ders until the underlying option is exercised 
in addition  for taxable income purposes only  when non qualified stock options nqso are exercised  the company will recognize an expense equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the exercise price paid 
although this is a non operating  non cash expense  such expenses arising from the future exercise of options will the lower the company s taxable income  and thus its dividend  in the quarters when nqsos are exercised

taxable income after preferred dividend as a reit  the company is required to distribute as dividends over time at least of its taxable income 
taxable income can vary from gaap income due to a variety of reasons  such as differences in credit expenses actual credit losses are deducted from taxable income rather than credit provisions  premium and discount amortization  accounting for stock options as well as other differences 
from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of  taxable income after preferred dividends fell  from million to million

on a taxable income basis  return on average common equity was for as compared to for and for taxable return on average common equity was generally influenced by the same factors that reduced gaap return on average common equity 
common share dividends in accordance with reit rules  over time the company s dividends will reflect the company s level of taxable income earned 
dividends per common share have exceeded gaap earnings per common share primarily because taxable income has exceeded gaap income in each year 
effective with the fourth quarter dividend  the company s policy is to declare a common dividend each quarter equal to that quarter s taxable income per common share entitled to a dividend 
in order to assist the company with this goal  starting in  the first three quarter dividends will be declared after taxable income has been determined for the quarter

although the loans in the mortgage pools underlying these securities were  for the most part  originated to a quality standards  these interests are subordinated to other securities issued from the same pools and therefore are subject to leveraged credit risk with respect to the underlying mortgages 
at december   the re remic mortgage equity interests had a principal value of million  an amortized cost before credit reserve of million and an estimated market value of million 
if all the underlying loans were to default  the maximum loss the company could incur would be million and the maximum impact to reported earnings  after taking into account the credit reserve of million  would be million 
the company estimates that if all the loans underlying mortgage equity interests in the re remic which were over days delinquent  in foreclosure  in bankruptcy  or reo as of december  were to default and have a loss severity of    or  realized credit losses for the company would be million  million  million or million  respectively

allocation of equity to mortgage assets the company assigns a capital requirement to each mortgage asset through its risk adjusted capital policy process 
allocations are based on the perceived risk characteristics of each asset and its associated borrowings and hedges 
at december   of the company s million of capital was allocated to aaa and aa rated mortgage securities funded short term  was allocated to mortgage equity interests the equity portion of the two sequoia trusts and the re remic and was allocated to mortgage loans which will most likely be used to create mortgage equity interests in the future but which were funded short term at that time 
the remainder of the company s equity capital of the total was not being utilized 
at december   of the company s million of capital was allocated to aaa and aa rated mortgage securities funded short term  was allocated to short funded securities rated less than aa  and was allocated to short funded mortgage loans 
the total capital allocated at that time equaled of the company s actual capital base  as the company at year end had acquired additional assets in excess of its normal balance sheet capacity pursuant to its expanded capital guidelines which are in effect in certain circumstances prior to a planned equity offering 
interest rate agreements at december   the company owned billion notional face of interest rate agreements  principally caps and swaps 
these interest rate agreements had various start dates  maturity dates  and interest rate protection features  see note interest rate agreements and note fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
these agreements are designed to reduce the company s interest rate and market value fluctuation risk 
they had a historical amortized cost basis of million and an estimated bid side market value of million as of december  market values were lower than amortized cost due to a drop in interest rate volatility assumptions in the marketplace for interest rate agreements  a drop in interest rates  the effect of taking bid ask spread mark downs on new agreements and due to the mis matched timing of gaap amortization methods for premiums paid for interest rate caps and the rate of actual economic decay in their market values 
interest rate agreements hedging mortgage loans are carried on the balance sheet at historical amortized cost  as a result changes in market values of these interest rate agreements are not shown in the valuation account 
market value fluctuations for interest rate agreements hedging mortgage securities are reflected in the company s interest rate agreement market valuation account 
at december   the company owned billion notional face of interest rate agreements with a historical amortized cost basis of million and an estimated bid side market value of million 
there is a risk that the counter parties to the company s interest rate agreements will not be able to perform to the terms of these contracts 
if this were to happen  the company s total accounting credit loss exposure would be limited to its historical amortized cost basis in these assets  although the true economic opportunity cost to the company could be higher 
through december   each of the counter parties to the company s interest rate agreements had a credit rating of at least a 
borrowings  cash balances and liquidity at december   the company s borrowings consisted of billion short term collateralized borrowing arrangements such as reverse repurchase agreements  notes payable  and revolving lines of credit short term debt  and billion non recourse  floating rate  amortizing long term debt long term debt 
the long term debt was issued in the second half of in the form of collateralized mortgage bonds through the company s sequoia program 
the funds raised in the long term debt offerings were used to reduce short term debt 
long term debt at year end represented of total debt 
at december   the company s short term debt totaled billion with a weighted average debt rate of as compared to billion with a weighted average debt rate of at december  long term debt totaled billion at december  with a weighted average all in cost of 
the company had no long term debt at december  as the company reduces risks on its balance sheet  it is able to use a greater amount of leverage under its risk adjusted capital policy 
however  the company s debt to equity ratio declined from x at december  to x at december  because the company was not taking advantage of its increased ability to leverage its balance sheet 
see stockholders equity  capital efficiency and capital adequacy 
the average debt to equity ratio increased from x during to x during at december   billion of the mortgage assets served as collateral for the company s long term debt 
the remaining mortgage assets  which had a market value of billion  were available to collateralize the company s short term debt 
the company estimates it had additional borrowing capacity in excess of its current requirements of million at year end 
in addition  the company had million of unrestricted cash 
the monthly principal and interest payments received on the mortgages which serve as collateral to the long term debt are held in trust until the bond payment date and are included in the company s cash balances as restricted cash 
at december   the company had borrowings equaling of the billion market value of its mortgage assets available to collateralize such borrowings 
the company estimates it had additional borrowing capacity at that time of million  as well as million of unrestricted cash 
the company s liquidity status  borrowing capacity  and ability to roll over its short term debt as it matures depend on the market value  liquidity and credit quality of its assets  the soundness and capitalization of the company s balance sheet  the state of the collateralized lending market and other factors 
if the company s liquidity or borrowing capacity were to become seriously diminished  the company would most likely seek to sell its mortgage assets the sale of which  in such circumstances  might be difficult and most likely would be at a loss 
in order to avoid such an occurrence  the company seeks to maintain what it believes to be a prudent level of capital  ie  the company restricts its asset growth according to its risk adjusted capital policy and thereby seeks to maintain adequate unused borrowing capacity 
at december  and december   the average term to maturity of the company s short term debt was days and days and the average term to next rate adjustment was days and days  respectively  the term to next rate adjustment was shorter than the term to maturity as some of the company s debt had a cost of funds that adjusted to market levels on a monthly or daily basis during the term of the debt 
in general  the cost of short term borrowings has been able to reset more quickly to interest rate conditions than coupon rates on the company s mortgages could adjust to those same changes 
through its hedging program  the company seeks to mitigate the short term impact that a large increase in interest rates could have on its cost of funds and spread earnings at december   the stated maturity on the company s long term debt ranged from to years 
the expected life of the debt was three to six years  as the debt generally pays down as the underlying mortgages pay down 
the debt is callable by the company before its stated maturity date 
the interest rate on the long term debt resets monthly 
at december   of the long term debt had an interest rate tied to the daily average fed funds rate  had an interest rate tied to a moving average of the one year treasury rate and had an interest rate tied to one month libor 
the debt is aaa rated  adjustable rate  amortizes at approximately the same rate as the collateral and has a lifetime interest rate cap of 
stockholders equity  capital efficiency and capital adequacy from december  to december   the company s equity exclusive of the market valuation account grew from million to million 
this equity growth was the result of the company issuing million in common stock through stock offerings  the exercise of warrants and from stock issuance pursuant to the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
equity was reduced in the second half of by million through the company s stock repurchase program 
dividends  which are based on taxable income  exceeded gaap earnings by million in  reducing stockholders equity 
book value  or equity  per common share excluding the market valuation account increased by from on december  to on december  the primary driver of this book value growth was accretive stock offerings at prices in excess of book value 
for balance sheet purposes  the company carries its mortgage securities and associated interest rate agreements at their estimated bid side market value historical amortized cost less market valuation account 
the total market valuation account for the company was a negative million on december  and negative million on december  as a result of this accounting treatment  the company s reported equity base and book value per share fluctuates due to market conditions and other factors 
mortgage loans  associated interest rate agreements and all other assets and liabilities were carried on the company s balance sheet at december  at amortized cost 
the company estimated that the bid side market value or realizable value of all its assets less the cost of paying off all of its obligations was approximately million at december  and million at december  the net total mark to market value for the company s assets and liabilities was million lower than amortized cost at december  and million lower than amortized cost at december  between december  and december   the liquidation value of the company s mortgage assets increased while the liquidation value of its interest rate agreements dropped 
the company expects that the net total mark to market value of the company may fluctuate significantly over time 
through its risk adjusted capital policy  the company assigns a guideline capital adequacy amount expressed in the form of a guideline equity to assets ratio to each of its mortgage assets 
for short term funded assets  this ratio will fluctuate over time  based on changes in that asset s credit quality  liquidity characteristics  potential for market value fluctuation  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and the over collateralization requirements for that asset set by the company s collateralized short term lenders 
capital requirements for mortgage equity interests generally equal the company s net investment 
the sum of the capital adequacy amounts for all of the company s mortgage assets is the company s aggregate guideline capital adequacy amount 
since management believes that the bulk of the capital currently necessary to manage the company prudently is needed due to the liquidity and market value fluctuation risks that arise from the utilization of short term debt  the guideline capital amount has declined as the company has eliminated some of these risks through the creation of mortgage equity interests 
the company does not expect that its actual capital levels will always  exceed the guideline amount 
the company measures all of its mortgage assets funded with short term debt at estimated market value for the purpose of making risk adjusted capital calculations 
if interest rates were to rise in a significant manner  the company s capital guideline amount would rise as the potential interest rate risk of its mortgages would increase  at least on a temporary basis  due to periodic and life caps while its actual capital levels as determined for the risk adjusted capital policy would likely fall as the market values of its mortgages  net of mark to market gains on hedges  fell market value declines may be temporary as well  as future coupon adjustments may help to restore some of the lost market value 
in this circumstance  or any other circumstance in which the company s actual capital levels fell below the company s capital adequacy guideline amount  the company would cease the acquisition of new mortgage assets until capital balance was restored 
in defined circumstances prior to a planned equity offering  management is authorized by the board of directors to acquire mortgage assets in a limited amount beyond the usual constraints of the company s risk adjusted capital policy 
as expressed as an equity to assets ratio  the company s average risk adjusted capital policy guideline capital amount declined from of assets in to in the average guideline capital amount was in the fourth quarter of since  the company has adjusted its asset and funding mix in a manner that it believes presents the company with lower levels of anticipated risk 
the capital guideline has continued to drop as a result of this adjustment 
the actual average equity to asset ratio for the company declined from in to in the actual average equity to asset ratio was in the fourth quarter of since actual equity to asset ratios have been higher in all these periods than the capital guideline ratios  the company could have owned more mortgage assets during those periods and still met its capital guidelines 
balance sheet capacity utilization the percentage of the company s capital employed in the mortgage spread lending business as opposed to being un utilized is a key measure of capital efficiency for the company 
even though average balance sheet capacity utilization increased from in to in  it has been declining throughout due to the decline in capital requirements 
it was in the fourth quarter of from june  through the common stock equity offering of july   the company was at its approximate maximum asset size as determined by its risk adjusted capital policy 
accordingly  the company ceased making firm commitments to new asset acquisitions during that period 
approximately million of the proceeds from the july offering was necessary to bring the company into compliance with its normal capital guidelines 
as a result of this constraint on acquisitions during the early part of the quarter  the level of total asset acquisitions for the third quarter of may have been less than otherwise would have been the case 
beginning in september  strong demand for mortgage assets in an environment of reduced supply led to increasing prices for mortgage loans and mortgage securities 
these rising prices together with the potential for increased mortgage prepayment rates led the company to reduce the rate at which it sought to acquire new mortgage assets 
although this decision resulted in the company s balance sheet having excess capital in the latter part of  management believed that long term shareholder value would be maximized by refraining from committing significant capital to the new mortgage acquisitions until mortgage prices adjusted downwards 
although mortgage prices did fall somewhat in the fourth quarter of  as of year end the company had still not resumed its prior rate of growth 
mortgage prices continued to fall in the first quarter of in order to utilize excess capital and increase long term shareholder value  a common stock repurchase program was announced in september 
the company repurchased a total of  shares for million as of december  the company continued to repurchase stock in the first quarter of risk management the company seeks to manage the potential credit  interest rate  liquidity and other risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for shareholders to realize attractive total rates of return through long term stock ownership in the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek  to the best of its ability  to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks it does undertake 
the company seeks to limit credit risk by maintaining what it believes to be high quality mortgage loan underwriting standards 
the company is a nationwide a or prime quality lending company it acquires and owns first mortgages on single family residential properties which have been underwritten to the highest levels of underwriting standards generally in use for these types of loans 
credit losses from such mortgages tend to be cyclical 
historically  however  the magnitude of credit loss incurred from high quality single family mortgages during historical credit cycles has been contained relative to credit losses arising from other forms of commercial  consumer and residential mortgage lending 
the company seeks to manage liquidity risk and short term borrowing roll over risk which could be caused by market value fluctuations of assets pledged as collateral for short term borrowings or by changes in lending markets through maintaining what it believes to be a high quality and liquid portfolio of mortgage assets  maintaining a hedging program utilizing interest rate agreements designed to partially mitigate net changes in the market values of its assets  maintaining what it believes to be a prudent level of capitalization and therefore a prudent level of unused borrowing capacity  and replacing a portion of its short term borrowings with long term borrowings 
liquidity risks and short term borrowing roll over risks cannot be completely eliminated unless the company can replace all of its short term borrowings with long term borrowings 
at december   the company remained exposed to such risk  particularly in general market environments of rapidly rising interest rates  market dislocation or illiquidity 
the company seeks to manage some of its interest rate risk through matching the interest rate characteristics of its mortgages and its borrowings to the degree that management believes is likely to be in the best interests of the shareholders in the long term 
the company does not seek to be perfectly matched or to entirely eliminate interest rate risk 
through december   the company has paired adjustable rate mortgages with variable rate liabilities 
the company has generally maintained borrowings which adjust to market conditions several months faster than its assets 
this short term mis match was lower on the company s balance sheet at the end of than in prior periods 
for larger interest rate increases  the potential short term negative earnings impact resulting from this short term mis match should be partially mitigated by the company s interest rate agreements 
in addition  since the company s adjustable rate earning assets have exceeded its liabilities through december   the longer term impact of an increase in short term interest rates may be positive after a lag period once the coupon rate on the assets has fully adjusted to the rate increase 
conversely  while the short term earnings effect of a decline in short term interest rates may be positive  the longer run effect after a lag period may be a decline in earnings relative to what they otherwise would have been after the coupon rates on the assets have adjusted downwards 
through december   the company generally has assumed some other types of asset liability mis matches as well  including some yield curve flattening risk the risk of six and twelve month interest rates falling relative to one and three month interest rates and some ted spread risk the risk of us treasury rates falling relative to libor rates  as the percentage of the company s assets which adjust off of treasury rates exceeds the percent of the company s liabilities which adjust off of treasury rates 
certain other types of interest rate risks remain partially unhedged as well 
management believes that the assumption of these risks  to the extent undertaken by the company  is more likely than not to result in higher earnings for the company in the long term but also  from time to time  may cause earnings volatility and opportunity cost from foregone growth potential 
management believes that retained interest rate risks to the extent they are separate from liquidity and market value fluctuation risk are unlikely to cause a safety and soundness issue for the company except in relatively extreme and unexpected scenarios 
if the rate of mortgage principal repayment of the company s mortgage assets is faster than expected  the rate at which the company amortizes its net premium balances as an expense will increase and earnings will be reduced relative to what they would have been otherwise 
changes in principal repayment rates may be a source of earnings volatility for the company 
in addition  faster principal repayments may reduce the company s net asset growth rate  net asset growth is generally an important component of future earnings growth 
prospects for the company may also be reduced by higher than expected mortgage principal repayments if the potential return characteristics of assets then available for acquisition are less attractive than those of the existing assets held in portfolio 
prepayment rates for adjustable rate mortgages increased during the third and fourth quarters of and such prepayment rates may further increase in the first half of slowing rates of mortgage principal repayment could exacerbate certain liquidity  market value fluctuation  and interest rate risks in a rising interest rate environment 
while adjustable rate mortgage principal repayment rates are not highly predictable  management believes the strongest influencing factor in the past has been the absolute level of longer term interest rates 
as longer term rates drop  adjustable rate mortgage principal repayments have tended to increase  particularly if longer term rates drop relative to shorter term interest rates 
in addition  management believes adjustable rate mortgage principal repayments have been increasing on a secular trend basis due to structural and behavioral changes in the mortgage origination market 
through december   the company has not sought to hedge mortgage principal repayment risk but rather has sought to analyze  based on individual mortgage characteristics  the propensity of each acquired mortgage or mortgage pool to experience accelerated principal repayment rates and to adjust its acquisition price bid accordingly based on the level of perceived downside and upside earnings risk 
the company has been able to effectively reduce the prepayment risk on some of its assets though the issuance of long term debt with certain characteristics 
the pricing of mortgage assets relative to the underlying risk in the assets  and relative to levels at which the company can issue long term debt  has a large effect on the company s net asset growth and equity utilization  and therefore on the company s earnings growth 
higher mortgage prices on an absolute basis or on a relative basis as compared to debt markets will slow growth 
the company cannot hedge earnings volatility that may arise from this source 
virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates and other factors drive the company s performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the company s dividends are generally determined based on the company s net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  the company s activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation
