item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction with the exception of certain cautionary statements and risk factors listed below  the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the company s annual report to stockholders 
cautionary statements and risk factors the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements which could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated appear below 
readers should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
history of losses  negative cash flow prior to and in  the company experienced losses and negative operating cash flow 
the company believes it may operate at a negative cash flow for certain periods in the future due to i the need to fund certain development projects  ii cash required to enter new market areas  iii irregular bookings by customers due to the relatively high per unit cost of the company s products which may cause fluctuations in quarterly or yearly revenues  iv cash required for the repayment of debt  especially million due in july  and v possible cash needed to fully integrate src s and ventek s operations 
if the company is unable to consistently generate sustained positive cash flow from operations  the company must rely on debt or equity financing 
although the company achieved profitability in and  there can be no assurance as to the company s profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
furthermore  the non recurring expenses in early resulted in a significant loss for the year 
uncertain ability to manage growth and integrate acquired businesses as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue rapid growth 
in march and july  the company acquired pulsarr and ventek which had sales in of approximately million and million  respectively  and would have added approximately to the company s sales on a proforma basis 
pulsarr was subsequently sold in may a growth strategy involving the integration of new entities  such as ventek  will require the establishment of sales representatives and distribution relationships  expanded customer service and support  increased personnel throughout the company and the continued implementation and improvement of the company s operational  financial and management information systems 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to attract qualified personnel or to accomplish other measures necessary for its successful integration of ventek or other acquired entities or for internal growth  or that the company can successfully manage expanded operations 
as the company expands  it may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect its ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  product development the markets for the company s machine vision products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
for example  the company believes that the introduction by key technology  inc of its new line of vision sorting equipment adversely affected bookings in late and sales of products such as those offered by the company depend in part on the continuing development and deployment of emerging technology and new services and applications based on such technology 
the company s success will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to enhance its existing products and develop new products that gain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing and manufacturing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely or cost effective basis or that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products noncompetitive or obsolete 
moreover  the company may encounter technical problems in connection with its product development that could result in the delayed introduction of new products or product enhancements 
failure to develop or introduce on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
market acceptance of new products the company s future operating results will depend upon its ability to successfully introduce and market  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and enhancements to existing products 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements  if developed and manufactured  will achieve market acceptance 
the company is currently in the initial prototype stage of development on a new high speed software and digital signal processing technology designed to significantly improve system performance 
there can be no assurance that a market for this system will develop ie  that a need for the system will exist  that the system will be favored over other products on the market  etc 
or  if a market does develop  that the company will be able  financially or operationally  to market and support the system successfully 
dependence on certain markets and expansion into new markets the future success and growth of the company is dependent upon continuing sales in domestic and international food processing markets as well as successful penetration of other existing and potential markets 
a substantial portion of the company s historical sales has been in the potato and other vegetable processing markets 
reductions in capital equipment expenditures by such processors due to commodity surpluses  product price fluctuations  changing consumer preferences or other factors could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company also intends to expand the marketing of its processing systems in additional food markets such as meat and granular food products  as well as non food markets such as plastics  wood products and tobacco  and to expand its sales activities in foreign markets 
in the case of ventek  the wood products market served is narrow and cyclical  and saturation of that market and the potential inability to identify and develop new markets could adversely affect ventek s growth rate 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully penetrate additional food and non food markets or expand further in foreign markets 
lengthy sales cycle the sales cycle in the marketing and sale of the company s machine vision systems  especially in new markets or in a new application  is lengthy and can be as long as three years 
even in existing markets  due to the  to  price range for each system and possibly significant ancillary costs required for a customer to install the system  the purchase of a machine vision system can constitute a substantial capital investment for a customer which may need more than one machine for its particular proposed application requiring lengthy consideration and evaluation 
in particular  a potential customer must develop a high degree of assurance that the product will meet its needs  successfully interface with the customer s own manufacturing  production or processing system  and have minimal warranty  safety and service problems 
accordingly  the time lag from initiation of marketing efforts to final sales can be lengthy 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive 
a major competitor of the company introduced several years ago a new flat belt optical sorter product which has increased the competition that the company faces 
in the case of ventek  the wood industry continues to develop alternative products to plywood eg  oriented strand board which do not require vision systems for quality control 
some of the company s competitors  including pulsarr which was sold in may to a company significantly larger than amv  may have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
important competitive factors in the company s markets include price  performance  reliability  customer support and service 
although the company believes that it currently competes effectively with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in the future 
dependence upon certain suppliers certain key components and subassemblies used in the company s products are currently obtained from sole sources or a limited group of suppliers  and the company does not have any long term supply agreements to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these components 
although the company seeks to reduce dependence on sole or limited source suppliers  the inability to obtain sufficient sole or limited source components as required  or to develop alternative sources if and as required  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and damage customer relationships 
the purchase of certain of the components used in the company s products require an to week lead time for delivery 
an unanticipated shortage of such components could delay the company s ability to timely manufacture units  damage customer relations  and have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence upon significant customers and distribution channel the company sold equipment to an unaffiliated customer totaling of sales in and to two unaffiliated customers totaling and of sales in sales to another two unaffiliated customers totaled and of sales in ventek s sales have been to a relatively small number of multi location plywood manufacturers 
the company usually receives orders of from one to several machine vision systems  but occasionally receives larger orders 
while the company strives to create long term relationships with its customers and distributors  there can be no assurance that they will continue ordering additional systems from the company 
the company may continue to be dependent on a small number of customers and distributors  the loss of which would adversely affect the company s business 
risk of international sales due to its export sales  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the value of the u 
s 
dollar which could increase the sales prices in local currencies of the company s products in international markets  delays in obtaining export licenses  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of international laws 
for example  the possibility of sales to indonesian customers will be adversely affected by the recent currency devaluation 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the timing of significant orders and shipments  product mix  delays in shipment  capital spending patterns of customers  competition and pricing  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the timing of research and development expenditures  expansion of marketing and support operations  changes in material costs  production or quality problems  currency fluctuations  disruptions in sources of supply  regulatory changes and general economic conditions 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
moreover  due to the relatively fixed nature of many of the company s costs  including personnel and facilities costs  the company would not be able to reduce costs in any quarter to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales  and such a shortfall would have a proportionately greater impact on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
for example  a significant portion of the company s quarterly net sales depends upon sales of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
thus  changes in the number of such high priced systems shipped in any given quarter can produce substantial fluctuations in net sales  gross profits  and net income from quarter to quarter 
in addition  in the event the company s machine vision systems average selling price increases  of which there can be no assurance  the addition or cancellation of sales may exacerbate quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
the company s operating results may also be affected by certain seasonal trends 
for example  the company may experience lower sales and order levels in the first quarter when compared with the preceding fourth quarter due to the seasonality of certain harvested food items and the timing of annual or semi annual plant shut downs during which systems are installed 
the company expects these seasonal patterns to continue  though their impact on revenues will decline as the company continues to expand its presence in non agricultural and other markets which are less seasonal 
risks associated with possible acquisitions the company may pursue strategic acquisitions or joint ventures in addition to the acquisitions of pulsarr subsequently divested in may and ventek as part of its growth strategy 
while the company has no understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any further acquisition  the company anticipates that one or more potential opportunities may become available in the future 
acquisitions and joint ventures would require investment of operational and financial resources and could require integration of dissimilar operations  assimilation of new employees  diversion of management resources  increases in administrative costs and additional costs associated with debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition or joint venture by the company will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or will not result in dilution to existing shareholders 
if additional attractive opportunities become available  the company may decide to pursue them actively 
there can be no assurance that the company will complete any future acquisitions or joint ventures or that such a future transaction will not materially and adversely affect the company 
dependence upon key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing contributions of its key management  technical  sales and marketing and other key personnel 
except for william j 
young  the company s president and chief executive officer  alan r 
steel  the company s chief financial officer  dr 
james ewan  src s president and chief executive officer  and the four former stockholders of ventek  the company does not have long term employment agreements or other arrangements with such individuals which would encourage them to remain with the company 
the company s future success also depends upon its ability to attract and retain additional skilled personnel 
competition for such employees is intense 
the loss of any current key employees or the inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing personnel or attract such additional skilled employees in the future 
intellectual property the company s competitive position may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
although the company has a number of united states and foreign patents  there can be no assurance that any such patents will provide meaningful protection for its product innovations 
the company may experience additional intellectual property risks in international markets where it may lack patent protection 
product liability and other legal claims from time to time  the company may be involved in litigation arising out of the normal course of its business  including product liability and other legal claims 
while the company has a general liability insurance policy which includes product liability coverage up to an aggregate amount of million  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims in the future 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company  that any such assertion of infringement will not result in litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation 
furthermore  litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company 
any infringement claims or litigation against the company could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
if a substantial product liability or other legal claim against the company were sustained that was not covered by insurance  there could be an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and marketability of the affected products 
warranty exposure and performance specifications the company generally provides a one year limited warranty on its products 
in addition  for certain custom designed systems  the company contracts to meet certain performance specifications for a specific application 
in the past  the company has incurred higher warranty expenses related to new products than it typically incurs with established products 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial warranty expenses in the future with respect to new products  as well as established products  or with respect to its obligations to meet performance specifications  which may have an adverse effect on its results of operations and customer relationships 
possible need for additional financing the company may seek additional financing  however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
potential increases in the number of outstanding shares of the company s class a common stock due to convertible debt  warrants and stock options  a substantial loss in and debt incurred for the acquisition of ventek due in  may limit the company s ability to negotiate additional debt or equity financing 
shareholder rights plan in february  the company s board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right right on each outstanding share of its common stock 
the rights will be attached to the company s common stock and will trade separately and be exercisable only in the event that a person or group acquires or announces the intent to acquire or more of amv s common stock 
each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one hundredth of a share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of the rights expire on february  the rights plan is intended to protect the company s shareholders against abusive takeover tactics and to ensure that each shareholder is treated fairly in any transaction involving an acquisition of control of the company  such as partial or two tiered tender offers that do not treat all shareholders fairly and equally 
the rights do not affect any takeover proposal which the board believes is in the best interests of the company s shareholders 
pursuant to the rights plan  if the company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person or group has acquired or more of the company s outstanding common stock  each right will entitle its holder other than such person or group to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value of twice such price 
in addition  if a person or group acquires or more of amv s outstanding common stock  each right will entitle its holder other than such person or group to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of its common shares having a market value of twice such price 
following an acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of or more of the company s common stock and before an acquisition of or more of the common stock  amv s board of directors may exchange the rights other than rights owned by such person or group  in whole or in part  at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock or one one hundredth of a share of the new series of junior participating preferred stock per right 
before a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the company s common stock  the rights are redeemable for 
per right at the option of the board of directors 
while the company is not aware of any current intent to acquire a sufficient number of shares of the company s common stock to trigger distribution of the rights  existence of the rights could discourage offers for the company s stock that may exceed the current market price of the stock  but that the board of directors deems inadequate
