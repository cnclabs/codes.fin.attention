item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the company s securitization procedures 
the purchasers of the pass through certificates receive a credit enhanced security 
credit enhancement is generally achieved by the company s subordination of its excess spread in the form of over collateralization or by one or both of the following i subordination of subsidiary classes of bonds to senior classes  and ii an insurance policy provided by an aa aaa rated monoline insurance company 
as a result  each offering of the senior class of remic pass through certificates has received ratings of aaa from standard poor s ratings group and fitch investor services  lp and aaa from moody s investors service 
the pooling and servicing agreements that govern the distribution of cash flows from the loans included in the remic trusts require either i the establishment of a reserve account that may be funded by cash or a letter of credit deposited by the company  or ii the over collateralization of the remic trust  which is intended to result in receipts and collections on the loans exceeding the amounts required to be distributed to the holders of the senior remic pass through certificates 
if payment defaults exceed the amount in the reserve account or the amount of over collateralization  as applicable  the monoline insurance company policy will pay any further losses experienced by holders of the senior interests in the related remic trust or a subordinate class will bear the loss 
to date  there have not been any writedowns of subordinated classes of bonds or any calls on monoline insurance company policies obtained in any of the company s contimortgage contiwest securitizations 
loan servicing overview 
the company retains the right to service the home equity loans originated or purchased and included in contimortgage contiwest securitizations 
servicing includes collecting payments from borrowers  remitting payments to investors who have purchased the loans  investor reporting  accounting for principal and interest  contacting delinquent borrowers  conducting foreclosure proceedings and disposing of foreclosed properties 
as of march   contimortgage serviced  loans in states with an outstanding balance of billion  up from march  earning a servicing fee of approximately basis points per annum 
contimortgage has a sophisticated computer based mortgage servicing operation that it believes enables it to provide effective and efficient processing of home equity loans 
the key elements of any servicing operation are the quality and experience of the staff and the effectiveness of the computer software 
the servicing system is an on line real time system 
it provides payment processing and cashiering functions  automated payoff statements  on line collections  hazard insurance and tax monitoring and a full range of investor reporting requirements 
contimortgage is a fannie mae and freddie mac approved seller servicer 
as such  contimortgage is subject to a thorough due diligence of its policies  procedures  and business  and is qualified to underwrite  sell and service loans on behalf of both fannie mae and freddie mac 
this designation is typically a prerequisite for loan securitization 
the pooling and servicing agreements which govern the distribution of cash flows within the remic trusts generally require that contimortgage  as servicer  advance interest but not principal on any delinquent loans to the holders of the senior interests in the related remic trust until satisfaction of the note  liquidation of the mortgaged property or charge off of the loan to the extent contimortgage deems such advances of interest to be ultimately recoverable 
to the extent there are any realized losses on loans  such losses are paid out of  current excess spread  the related reserve account  out of principal and interest payments on over collateralized amounts or  if necessary  from the related monoline insurance company policy 
collections 
the contimortgage collection department is organized into divisions each led by a collections or a default manager 
the collection divisions are comprised of teams whose responsibilities include contacting first payment defaults that are one to ten days delinquent and post day delinquent accounts with balances over  the default divisions are comprised of teams of foreclosure and bankruptcy coordinators assigned different geographic regions and reo and property preservation units assigned the task of monitoring and preserving collateral values 
if a property is acquired through foreclosure  the company will market the property for liquidation and recovery 
during fiscal  the company s loss mitigation team further developed its loss mitigation strategy 
this strategy includes  in certain circumstances  the identification of individual defaulted loans and repossessed properties to be purchased out of its remics 
after buying these assets out of the remics  they are resolved using loss mitigation techniques which may include sales to third party investors 
this process  while successfully meeting the company s goal of reducing loss severity and improving long term remic and residual loss performance  did have the effect during fiscal of accelerating losses 
for the company s fiscal years ended march  and  accelerated losses were basis points and basis points  respectively 
see defaults and losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 
generally  collection activity will commence once a loan has not been paid within five days of the due date 
once a loan becomes days past due  a collection supervisor generally analyzes the account to determine the appropriate course of action 
on or about the th day of delinquency  each property is typically inspected 
the inspection indicates if the property is occupied or vacant  the general condition of the property  whether the condition is deteriorating  and a recommendation for securing  repair or maintenance 
borrowers usually will be contacted by telephone at least five times and also by written correspondence before the loan becomes more than days delinquent 
collection activity on accounts days or more delinquent typically emphasizes curing the delinquency  including the use of formal forbearance  refinance and voluntary liquidation and other means directed at completely curing the delinquency 
in most cases  accounts that cannot be cured by reasonable means will be moved to foreclosure as soon as all legal documentation permits 
depending upon the circumstances surrounding the delinquent account  a temporary suspension of payments or a repayment plan to return the account to an up to date status may be authorized by the collection supervisor 
in any event  it is the company s policy to work with the delinquent customer to resolve the past due balance before legal action is initiated 
mortgaged properties securing loans that are more than days delinquent  including loans in foreclosure  are typically inspected on a monthly basis 
in most cases  the cost of these inspections will be advanced by contimortgage and charged to the individual escrow accounts of the borrowers 
the company expects that the cost of inspections generally will be recovered through reinstatement  liquidation or payoff 
the property preservation unit generally reviews each inspection report and takes whatever corrective action is necessary 
the cost to secure  winterize or maintain a property are typically charged to the borrower s escrow account 
if and when a property moves to foreclosure status  a foreclosure coordinator will review all previous inspection reports  evaluate the lien and equity position and obtain any additional information as necessary 
the ultimate decision to foreclose  after all necessary information is obtained  is made by an officer of contimortgage 
foreclosure regulations and practices and the rights of the owner in default vary from state to state  but generally procedures may be initiated if i the loan is days or more delinquent  ii a notice of default on a senior lien is received  or iii contimortgage discovers circumstances indicating potential loss exposure

financing and asset securitization services general the company provides financing and asset securitization execution and expertise to originators of a broad range of consumer and commercial loans  leases  receivables and other assets 
through contitrade and contifinancial services  the company provides financing and asset securitization services to its subsidiaries and strategic alliance clients 
contitrade provides financing and structuring of asset backed securities 
contifinancial services  a national association of securities dealers  inc nasd member and broker dealer  privately places or underwrites offerings of asset backed securities on behalf of the company and its finance company clients 
targeting opportunities the company seeks to identify consumer and commercial loans  leases  receivables or other assets which have the potential to be more efficiently financed through securitization and to form strategic alliances with the originators of such assets 
identifying such assets involves a thorough analysis and due diligence of i the asset loan  lease  or receivable  ii the management team of the potential strategic alliance client  and iii the servicing systems of the potential strategic alliance client 
the credit review process of the company seeks to determine whether or not a new asset is securitizable to investment grade and whether there exists a ready and interested investor base for the new product 
the due diligence process and the results thereof are outlined in a risk memorandum 
the preparation of the risk memorandum is an intensive process  managed by the company s chief credit officer  and focuses on four areas i background on company  management  asset and industry  ii risks and mitigating factors  iii projected profitability  and iv balance sheet and cash impact 
once the risk memorandum is completed  the decision to securitize a new class of assets with a new client is subject to approval by a credit committee made up of senior executive officers of the company 
after the credit process is completed for a new client  each subsequent securitization transaction by that client will be subject to an abridged credit review process 
client services the company provides warehouse financing  whole loan purchasing  hedging  credit enhancement and excess spread receivables financing services to the company s subsidiaries  equity investments and strategic alliance clients 
warehouse financing 
the company makes financing available to its securitization clients through secured loans or purchase commitments to facilitate the accumulation of securitizable assets prior to securitization warehouse financing 
as of march   through contitrade  the company had committed billion of financing to its third party clients and equity investments  of which million was drawn down 
warehouse financing commitments are typically for a term of one year or less and are generally designed to fund only securitizable assets 
assets from a particular client typically remain in the warehouse for a period of up to days at which point they are securitized and sold to institutional investors  in most cases  through contifinancial services  the company s nasd registered broker dealer 
the company utilizes its asset purchase and sale facilities with certain financial institutions purchase and sale facilities and a funding agreement under an agreement to repurchase repurchase agreement to finance this warehouse financing 
whole loan purchasing 
the company seeks opportunities to purchase assets for sale into securitized trusts and to recognize gain on sale 
the company s strategic alliance clients often seek to raise additional cash to cover the expenses and the negative cash flow associated with securitization 
therefore  whole loan pools of assets may be purchased by the company from a strategic alliance client and then securitized under the company s name or the name of its strategic alliance client 
the company will typically invest its capital in the transaction through the purchase of loans at a premium and the assumption of certain costs of securitization 
conduits 
the company also executes its loan purchase strategy through loan conduits 
conduits are stand alone securitization vehicles where the originator s  underwriter s  servicer s  and seller s may all be different parties coming together to generate loans to be serviced and securitized 
conduits allow smaller originators to sell their product into a single securitizable pool  thus benefiting from the economies of scale and the ability to share the fixed transaction costs associated with securitization 
the company has established a conduit for commercial multi family mortgages contimap registered trademark 
the company s role is to provide capital through warehouse financing and or the purchase of loans at a premium and to ensure that the loans are underwritten to the conduit s underwriting guidelines and are thus securitizable 
in addition  the company also manages the ultimate sale or securitization of the loans originated through contimap registered trademark 
the company had previously also operated an adjustable rate mortgage conduit which was closed in fiscal due to the strategic acquisition of royal  previously the major participant of the conduit 
hedging 
as certain assets are accumulated for securitization  they are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
this is because the securitization of each asset class is priced to the investor utilizing the united states treasury security with a maturity most closely matching the assets average lives 
therefore  at the client s discretion  the company will hedge the specific united states treasury security in the cash market 
credit enhancement 
to the extent that the securitization of a particular asset class requires credit enhancement in addition to the excess spread  the company will consider providing that additional support in the form of i an initial deposit to be reimbursed from the cash flow of the assets securitized or ii the purchase of a mezzanine security 
excess spread receivables financing 
in certain cases  the company finances a client s excess spread receivables in order to provide the client with cash to cover the expenses and negative cash flow associated with securitization 
the financing is typically in the form of a secured loan 
the company commits to provide such financing only to its strategic alliance clients 
in each case  in return for the financing  the company will receive ownership participations either in the strategic alliance clients or in the portfolio of loans securitized 
as of march   the total committed amount of such financing was million and the amount outstanding of such financing was million 
contifinancial services placement of asset backed securities 
securitization or structured finance expertise is the foundation upon which the company has built its business and executes its strategy 
since through march   the company has structured or placed billion of securitized assets representing transactions for contimortgage  triad and other clients 
contifinancial services placement capabilities accomplish two objectives i generating fee income  and ii providing a controlled exit strategy for assets financed by allowing the company and its strategic alliance clients to manage more effectively when and how transactions are brought to market 
while contifinancial services placement capabilities have been primarily focused on private placements  to the extent opportunities exist in the public market  contifinancial services will bid out the public underwriting business to other investment banks and manage the process on behalf of itself and its clients 
the company has filed a billion shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the commission with billion available at march  to securitize certain asset backed securities 
if the company is successful in a strategic alliance earning fees for warehousing  gain on sale for whole loan purchases and sales  and fees for the placement of asset backed securities while its client experiences significant growth and profitability  the strategic alliance client will ultimately need the services of a larger full service investment bank 
the company s strategy  however  contemplates this evolution through i continuing to purchase whole loans from the strategic alliance client  ii creating new loan conduits  iii recognizing the value of any strategic alliance equity interests  and  most importantly  iv continuing to develop new securitizable assets and strategic alliances 
purchase and sale facilities and repurchase agreement facilities as of march   the company had billion of committed and an additional billion of uncommitted sale capacity under its facilities 
the facilities allow the company to sell  with limited recourse  interest in designated pools of loans and other assets 
the company utilized the facilities to sell assets totaling billion  billion and billion  in the fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of march   the company had utilized billion of the sale capacity under the facilities 
asset classes since  the company has expanded the scope of its products to include equipment leases  franchisee loans  commercial multi family loans  non prime and sub prime auto loans and leases  and timeshare loans 
the following table illustrates the company s securitizations and sales volume the company s securitizations and sales volume by asset classes years ended march  total by asset class in millions home equity  home improvement and other residential mortgage loans contimortgage contiwest securitizations      other home equity  home improvement and other residential mortgage sales  total home equity  home improvement and other residential mortgage sales      commercial real estate mortgage loans   non prime and sub prime auto loans and leases arms equipment leasing title i home improvement loans franchisee loans other total securitization volume       includes strategic alliances sales 
home equity  home improvement and other residential mortgage loans 
the company leveraged its financing capabilities and structured finance expertise by acquiring contimortgage in and establishing strategic alliances with other clients in the home equity loan industry 
in addition to providing its financing  hedging and securitization services to contimortgage  the company also provided its services to other clients 
commercial real estate mortgage loans 
in  the company established a commercial real estate conduit  contimap registered trademark  to satisfy a need in the marketplace for the financing of  to million loans secured by commercial properties  such as multi family dwellings  self storage facilities  assisted living and other health related facilities  retail and industrial buildings 
since fiscal  the company s commercial real estate loan securitizations  made through contimap registered trademark  the company s commercial real estate conduit  has increased at an annual compound growth rate of to billion 
contimap registered trademark purchases commercial real estate loans suitable for securitization and sale into the capital markets 
the company underwrites the loans and manages the aggregation of the loans through correspondent relationships with established lending companies 
the company s strategy is to grow contimap registered trademark by continuing to add additional qualified commercial lenders and by continuing to enhance its product offerings 
as part of this strategy  in april  as previously discussed  the company acquired a interest in keystone mortgage partners llc an originator and servicer of commercial mortgage loans 
in march  the company also expanded its commercial mortgage business by investing in convertible preferred stock and warrants of crown northcorp  inc crown 
the preferred stock  when converted  and the warrants  when exercised will represent of the common stock of crown 
crown is an international financial services firm which originates commercial mortgages and provides asset management and loan servicing capabilities 
non prime and sub prime auto loans and leases 
non prime and sub prime automobile lending represents loans to credit impaired borrowers 
like the home equity loan market  the company believes that prudent loan underwriting and pricing  coupled with strong servicing and collections  mitigates the risk of the non prime and sub prime credit borrower 
non prime auto loans and leases are originated to primarily b and c credit grade borrowers as opposed to sub prime auto loans which are usually issued on a discount basis to c and d credit grade borrowers 
in fiscal  the company purchased of the common stock of triad  a california based auto finance company specializing in origination of non prime auto finance contracts for used and new vehicles and in fiscal  the company purchased the remaining of the common stock of triad 
as of march   triad has relationships with over  dealerships in states  with california representing approximately of loan originations 
as with contimortgage  triad utilizes centralized origination  underwriting and servicing techniques 
the company believes that significant opportunities still exist in the non prime and sub prime auto loan and lease market due to i the higher cost of funds through which these assets are typically being financed  ii the discipline which the regular securitization process brings to the origination  underwriting  servicing  collection and monitoring of auto loans and leases  iii consolidation in the industry  and iv the company s ability to identify strong management teams and provide its unique mix of products and services 
adjustable rate mortgages 
the company established an adjustable rate mortgage conduit arm conduit in the company s arm conduit allowed smaller originators to sell their loan product into a single securitizable pool and to benefit from the economies of scale not otherwise available to them on a stand alone basis 
in fiscal  the company acquired royal  the largest contributor to the arm conduit and discontinued the conduit 
equipment leasing 
the equipment leasing industry is a highly fragmented industry where leases of a wide array of equipment are made to predominately commercial users 
the typical leasing company provides a specialized service to a relatively specific asset class eg  office equipment or medical equipment 
the company has financed various assets for several equipment lease company clients ranging from fax machines to million mri machines 
in january  the company formed contileasing to provide equipment financing solutions to small businesses nationwide  targeting relationships with equipment manufacturers and dealers to develop customized financing programs 
title i conventional home improvement loans 
home improvement loans represent loans to homeowners  a portion of which may be guaranteed by the us government in the case of title i home improvement loans for the purpose of certain pre qualified home improvements 
the company decided to pursue this business line  which was a natural extension of its home equity loan business  because of its highly fragmented nature and higher cost of funds through which these assets are typically being financed 
the company executed securitizations  in the form of conduits where it financed and placed title i and conventional home improvement loans on behalf of conduit participants and through a strategic alliance with one of the conduit participants 
the company s strategy is to facilitate the growth of its strategic alliance client through securitizations  expanding its presence nationwide  building economies of scale and helping to create a low cost  high volume producer in an otherwise fragmented industry 
the company s  wholly owned subsidiary ulg and empire  in which the company owns a minority interest  also originate title i and conventional home improvement loans through retail origination channels 
franchisee loans 
franchisee loans represent loans to franchisees of top tier national restaurant chains and other franchise chains 
in the company s securitization of franchisee loans  the underwriting process focuses on the franchisee borrower s ability to generate cash flow from the particular restaurant as opposed to more traditional financing  which is based upon hard collateral values or the credit rating of the franchisor 
in  the company identified this niche opportunity and developed this business line in conjunction with a strategic alliance client 
the company believes that its warehouse financing  hedging  structured finance and placement capabilities combined with its unique approach to underwriting and credit analysis  will provide it with a competitive advantage 
warrants and stock ownership in certain of its strategic alliances  the company may receive strategic alliance equity interests 
based on its prior experience  the company does not anticipate that any strategic alliance equity interest that it holds or may acquire in the future will have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations until the business of the strategic alliance client matures  which typically takes several years 
however  in fiscal  the company received million of warrant income from the sale of stock warrants in a strategic alliance company 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  make a direct cash equity or subordinated debt investment in a strategic alliance client

the company offers strategic alliances complete balance sheet liability management  including warehouse financing  interest rate hedging services and structuring and placement of asset portfolios in the form of asset backed securities 
the company  through investments and strategic acquisitions  as well as through internal growth  has continued to expand and diversify its businesses 
within its core home equity business  the company has developed a significant retail origination platform to complement its established wholesale origination capabilities 
acquisitions of retail home equity loan originators are discussed below 
the retail origination subsidiaries provide a source of cash revenues through loan origination points and fees and whole loan sales 
significant growth in origination volume has been accompanied by infrastructure investments that have enhanced and expanded contimortgage corporation s contimortgage home equity loan servicing capacity  which represents another source of cash income to the company 
with a managed portfolio of billion at march   contimortgage is among the largest originators and servicers of non conforming home equity loans 
in addition to expanding its retail origination capabilities  the company has expanded home equity loan originations through its broker network  which represents a lower cost source of origination volume 
originations from direct retail operations and brokers were billion in fiscal  or of total home equity  home improvement and other residential mortgage loan origination volume 
this compares with billion  or of total originations in fiscal the company s commercial real estate activities have grown considerably over the past three years 
notable developments with respect to this business include the april acquisition of a interest in keystone mortgage partners llc and the june acquisition of a minority interest in first security commercial mortgage  lp as a consequence of its relatively low level of operating expenses  commercial real estate s contribution to the company s pre tax earnings exceeded in fiscal in fiscal  the company acquired of three home equity companies  california lending group  inc  d b a united lending group ulg  resource one consumer discount company  inc resource one  royal mortgage partners  lp  d b a royal mortgagebanc royal and of an auto finance company  triad financial corporation triad

ulg  resource one  royal  triad  fidelity and crystal are collectively referred to herein as the acquisitions 
in each case  the companies acquired were former strategic alliances or contimortgage loan origination sources 
in fiscal  the company acquired a interest in empire funding holding corp 
empire a long term strategic alliance that is one of the largest high loan to value and fha title i lenders in the united states 
the company also established new business units during focusing on small ticket equipment lease financing services and the securitization of charged off credit card and other consumer debt 
upon closing  the company s majority shareholder  continental grain company continental grain  exchanged a warrant for a equity interest in empire 
results of operations the company s development of its retail origination platform has resulted in a change in the profile of the consolidated statements of income 
retail origination expenses focus heavily on compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses  whereas wholesale origination costs in the form of origination points  are netted against gain on sale of receivables 
consequently  the accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect increases in operating expenses  as well as higher income from origination points 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  and year ended march  net income increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which in turn increased million or from net income of million in fiscal the company s total gross income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which in turn increased from million in fiscal on a percentage basis  the following table sets forth the composition of the company s results as a percentage of total gross income for the periods indicated years ended march  gross income gain on sale of receivables interest net servicing income other income total gross income expenses compensation and benefits interest provision for loan losses general and administrative total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes minority interest net income see gain on sale of receivables and excess spread receivables  for a discussion of year to year changes in the amount and composition of gain on sale of receivables 
interest income and expense in the normal course of its activities  the company carries inventories of loans pending sale or securitization and earns a positive spread between the interest income earned on those loans and its cost of financing those loans 
the company s sales and securitization volume has increased significantly  contributing to a concurrent increase in the average level of loans held in inventory pending securitization 
as a result  net interest income has increased significantly  reaching million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income also includes accrued interest on excess spread receivables esr 
in addition to the cost of financing loans pending sale or securitization  interest expense includes the cost of financing the company s longer term capital requirements  including the cost of strategic acquisitions 
interest income increased million or in fiscal over fiscal and increased million or in fiscal over fiscal interest expense increased million or in fiscal over fiscal and increased million or in fiscal over fiscal during fiscal  the company benefited from the expansion and diversification of its funding sources see liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and capital 
net servicing income net servicing income increased million or in fiscal over fiscal and million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the increase in the size of the servicing portfolio and the volume of securitizations 
the company s home equity loan servicing portfolio increased to billion at march  from billion at march  and billion at march  servicing income consists of fee income and capitalized servicing 
the fee income component which is realized in cash represents income earned from real estate mortgage investment conduits remics and trusts based on the level of loans serviced 
the fee income component of servicing income was million in  million in and million in capitalized servicing consists of servicing assets recorded in connection with new securitizations ie  the present value of future servicing income  net of expenses  reduced by amortization of capitalized servicing from prior securitizations 
the capitalized servicing component of servicing income was million in  million in and million in other income other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income consists primarily of purchase premium refunds  mortgage banking and other fees and for fiscal  income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million 
purchase premium refunds are received from certain wholesale origination sources when loans prepay within a specified time period 
purchase premium refunds were million in  million in and million in mortgage banking and other fee income was million in  million in and million in in addition  income of million was received in fiscal from the sale of stock warrants in a strategic alliance company

as noted earlier  the company has significantly expanded its retail origination platform  which in turn has resulted in a significant increase in expenses 
from the date of the acquisition of majority ownership  expenses of the acquired subsidiaries are included in the company s consolidated expenses 
as previously discussed and as demonstrated in the table above  the acquisition of retail origination subsidiaries has resulted in significantly higher levels of compensation and benefits expense and general and administrative expenses 
with respect to the company s activities exclusive of the acquisitions  the expense increases are indicative of the significant growth in contimortgage s origination volume  its serviced loan portfolio and the related growth in headcount to support these activities 
combined compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses for contimortgage exclusive of its acquisitions increased by million in and million in contimortgage s headcount exclusive of its acquisitions was  at the end of fiscal compared with at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal combined compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses for activities other than contimortgage and the acquisitions increased by million in and million in minority interest in fiscal  minority interest was attributable to the minority shareholders of contimortgage prior to the company s june  acquisition of that interest 
in fiscal and  minority interest was primarily attributable to the minority shareholders of triad prior to the company s march acquisition of that interest 
defaults and losses see contimortgage servicing portfolio on page contimortgage s servicing portfolio has grown considerably 
annual growth in the portfolio was in fiscal  in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal compound annual growth over this four year period was 
as the annual growth rate has slowed and the portfolio has seasoned  defaults as a percentage of loans outstanding have increased 
included in the default total at march  were loans performing under bankruptcy plans and reos  which represented and  respectively  of the servicing portfolio 
early in the life of a securitization  realized losses are generally very low 
losses as a percentage of average serviced loans have increased over time as the portfolio has seasoned and annual growth has decelerated 
losses in the portfolio are overwhelmingly attributable to the time period a loan remains in foreclosure status and are primarily a function of interest foregone on the loans and the deterioration of collateral value over this time frame 
during the course of fiscal  the company implemented an aggressive loss mitigation program focused on this issue  with the long term objective of a significant reduction in the time period defaulted loans are held in the serviced portfolio 
this program  which includes purchasing loans and properties out of remics for early disposition  results in a near term acceleration of losses and a longer term mitigation of total potential losses 
these accelerated losses were basis points in fiscal and basis points in fiscal the company anticipates that the continuation of this program in fiscal will result in a combination of remic losses and loss mitigation program losses on the order of to basis points as a percentage of loans serviced on a trailing month basis 
however  due in part to this acceleration of losses in fiscal and  the company expects a significant reduction in total losses as a percentage of serviced loans in fiscal and beyond 
as of march   the company projects an average annual loss rate over remaining remic lives of basis points 
see accounting for esr valuation process and significant assumptions for information regarding the company s estimated future credit losses 
gain on sale of receivables and excess spread receivables general a major source of income for the company is the recognition of gains in connection with securitizations and whole loan sales 
in a whole loan sale  the company recognizes a gain and receives cash upon completion of the transaction 
although whole loan sales represent a growing source of cash income for the company  the largest component of the company s gain on sale revenues is the securitization of home equity loans originated and serviced by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  contimortgage contiwest 
in a typical securitization  the company sells loans or other assets to a special purpose entity  established for the limited purpose of buying the assets from the company and transferring such assets to a trust  most often a remic 
the remic issues interest bearing securities that are collateralized by the underlying pool of mortgage loans or other assets  as the case may be 
the proceeds are used as consideration to purchase the assets from the company 
typically  the securities are sold at an amount that is the same or nearly the same as the underlying mortgage loan amounts and the company retains a residual interest that represents its right to receive  over the life of the securitization  the excess of the weighted average coupon on the loans securitized over the sum of the interest rate on the securities sold  a normal servicing fee  a trustee fee  an insurance fee where applicable and the credit losses relating to the loans or other assets securitized the excess spread 
in a securitization  the company may also sell a portion of this excess spread in the form of interest only io securities  which are not exposed to the risk of credit losses 
the esr is recorded as a receivable at the time of securitization 
it is subsequently realized over the life of the securitization as cash distributions are received from the trust 
esr  reported as interest only and residual certificates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  is the present value of the excess spread that the company expects to receive over the life of a securitization  taking into consideration estimated prepayment speeds and credit losses 
as a credit enhancement to support the sale of senior collateralized securities  the company s esr is subordinate to the rights of such holders 
terms of the remics or trusts generally require the establishment of a level of over collateralization  based largely on projected cumulative default and loss levels of the underlying pools of mortgages 
the required level of over collateralization is attained by utilizing cash flows otherwise distributable to esr holders to either pay down outstanding principal of senior interests or to be placed in segregated deposit accounts 
at march   over collateralization of contimortgage contiwest remics totaled million 
gain on sale of receivables the following table sets forth the components of gain on sale of receivables for each of the last three fiscal years year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  in thousands percent of percent of percent of amount total amount total amount total home equity home improvement contimortgage contiwest securitizations    other including whole loan sales  origination points and fees    total home equity home improvement    commercial real estate    auto    other    total    gain on sale of receivables increased to million in from million in and million in gain on sale of receivables includes the gain recorded upon the completion of securitizations and whole loan sales 
in a securitization  the gain is significantly affected by the estimated fair value attributed to the retained esr see accounting for esr valuation process and significant assumptions 
gain on sale of receivables also includes unrealized gains or losses that result from the quarterly adjustment of esr to fair value  points and fees generated through direct retail mortgage originations included in earnings when the loans are securitized or sold and fees earned in connection with securitization services provided to strategic alliance clients 
see securitizations hedging interest rate risk for a discussion of the impact of hedging activities on gain on sale of receivables 
securitizations of home equity loans originated by contimortgage contiwest represent the largest component of gain on sale of receivables 
revenues from contimortgage contiwest securitizations were million in compared with million in and million in the gain on sale percentage ie  gain as a percentage of contimortgage contiwest securitization volume was in compared with in and in the growth in contimortgage contiwest gain on sale of receivables was driven by a increase in securitization volume to billion  offset in part by the lower gain on sale percentage 
approximately basis points of the decrease in gain on sale percentage was attributable to a higher level of premiums paid to acquire loans from wholesale sources 
a further decrease of approximately basis points was the result of a narrowing of the spread between the weighted average interest rate on mortgage loans securitized and the pass through interest rate on securities sold 
this was attributable in part to a further flattening of the us treasury yield curve 
declines in long term mortgage interest rates exceeded declines in the related pass through interest rates 
the remaining decrease of approximately basis points resulted largely from the fair value adjustment of esr retained in connection with securitizations prior to fiscal due to higher prepayment speeds than those used to determine fair value as of march  on a weighted average basis  the estimated future conditional or constant prepayment rate cpr on contimortgage contiwest remics was increased from approximately at the end of fiscal to approximately at the end of fiscal see accounting for esr valuation process and significant assumptions for further discussion of cpr 
the increase in contimortgage contiwest gain on sale over the amount was driven by a increase in securitization volume  offset in part by the lower gain on sale percentage 
the decrease in the gain on sale percentage was primarily the result of a tightening in the spread between the weighted average interest rate on mortgage loans securitized and the pass through interest rate on securities sold 
a contributing factor was the flattening of the us treasury yield curve in fiscal  a decline in long term mortgage interest rates was accompanied by an increase in the related pass through interest rates 
cash flow and gain on sale on contimortgage contiwest securitizations are reduced by premiums paid to acquire loans from wholesale sources 
these premiums increased in  in both absolute terms and as a percentage of loans acquired 
in fiscal  premiums paid totaled million  compared with million in and million in cash expended for premiums in was largely recovered through the sale of io securities in conjunction with the securitizations and net interest margin notes nims subsequent to securitizations 
proceeds of million were generated from io sales 
fiscal nims sales generated proceeds of million 
the company has taken steps to mitigate its reliance on wholesale loan sources  primarily through the development  including acquisitions  of its retail origination platform 
in  the company s direct retail origination operations represented of the company s total home equity  home improvement and other residential mortgage loan origination volume  up from in in addition to originating loans for inclusion in contimortgage contiwest securitizations  the company s retail activities generate cash gains on sale through whole loan sales and origination points and fees 
gain on home equity whole loan sales  origination points and fees increased to million in from million in and million in over the past three years  the company has expanded and diversified its revenue sources beyond the home equity product 
commercial real estate loan sales and securitizations generated gains on sale of million in fiscal  up from million in and million in the vast majority of gain on sale resulting from commercial real estate activity is realized in cash upon completion of the transactions 
as discussed in general  the company has significantly expanded this business and expects that commercial real estate gains on sale  as a percentage of total gains on sale  will continue to increase 
gain on sale of receivables in connection with automobile loan securitizations was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in in march  the company increased its ownership of triad  its non prime automobile loan origination subsidiary  from originally acquired in november to 
securitizations hedging interest rate risk the most significant variable in the determination of gain on sale in a securitization is the spread between the weighted average coupon on the securitized loans and the weighted average interest rate on the securities issued 
in the interim period between loan origination and securitization of such loans  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the majority of loans are securitized within days of origination 
however  a portion of the loans are held for sale or securitization for as long as twelve months or longer  in very limited circumstances prior to securitization 
if interest rates rise during the period that the mortgage loans are held  the spread between the weighted average interest rate on the loans to be securitized and the pass through interest rates on the securities to be sold the latter having increased as a result of market interest rate movements would narrow 
upon securitization  this would result in a reduction of the fair value of the retained esr and the related gain on sale 
the company mitigates this exposure through short sales of us treasury securities and interest rate futures contracts 
hedge gains or losses are initially deferred and subsequently included in gain on sale upon completion of the securitization 
with respect to contimortgage contiwest securitizations  gain on sale included hedge losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these hedging activities help mitigate the risk of absolute movements in interest rates but they do not mitigate the risk of a change in the spreads between pass through certificates and us treasury securities with comparable maturities 
excess spread receivables at march  and  the company s esr portfolio was comprised of the following march  percentage march  percentage of total of total in thousands home equity contimortgage contiwest   other servicers   total home equity   home improvement   commercial real estate   auto   leases   franchise   total esr portfolio   although esr does not carry a stated rate of interest  it represents the present value of an estimated stream of future cash flows 
accordingly  over the life of the asset  interest income is accrued and  as a result  esr is increased 
as cash distributions are received  esr is reduced 
the aggregate value of esr at march  was million  compared with million at march  this increase includes million in connection with fiscal gain on sale new securitizations and changes in fair value of prior securitizations and million of accrued interest income  less million of cash received 
esr was further reduced by million in connection with sale of nims securities 
accounting for esr valuation process and significant assumptions pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  the fair value of the retained esr is accounted for as a component of sale proceeds 
consequently  the company recognizes a gain upon completion of the securitization 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company classifies esr as trading securities 
as such  they are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized changes in esr fair value are included in the company s results of operations in gain on sale of receivables in the period of the change 
the company has  from time to time  completed sales of esr  as either sales with limited recourse or nims sales 
nevertheless  there is only a limited market for esr 
the company estimates the fair value of esr through the application of discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the use of various assumptions 
a significant factor affecting the level of estimated future esr cash flows is the rate at which the underlying principal of the securitized loans is reduced 
prepayments represent principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions  prepayment speeds are generally expressed as an annualized cpr 
estimated future cpr is a significant assumption in the determination of esr fair value 
additional assumptions include estimated future credit losses and the discount rate 
a discount rate of was used to arrive at the fair values presented in the march  and consolidated balance sheets 
the company continuously monitors the fair value of esr and reviews the factors expected to influence future cpr and credit losses 
if changes in assumptions regarding expected future cpr or credit losses are necessary  esr fair value is adjusted accordingly 
both the amount and timing of expected esr cash flows are dependent on the performance of the underlying loans  and actual cash flows may vary significantly from expectations 
if actual prepayments or credit losses exceed the assumptions used to determine esr fair value  the esr carrying value would be reduced through a charge to earnings 
similarly  actual prepayment or credit losses that are less than the assumptions used to determine esr fair value  would result in an increase in esr carrying value and earnings 
further  assumptions regarding future cpr and credit losses are subject to volatility that could materially affect operating results 
prepayment speeds the following table presents historical data as well as expected future cpr for contimortgage contiwest related esr amounts  which represent of the company s total esr value at march  remics by year of issue a in millions and earlier total pool balances original       at march     fair value of esr cpr actual life to date projected for the remaining pool over its estimated remaining life a this table includes contimortgage contiwest remics  based on fiscal years ended march in developing assumptions regarding expected future cpr  the company considers a variety of factors  many of which are inter related 
these include  among other things  historical performance  characteristics of borrowers  and market factors that influence competition 
for example  historical performance indicates that the rate of prepayments generally increases from a low level shortly after loan origination and peaks in approximately to months 
subsequently  as the loan portfolio seasons  the level of prepayments generally declines 
this is commonly referred to as the prepayment ramp or curve 
for the most part  the fiscal securitizations included in the table have not yet reached the expected peak of the prepayment ramp 
consequently  actual life to date cpr for those transactions is lower than that of the prior years transactions 
the shape of the prepayment curve ie  rate of cpr increase  timing of the peak  timing and extent of subsequent decline  absolute cpr levels  etc 
may vary considerably based upon the characteristics of the underlying loans 
for example  in recent years prepayment speeds for variable rate loans have exceeded prepayment rates for fixed rate loans 
specific terms  such as the existence of prepayment penalties  will further influence prepayment performance 
for various reasons  historical performance may not necessarily be indicative of future performance 
nevertheless  it is one of many factors that are considered 
characteristics of borrowers are an important consideration in determining cpr assumptions 
credit quality and loan to value relationships both have an impact on the borrower s capacity to refinance 
improvements in borrowers credit quality  coupled with an increase in the level of competition among lenders  has created opportunities for borrowers to refinance at advantageous terms  for example  with positive up front cash flows 
industry competition has intensified  in part the result of technological improvements that enhance the ability of lenders to re solicit borrowers 
the company s analysis of prepayment performance also considers the historical performance by specific origination source eg  individual correspondents  brokers and retail units 
factors that influence prepayments range from the very broad eg  national and regional housing market conditions  lenders access to low cost financing to the very specific eg  state and local laws regarding the use of prepayment penalties  and the factors identified in this discussion are not all inclusive 
credit losses like prepayment assumptions  there are a variety of factors that the company considers in determining future credit loss assumptions 
credit losses have a direct impact on esr cash flows and  consequently  esr fair value 
the review of credit exposure considers historical experience  including frequency of defaults and loss severity ie  realized loss as a percentage of liquidated loan principal 
frequency is influenced by borrower credit quality and market conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to perform 
loss severity is influenced by the relationship of loan balances to property value and  more importantly  the length of the foreclosure and liquidation process 
the following table presents historical credit loss information  as well as expected future credit losses  for contimortgage contiwest remics  including loans and properties purchased out of the remics 
annual loss rates represent losses as a percentage of average loan principal outstanding  expressed at an annualized rate 
annual loss rates weighted average life to date projected over remaining remic lives aggregate losses as a percent of original pool balances actual life to date projected over entire life ie  historical plus future losses estimated future credit losses undiscounted million further information on credit losses is included in selected financial data and results of operations defaults and losses 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the separate discussion of gain on sale of receivables and excess spread receivables 
funding requirements the company requires continued access to short and long term sources of funding 
the company s primary cash requirements include the funding of i mortgage  loan and lease originations and purchases pending their pooling and sale  ii premiums paid in connection with the acquisition of wholesale loans  iii fees and expenses incurred in connection with its securitization program  iv over collateralization or reserve account requirements in connection with loans and leases pooled and sold  v ongoing administrative and other operating expenses  vi payments related to tax obligations  vii interest and principal payments relating to the company s long term debt and short term borrowed funds  viii the costs of sales under the company s asset purchase and sale facilities with certain financial institutions purchase and sale facilities and funding under an agreement to repurchase the repurchase agreement  collectively  the facilities  and ix the cost of any new acquisitions and subsequent purchase price adjustments on prior acquisitions 
in a securitization  the company recognizes a gain on the sale of loans or assets securitized upon the closing of the securitization  but does not receive the majority of the cash representing such gain until it realizes the excess spread  which occurs over the actual lives of the loans or other assets securitized 
home equity securitizations are cash flow negative upon their initial execution  primarily as a result of premiums paid to acquire loans from wholesale sources 
for contimortgage contiwest securitizations in fiscal  these premiums totaled million and were largely recovered through the sale of io securities and nims totaling million 
the company has taken steps to improve the cash flow characteristics of its business activities 
for example  nims and io sales have accelerated the monetization of esr 
the company has increased the relative contribution of its commercial real estate business which  for the most part  generates cash gain on sale 
development of the company s retail home equity origination platform provides a source of cash income through whole loan sales and origination points and fees 
specific cash funding requirements are listed above 
in general  cash is required to fund a operations to the extent that they generate negative cash flow and b investments strategic acquisitions and infrastructure expansion 
operating cash flows consist primarily of the cash components of gross income and expenses and the cash used to fund trade receivables including loans held pending sale or securitization  advances to affiliates and servicing advances 
cash gross income the principal non cash components of gross income include gain on sale attributable to retained esr  capitalized servicing net of related amortization and equity in undistributed earnings of less than owned subsidiaries 
interest income includes non cash interest accrued on esr 
with respect to esr  however  cash realization occurs through the receipt of cash distributions from the remics or trusts and nims and io sales 
total gross income of million in fiscal included cash interest income of million  cash servicing income of million and other cash income of million 
gain on sale  excluding the contimortgage contiwest securitizations was million  of which million was realized in cash at the time of the sale or securitization 
net cash flow from contimortgage contiwest securitizations  taking into consideration proceeds from nims sales and  at the time of the securitization  io sales  was negative million 
cash distributions on esr during fiscal were million 
aggregate cash gross income in fiscal  taking into consideration all of the aforementioned items  was million 
cash expenses most of the company s expenses represent cash outflows 
total expenses in fiscal  excluding non cash deferred compensation and depreciation and amortization  were million 
trade receivables increased by approximately million in fiscal  while trade receivables sold under agreements to repurchase declined by million 
thus  cash required to fund the growth in trade receivables in fiscal was approximately million 
cash required to fund acquisitions and infrastructure investments totaled million in fiscal aggregate cash required to fund trade receivables growth  acquisitions and infrastructure investments  adjusted for net cash gross income and expenses  was approximately million 
other net cash requirements eg  taxes  shares repurchased  payments of amounts due affiliates  etc 
totaled approximately million 
the company generated cash proceeds of million from short term borrowings and million from its common stock offering 
the excess of such proceeds over aggregate cash requirements was approximately million and is reflected as an increase in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in the normal course of its activities  the company must maintain sufficient liquidity to finance loan acquisitions by its subsidiaries and strategic alliance clients 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of the timing of loan acquisitions 
the company s financing requirements and cash balances will vary considerably on a daily basis 
sources of liquidity and capital the company s primary sources of liquidity are sales of loans  leases and other assets through securitization  the sale of loans  leases and other assets under its facilities  the issuance of shares of common stock  the issuance of long term debt and short term borrowed funds 
in previous fiscal years  the company sold esr  with limited recourse  to provide cash to fund the company s securitization program 
under the recourse provisions of the agreements  the company is responsible for losses incurred by the purchaser within an agreed upon range 
at march  million of these sales were outstanding

dividend policy the company has no current intention to pay cash dividends on its common stock 
as a holding company  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from its subsidiaries

the company faces competition from other consumer finance lenders  mortgage lenders  mortgage brokers  commercial banks  mortgage banks  large securities firms  smaller boutique securities firms  credit unions  thrift institutions  credit card issuers and finance companies 
some of these competitors are substantially larger and have more capital and other resources than the company
