item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview a substantial portion of the company s revenue is derived from new foodservice equipment requirements generated by openings of new facilities by national quick service restaurant chains  convenience store chains and specialty chains or their need to replace existing equipment 
since  the foodservice equipment market has grown  primarily as a result of the domestic and international growth of the major us restaurant chains 
in the most recent available data  the domestic operating unit growth rate of u 
s 
major restaurant chains was 
in addition  the major quick service restaurant chains have commenced significant international expansion 
in  the operating unit growth rate of the four largest us restaurant chains in international markets was approximately which is nearly double its growth rate of in the company s largest customer  mcdonald s  alone accounts for more than of all international sales realized by the four largest us restaurant chains source technomics top 
also  the company s customers in the quick service restaurant industry have increased their demand for newer equipment  due in part to international expansion  menu expansion efforts  remodeling of existing stores and an increased emphasis on improved sanitation and labor and energy efficiency 
management believes that  given the company s historic relationships with the major quick service restaurant chains  bottlers and brewers  the company is well positioned to capitalize upon these growth opportunities 
also  the company has made certain operational changes which management believes have contributed to the company s improved results 
the company s financial performance is tied closely to its major customers demands for large quantities of mass produced customized products  or roll outs 
for example  from fiscal through the first six months of fiscal  the company s improved performance can be partially attributed to a continuing significant rise in the number of orders for refrigerated point of purchase displays by soft drink bottlers  primarily those associated with coca cola and pepsico products 
during the last six months of fiscal  the sales order backlog and demand for refrigerators from the soft drink bottlers returned to its historic pattern of being lower in the months of august through january as a result of lower demand from the bottler industry for point of purchase units 
however  during fiscal and  sales of refrigeration equipment to the soft drink bottler industry increased  particularly internationally 
in the past  large roll outs of products such as taylor s two sided grill have been similarly significant to the company s performance 
however  the ability to predict which customers and which products will experience roll outs is limited  and there can be no assurances that in any year the company will receive orders for any roll outs 
results of operation fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  revenue 
revenue for fiscal increased to million compared with million for the prior fiscal year 
the revenue increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of refrigeration equipment to the soft drink bottlers and sales by gamko of million which was acquired in august sales were offset  in part  by a decline in domestic sales of equipment to the company s largest customer 
the decline in the sales to this customer is primarily attributable to a successful freezer trade in program in fiscal and a reduction in the purchase of two sided cooking grills by this customer 
although the company is no longer the sole supplier of two sided cooking grills to this customer  it has continued to receive a dominant share of that business 
there is no assurance that the company will maintain such dominant share
