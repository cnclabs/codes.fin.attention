the principal factors impacting ebitda in were a higher total revenues of million offset by million in net higher property operating costs and administrative costs 
d property operating results and trends aggregate tenant sales volume over the long term  the level of anchor and mall shop tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the company as anchor and mall shop tenants provide over of total revenues and because tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of tenant sales are considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
in a period of rapidly increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of declining sales  rents on new leases tend to grow more slowly 
however  revenues generally increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average base rents per square foot for mall shop tenants at quarter end for the last three years as shown below 
the increase in average base rent during these three years results primarily from renewing existing leases at higher base rents  from leasing vacant space at higher base rents  and from elimination of lower paying tenants that closed during this period 
march june september december total reported sales for all tenants that reported sales for the applicable years are shown below in millions anchors owned locations   mall shop tenants  excluding freestanding  theater  and supermarkets the above data excludes sales from all seasonal and temporary tenants who generally do not report their sales to the company 
the growth in total anchor sales for was mitigated because of the two kmart stores that were bought out in late and which were vacant in and two temporary bon ton stores that closed in early and which were vacant during the remainder of the year 
the company owned of anchor store locations at december  comparable mall store sales and occupancy cost management believes that over long periods of time the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall shop tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs base fixed rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance and other costs pertaining to the property that they can afford to pay and still be profitable is a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
while such increased occupancy costs as a percentage of sales cannot grow indefinitely for any one tenant  management believes that it is possible to increase the percentage paid by all tenants as a group by aggressively working to replace under performing tenants with better performing ones 
comparable mall store sales per square foot in each reporting period is based on sales reported by mall store tenants excludes anchors and certain other large space users that occupied space in both the current and immediately preceding reporting period 
comparable mall store sales per square foot for the last three years are set out below 
also shown below is the percentage of mall shop tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of their annual sales 
comparable mall store sales per square foot occupancy cost percentage at period end seasonality and occupancy the enclosed shopping mall industry is seasonal in nature  with anchor and mall shop tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and expense recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  many leases are scheduled to expire in the first calendar quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
the aggregate occupancy percentage  defined as the ratio of total mall shop space that is leased including both tenants occupying space and tenants that have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy to the total mall shop space gross leasable area gla at quarter end for the last three years is set out below 
march june september december the decline in occupancy in and early occurred due to a higher than normal number of tenant bankruptcies and early closings  particularly in the first and second quarters of  and  to a lesser extent  from slower leasing activity in occupancy at december  does not include valley mall which was purchased in november as described in note to the table in item a  middletown mall and valley mall have been excluded from occupancy in all periods 
e results of operations comparison of year ended december   versus year ended december total revenues were million compared to million in contributing to the decrease in revenues were million lower business interruption insurance  lower cost recovery income due to lower recoverable costs at the properties  million lower lease buyout income due mainly to two kmart anchor lease buyouts in the third and fourth quarters of  million lower small shop base and percentage rents due to lower occupancy earlier in the year partially offset by higher average base rent per foot  million lower anchor base and percentage rents from higher anchor vacancies in  and million lower fees and commissions from sales of non company properties included in miscellaneous income

property operating and administrative costs  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased by million in compared to factors contributing to this decrease were lower snow removal costs  lower insurance costs and real estate tax expense due mainly to adjustments in assessed values  and lower consulting fees and non recoverable mall repairs

the company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors  including cash flow from operations  capital expenditures  and its ability to refinance its maturing debt as described below 
dividends by the company will be at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the trustees may consider 
during the board of trustees determined that the company should retain more of its internally generated cash flows to supplement other expected financing sources in order to make investments in certain mall expansion and renovations including the logan valley mall reconstruction and in various other investment opportunities 
accordingly  the company s quarterly dividend of 
per share was reduced to 
per share beginning with the dividend paid in september the annual amount of additional cash retained is approximately million 
sources of capital for non recurring capital expenditures  such as major building renovations and expansions  as well as for scheduled principal payments  including balloon payments on the outstanding indebtedness  are expected to be obtained from additional company or property financings and refinancings  sale of non strategic assets  additional equity raised in the public or private markets  and from retained internally generated cash flows  or from combinations thereof 
also  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in the company obtained a million working capital line of credit and a million acquisition line of credit from ge capital real estate gecre  no amounts were outstanding under either line of credit at december  on february  gecre advised the company that it had completed sufficient due diligence relating to a planned year mortgage loan to the company and was now committed to proceed with the financing pursuant to the terms and conditions outlined in a summary of terms agreement signed by gecre and the company in september the gross proceeds from the new loan the permanent loan are expected to be near million and will be used to refinance the million mortgage loans  the million gecre mortgage loan  and a million term loan 
the remaining proceeds will be used largely to fund closing costs  initial loan reserves and a prepayment penalty with respect to million of the mortgage loans that would be pre paid prior to their maturity date 
the prepayment penalty will be calculated using interest rates in effect at the time of the prepayment  based on current interest rates the prepayment penalty would be approximately million 
in addition approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the existing mortgage loans would be written off 
both of these items would be accounted for as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the permanent loan will have a fixed interest rate established at closing and will be secured by cross collateralized mortgages on up to of the malls securing the mortgage loans and the two malls securing the million gecre mortgage loan 
closing of this planned permanent loan is expected to occur on or about september  the ultimate interest rate and the amount of the permanent loan will depend of several factors  including the level of interest rates  the net operating income of the secured properties  and prescribed rating agency criteria at the time of closing 
based on current conditions  the interest rate on the new loan is expected to be lower than the average rate on the indebtedness that will be refinanced 
in connection with the permanent loan  in november the company made a million interest bearing good faith deposit with gecre that  subject to certain conditions and limitations  could be forfeited should the company decide not to consummate the permanent loan with gecre 
on december  a fire occurred at the logan valley mall located in altoona  pennsylvania 
the fire destroyed small shops aggregating  square feet of gross leasable space and also affected three additional small shops containing approximately  square feet of gross leasable space 
the net book value of the destroyed assets approximated million 
the company settled the property damage insurance claim with its insurance company in the third quarter of for million 
the difference between the amount received and the net book value of destroyed assets and the related demolition and clean up costs is million  which has been recorded as an extraordinary gain in the company also recorded million and million in business interruption insurance  during the years ended december  and  respectively  which is included in revenues 
the business interruption insurance coverage expired in may because of the business interruption insurance coverage  the fire had no material impact on  and results of operations 
during the company started the reconstruction and expansion of the fire damaged mall  the entire construction project was completed in august and cost approximately million  including tenant allowances 
the project costs were partially funded from a construction loan obtained from a bank consortium  which aggregated million by november when it was refinanced with a new loan with gecre see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  the scheduled principal payments on all debt are million  million  million  million  and million for the years ended december  through  respectively  and million thereafter 
the company expects to refinance or extend the majority of the maturities over the next five years through additional company financings and from refinancing the maturing loans  including through the planned gecre permanent loan financing more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s ability to refinance or extend these loans on or before their due dates depends on the level of income generated by the properties  prevailing interest rates  credit market trends  and other factors that may be in effect at the time of such refinancings or extensions and there is no assurance that such refinancings or extensions will be executed 
the ratios of the company s ebitda to interest paid on total indebtedness exclusive of capitalized interest and interest income for the years ended december    and were to  to  and to  respectively 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  crown investments and its subsidiary have been granted rights  subject to certain restrictions  whereby they may redeem part or all of their partnership units for shares  on a one to one basis  or cash at a price equal to the value of the company s common shares 
crown investments has pledged a portion of its limited partnership units as collateral for a loan it has received from an unrelated third party 
g economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years it has had little impact on the operations of the company during this period 
tenant leases also provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company during highly inflationary periods 
as operating costs increase  leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants and therefore  the tenants will absorb part of this increased operating cost 
most of the leases provide for percentage rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
thus  during highly inflationary periods  when retail sales at the malls increase  the company should receive additional rental income through percentage rent increases  partially offsetting the effect of inflation 
the company has made a preliminary assessment of its exposure to the so called year problem which relates to the ability of electronic equipment  computer hardware and software to properly handle dates on or after january  based on its preliminary assessment  the company believes that the cost to replace certain computer equipment and software or to reprogram certain software will not be material to its results of operations 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the financial accounting standards board has issued three new accounting pronouncements relating to disclosure matters that will become effective in  none of which is expected to have a significant effect on the company s disclosures 
h forward looking statements certain of the preceding comments in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contain forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  including overall economic and credit market conditions  the ability to refinance matrity indebtedness  the impact of competition  consumer buying trends  weather conditions  financial market conditions  and other factors
