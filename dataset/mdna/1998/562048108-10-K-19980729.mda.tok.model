item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about manatron s financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues of  for the three months ended april   have increased by compared to the  of net revenues that were reported for the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year 
annual net revenues of  for fiscal are higher than the  of net revenues that were reported for the prior fiscal year 
these amounts include revenues from computer hardware and software shipments  sales of computer forms and supplies  and various related services such as mass real estate appraisal  software support  training  hardware maintenance  and forms processing and printing 
service revenues have increased by over the prior year primarily because of the new revaluation contracts that were signed with allegheny county pittsburgh  pennsylvania  and hamilton county cincinnati  ohio  during fiscal both of these contracts which totaled approximately million will require a substantial amount of effort during fiscal and as a result  the company s backlog for appraisal services at april  is more than twice the amount it was at april  revenues from hardware  software and supply sales have increased by over the prior year primarily because of additional software license fees from new and legacy products 
hardware sales have decreased because of increased competition and reduced prices industry wide 
while software license fees have increased  the company expects its revenues in this area to be relatively flat until it has made further efforts toward the development  reengineering and deployment of the new property tax  appraisal  financial  and mirrs products 
cost of revenues for the three months ended april   increased to  compared to  for the fourth period in the prior fiscal year 
annual cost of revenues increased by from  in the prior fiscal year to  for the year ended april  these increases primarily are due to the improvement in net revenues noted above 
the prior fiscal year gross margins were approximately for the fourth quarter and for the year while the current fiscal year margins were and  respectively 
these margin fluctuations are due to changes in the mix of revenues 
selling  general  and administrative expenses have increased by to  for the three months ended april   compared to  for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year 
annual selling  general  and administrative expenses have increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal these increases primarily are due to annual salary adjustments and additional software development staff 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported operating income of  for the three months ended and  for the year ended april  this reflects significant improvement over the comparable prior year operating income of  for the three months ended and an operating loss of  for the year ended april  interest expense which is included in other expense  has decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal because the company s average borrowings under its line of credit were approximately million lower in fiscal than they were in fiscal the company s provision for federal income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
in addition  the effective tax rate generally is impacted because of non deductible goodwill amortization related to the company s acquisitions of atek and sds 
however  as described in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has not recorded a provision for federal income taxes for the three months and the year ended april   because a portion of its net operating loss carryforwards available have been utilized to offset them 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported net income of  or 
per share for the three months ended and  or 
per share for the year ended april   versus net losses of  or 
per share and  or 
per share for the comparable periods in the prior fiscal year 
weighted average shares outstanding has decreased from  to  primarily because the company repurchased  shares of its common stock in fiscal and purchases were made by employee stock plans throughout the year 
year the company is currently in the process of addressing a potential problem that is facing all users of automated information systems 
the problem is that many computer systems that process transactions based on two digits representing the year of transaction may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the problem could affect a wide variety of automated information systems  such as mainframe applications  personal computers  and communication systems  in the form of software failure  errors  or miscalculations 
by nature  the software development industry is highly dependent upon computer systems because of a date dependency for many of its applications 
the company has been developing and implementing plans to prepare itself and its customers for the year for the past few years 
this plan began with the performance of an inventory of its software applications  communications with third party vendors and suppliers and communications with customers 
the company s plan is regularly updated and monitored by technical personnel and is reviewed by management of the company on a periodic basis 
as of july   it is estimated that this plan is over complete 
the company will continue to assess the impact of  and work on  the year issue throughout fiscal the company s goal is to perform tests of its systems and applications during and and to have all targeted systems and applications compliant with the century change by june  which would allow the company to have time to address last minute issues 
the costs to implement the year changes primarily consist of personnel expense for staff dedicated to the effort and professional fees paid to third party providers of remedial services 
it is the company s policy to expense such costs as incurred 
the company also may invest in new or upgraded technology which has definable value lasting beyond in these instances  where year compliance is merely ancillary  the company may capitalize and depreciate such an asset over its estimated useful life 
based on currently available information  management does not presently anticipate that the costs to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial conditions  results of operations  or liquidity 
although not material  the costs to address the year issue have had  however  a negative effect on the company s earnings and the future costs associated with the year issue are expected to have a similar effect 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause differences include  but are not limited to  the ability of other companies on which the company s systems rely to modify or convert their systems to be year compliant  and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues of  for the three months ended april   decreased by compared to the  of net revenues that were reported for the fourth quarter in fiscal annual net revenues of  for fiscal were lower than the  of net revenues that were reported for fiscal the components of revenue and the nature of the company s business for these two years is similar to the previous description for fiscal the year to date decrease in revenues primarily was attributed to two factors delays in the completion of the company s new windows based appraisal  financial  and payroll products and the cyclical nature of the company s market for appraisal services in indiana and ohio 
the company started to release its new appraisal  financial  and payroll software to a number of customers for their review and testing in fiscal in addition  the company increased its backlog for appraisal services near the end of fiscal to approximately million which provided for the revenue growth in fiscal cost of revenues for the three months ended april   decreased to  compared to  for the fourth period in fiscal annual cost of revenues decreased by from  in fiscal to  for the year ended april  these decreases primarily were due to the reduction in net revenues noted above and an improvement in the company s gross profit margins which was attributed to a favorable change in the mix of revenues 
fiscal gross margins were approximately for the fourth quarter and for the year while the fiscal year margins improved to and  respectively 
sales of software generally yielded a much higher margin than sales of the company s other products and services 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased by to  for the three months ended april   compared to  for the comparable period in fiscal annual selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease primarily was due to the company s efforts to reduce costs without effecting the level of customer service that the company historically has provided 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported operating income of  for the three months ended and an operating loss of  for the year ended april  this was a substantial improvement over the comparable fiscal operating losses of  for the three months ended and  for the year ended april   even after the million nonrecurring charge related to the retirement of allen f 
peat  the company s former chairman  chief executive officer  and president  is excluded from the fiscal amount 
interest expense which is included in other expense  decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal because the company reduced its average outstanding indebtedness by approximately million 
the company s provision credit for federal income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income loss 
in addition  the effective tax rate generally is impacted because of non deductible goodwill amortization related to the company s acquisitions of atek and sds 
however  as described in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  the company established a valuation reserve of  against certain of its future tax benefits including its tax loss carryforward  due to the uncertainty of their ultimate realization 
as a result  only  of tax credits were reflected in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended april  and as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported net losses of  or 
per share for the three months ended and  or 
per share for the year ended april   versus net losses of  or 
per share and  or per share for the comparable periods in the prior fiscal year 
weighted average shares outstanding decreased from  to  primarily because the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock in march of from allen f 
peat in connection with his retirement

financial condition and liquidity working capital of  at april   has decreased compared to  at april  these levels reflect current ratios of and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is due primarily to the use of cash for software development and the repayment of the company s long term debt 
shareholders equity at april   increased by  to  from the balance reported at april   primarily because of the  of net income for the year 
as a result  book value per share has increased to as of april   from at april  the nature of the company s business is not property or equipment intensive 
net capital expenditures  which were approximately  for the year ended april   are higher than the comparable prior fiscal year amount of  these expenditures relate primarily to the purchase of additional or new computer hardware and software for the company s technical and support personnel 
capital expenditures for future periods are not anticipated to be significantly different from those incurred in the current period 
since the company s revenues are generated from contracts with local governmental entities  it is not uncommon for certain of its accounts receivable to remain outstanding for approximately three to four months 
as of april   the company did not have any outstanding loans due under its million revolving credit agreement and only owed  on its esop loan 
it is anticipated that the revolving credit agreement  together with existing cash balances  and cash generated from future operations will be sufficient for the company to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next months 
the company cannot determine precisely the effect of inflation on its business 
the company continues  however  to experience relatively stable costs for its inventory as the computer hardware market is very competitive 
the company anticipates that inflationary price increases related to labor and overhead will have a negative effect on cash flow and net income to the extent that the increases cannot be offset through improved productivity and price increases

such forward looking information involves important known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance  or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  uncertainties relating to economic conditions  possible future acquisitions and divestitures  technological changes and developments in the competitive environment in which the company operates  spending patterns of the company s customers  success of the company in negotiations with its lenders  size  timing  and recognition of revenue from significant orders  ability of the company to successfully implement its business strategy of developing and licensing client server decision support applications software designed to address specific industry markets  new product introductions and announcements by the company s competitors  changes in company strategy  product life cycles  cost and continued availability of third party software and technology incorporated into the company s products  cancellations of maintenance and support agreements  potential obsolescence of the company s existing products or services  pricing and availability of equipment  materials  inventories  and programming  success in and expense associated with the development  production  testing  marketing  and shipping of products  including a failure to ship new products and technologies when anticipated  failure of customers to accept these products and technologies when planned  and any defects in products  perceived absolute or relative overall value of the company s products by the company s customers  including features  quality  and pricing compared to other competitive products  amount  and rate of growth in  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses  occurrence of any expenditures and expenses  including depreciation and research and development expenses  costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal  settlements  and investigators  claims  and changes in those items  developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights  adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices  and effects or changes within the company s organization or in compensation and benefit plans 
since the purchase of the company s products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital  in the event of any downturn in any potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
further  the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue and a significant portion of the company s expenses do not vary with revenue 
as a result  if revenue is below expectations  results of operations are likely to be materially adversely affected 
shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements made in this form k  which speak only as of the date hereof
