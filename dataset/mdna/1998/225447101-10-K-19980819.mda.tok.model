see item  business  risk factors 
on september   the board of directors of cree research  inc changed the company s fiscal year from the twelve months ending june  to a or week year ending on the last sunday in the month of june 
the company s fiscal year extended for the period from july  to june  results of operations for the fiscal year ended june   cree posted record revenue and net income of  and  or per diluted share  respectively 
these results reflect an increase in revenue and net income of  and  respectively  over the prior year 
product revenue  which includes led  wafer and other material sales  module display products and moving message sign sales  reflects a increase over fiscal results 
comparatively  product revenue also increased during fiscal over amounts 
product revenue during fiscal  a significant portion of the rise in product revenue was directly attributable to the increase in blue light emitting diode led volume pursuant to an amendment to a purchase agreement signed in september with siemens ag siemens 
that agreement and two subsequent amendments  provided for million in additional sales to siemens in fiscal over as amended  the agreement presently obligates siemens to purchase certain quantities of led products through december additionally  the amendment provides for higher prices per unit on items shipped early in the contract  with unit prices being reduced as volume increases in the latter part of the contract 
further reductions in per unit costs are expected throughout fiscal as a result of the full implementation to the conductive buffer product  higher throughput and other plant asset efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that these efficiencies will be achieved 
led sales also increased by in fiscal over amounts due to volume stemming from the original agreement and first amendment with siemens 
the company continues to focus on obtaining additional led customers who are interested in ordering commercial quantities of the product 
to meet this goal the company anticipates the release of new higher brightness blue and green led products  which are expected to be competitive in outdoor applications  during the first half of fiscal anticipated volume associated with these new products  combined with lower led pricing  are expected to increase customer orders 
if the company is unable to expand its customer base or release these new products  its revenue and earnings growth potential could be adversely impacted 
the company believes that in order to significantly grow market demand for led products and to defray competition  it must continue to substantially lower prices 
during fiscal  the company s average sales price per led unit dropped over levels 
this decline in price was more than offset by the increase in product volume 
the company s goal is to continue to lower sales prices to meet customer price points throughout fiscal while the company reported a lower average sales price for leds during fiscal  total product profitability increased due to higher volumes and other efficiencies 
overall  average chip costs also declined in fiscal due to a combination of a smaller chip size  the conversion to a two inch diameter wafer  higher volume which spreads fixed costs over more units and  in the latter half of the fourth quarter  benefits from the conductive buffer technology 
during  the company anticipates further reductions in chip costs due to the full year benefits of the conductive buffer process  higher volume throughput and greater yield 
if the company is unable to realize these benefits  profits are anticipated to deteriorate during fiscal due to declining per unit sales prices in the company s contract with siemens 
greater volume  while maintaining margins per unit  has been and will continue to be cree s strategy in the led marketplace 
many current and potential customers for the company s products are based in asia 
poor economic conditions and currency devaluation in some countries may adversely affect the company s ability to increase sales volume both as a result of lower demand by customers and competition reducing the price of products 
wafer and other materials revenue has increased in fiscal over due primarily to a increase in wafer volume associated with a greater interest in the worldwide research community for sic based products 
the company continues to make improvements to the quality of its sic material  thus increasing the demand for research in microwave and power applications 
these wafer quality improvements have also led to corporate research funding  including work performed toward the development of both microwave and power devices during the year 
profits contributed by wafer sales are expected to rise as the company continues to improve quality while lowering costs due to higher throughput and greater yield efficiency 
during fiscal  wafer sales grew over amounts  due to the greater acceptance of the material in the marketplace and a slight increase in the average sales price due to a greater mix of premium wafer products available with low defect levels 
in july  the company announced development and supply agreements with c  to develop and supply bulk single crystal silicon carbide for gemstone applications 
the development program included the development of improved processes for manufacturing colorless single crystalline sic for use in gemstones with diamond like characteristics 
this research is particularly important as it also funds the development of larger diameter crystals 
in addition to the development agreement  the company also entered into an exclusive supply agreement where the output of dedicated production was supplied and priced at cost plus a stipulated margin 
for fiscal  pricing under the supply agreement has been superseded by a separate agreement that allows output from dedicated production to be priced based on the quality of the material 
in addition  c has agreed to pay the company up to million for the purchase of additional equipment to increase available capacity at cree 
over one half of this equipment was billed to c during fiscal  however this transaction was not recorded as revenue 
total revenue for materials used in gemstone applications increased in fiscal as compared to as a result of these two agreements 
material purchased by c under the supply agreement may be used solely for the fabrication and sale of gemstones 
during fiscal and  the company sold material products to c at margins consistent with those achieved in connection with sales of similar products to the company s other customers 
financial results for the display product line includes sales of both modules and sign products 
revenue for the modules business increased by in fiscal over the prior year due to increased interest among customers for the video display indoor stadium sign 
moving message sign sales by rcd  the company s subsidiary  suffered a decline in revenue compared to due to a decrease in volume and slightly reduced average sales prices 
this reduction was prompted by the company s shift to the module product line 
during fiscal  the company primarily sold an existing inventory of moving message signs and did not expand or refresh the product line 
the company is currently reviewing the business plan of these product lines to maximize sales for fiscal the company expects the release of low priced  high brightness led products that will compete in outdoor applications in fiscal these new leds are anticipated to change market opportunities for display products 
revenue for the display business grew in fiscal from due to the introduction of the modules line of business during that year 
contract revenue research contract revenue increased to  during fiscal as a result of the mix of funding from available contracts 
funding for fiscal included a higher amount of proceeds recognized under two cost share arrangements 
for these agreements  funds are recorded as a reduction in research and development expense rather than as contract revenue 
as funds associated with these two programs were exhausted during the second quarter of fiscal  company resources were shifted to programs under a cost plus or catalog price arrangement  in which funding is recorded as contract revenue 
therefore  contract revenue was higher in fiscal than contract revenue grew to  in fiscal as higher revenues were generated as a result of more funding being made available from the us government for certain research contracts  primarily in the areas of microwave  power  blue laser and basic material development 
license fee income included in revenue for fiscal is a one time license fee of  this license fee was earned pursuant to a license and technology transfer agreement entered into in september with shin etsu handotai co 
ltd 
shin etsu 
pursuant to this agreement  the company granted shin etsu a license to use certain epitaxial and device fabrication process technology for the manufacture of the company s led product 
the company also recorded an accrued expense of  payable in july to a third party that brokered the agreement 
results for fiscal include a one time net license fee revenue of  this license fee was earned pursuant to a development license and supply agreement entered in october with siemens  in which the company granted siemens a license to use certain technology to manufacture blue and green led products 
no license fee arrangements were recorded by the company during fiscal cost of revenue the company s gross margin increased to  or of revenue for fiscal the company s gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in and  respectively 
license fee revenue  which has no corresponding cost  is included in both and results 
without license fees  gross margins would have been  or of revenue for fiscal and  or of revenue for the comparative period in the overall increase in margin in stems from higher revenue and lower led and materials costs per unit 
the lower unit costs were recognized due to higher throughput  which more effectively utilized plant capacity  and yield efficiencies on led and wafer products 
this greater throughput enabled the company to spread fixed cost investments over a larger volume of product 
greater yield in led applications resulted from a combination of a new smaller die size  the new two inch diameter wafer and the introduction of the conductive buffer technology 
yield was also higher for led and materials due to plant processing efficiency and improvements and a higher quality of wafer materials 
higher margins in the future are largely contingent on the company s ability to increase the volume of leds produced  by gaining a larger customer base  successfully introducing new products and continued savings from the conductive buffer technology 
these factors are significant due to the anticipated decline in the average led per unit sales price to be received in if the company is unable to improve efficiency under the new chip standards or gain orders for additional volume  gross margin could be negatively impacted 
gross margin improved in from levels  due to higher revenue and throughput associated with the siemens agreement  and yield efficiencies  which lowered the manufacturing cost per unit 
the company benefits from research and development efforts sponsored by us government contracts 
contracts are awarded to the company to fund both short term and long term research projects 
for contracts under which the company anticipates that funding will exceed direct costs  all funding is reported as contract revenue and direct costs are reported as cost of contract revenue 
for contracts under which the company anticipates that direct costs will exceed funding  costs are reflected as research and development expenses with the related funding amounts offsetting these costs 
cost of contract revenue has increased in fiscal over due primarily to the exhaustion of funds available under two cost share contracts during the first half of the year 
costs for research under these two arrangements were included as research and development expenses rather than a cost of contract revenue 
when funding under these two contracts was completed in the second quarter of fiscal  all resources were shifted to cost plus and catalog priced contracts  where expenses are recorded as a cost of contract revenue 
contract cost of revenue was significantly higher in fiscal than as a result of more funding being made available from the us government for certain research contracts  primarily in the areas of microwave  power  blue laser and basic material development 
research and development costs have decreased by to  in due to a reduction in work performed under two cost share contracts to further the blue laser research 
net costs to the company for these projects were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
these cost share contracts concluded during the first half of additionally  research and development costs for  included a one time write off of  for the closure of the company s eastern european division 
the eastern european division  located in st 
petersburg  russia  was a research group performing some of the company s basic material and device development work 
work performed under cost share arrangements in fiscal also explains why research and development costs were higher in that year than in sales and general and administrative expenses decreased to  for fiscal  compared to levels as increased costs to support the growth of the business were offset by two one time insurance payments to the company 
as a result of the dismissal in november of a securities class action lawsuit filed in october  the company was reimbursed  by its insurance carrier for costs incurred in defense of the suit 
in addition  as a result of a negotiated cost cap  the company received a  reimbursement of medical expenses that were incurred under a partially self insured health plan 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs have decreased to in from and in and  respectively 
total sales and general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal over amounts due to higher costs associated with additional sales personnel to focus the business on gaining new led customers  the seh license agreement commission fee a net present value of  and greater legal fees in connection with the defense of a securities class action lawsuit that has since been dismissed 
the company anticipates that sales and general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in future periods to support the anticipated growth of the business  however  the cost as a percentage of total revenue is expected to decline as economies of scale continue to be realized 
other income expense includes a net loss recorded on the disposal of certain fixed assets and the write off of  for the remaining value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the real color displays subsidiary 
in addition  the company has entered into an agreement with c to sell equipment manufactured by the company at cost plus a reasonable overhead allocation 
the overhead allocation was recorded as other operating income  however  the amount was more than offset by leasehold write offs associated with the move to the new facility and other asset disposals 
net interest income increased by  in over results and decreased by  when comparing to  due to higher investable cash balances available in fiscal and cash balances were high in fiscal as the company generated over million from operations compared to million in fiscal also  the company concluded a private equity placement in september that also increased available cash in the company s income tax provision has increased to for from a effective rate experienced during the lower rate for resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company anticipates a slightly higher tax rate for fiscal as most carryforwards previously available have now been utilized 
the company had no tax provision in as the company generated a net operating loss for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations reached a record  in compared with  in  and cash used in operations of  in these increases reported in and resulted from profitable operations of the company 
if the company achieves its goals of increasing customer demand while lowering production costs  the company expects that cash provided by operations will increase in and will be sufficient to fund all anticipated capital additions 
the company will  however  consider opportunities to raise capital and to fund development costs through strategic alliances and other manners 
the number of trade average days sales outstanding was reduced to for from and days experienced in and  respectively  due to collections efforts during the year 
the company invested  in capital equipment during compared to  and  spent during and  respectively 
the majority of the spending  or  was due to the acquisition and upfit of a new production facility near research triangle park  north carolina 
the total capital outlay for this facility and associated upfit is estimated to be approximately  and is expected to be completed over the next six months 
the company currently has a loan commitment of up to  from a commercial bank to finance a portion of these expenditures 
as of june   approximately  had been drawn against this loan 
at this time  the company anticipates capital additions in to be lower than amounts spent in and intends to fund these additions with cash provided by operations and cash on hand 
in addition  the company also expects to draw the remaining  on the loan commitment and may consider other financing alternatives 
during  investments were made for equipment additions in the crystal growth and epitaxial departments 
during  a significant investment was made for equipment related to the production of led and wafer products 
financing activities provided the company  during mostly due to the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt discussed above 
in addition  financing activities yielded  during fiscal the majority of the funding was provided by the september private placement which netted approximately million 
year the company s products are of a nature that they are not subject to failure because of year issues 
the company however  has assigned full time information technology professionals to the task of identifying and resolving year problems that may affect the company s business  and has adopted a phased year compliance plan 
during the first phase  commenced in april and targeted for completion in december  the company will inventory and collect documentation on all of its computers  computer related equipment  and equipment with embedded processors 
in addition  the company will contact critical vendors and suppliers to obtain assurances of their ability to ensure smooth delivery of products and services after december in the second and third phases  the company will prioritize and implement necessary repairs or replacements to equipment in order to achieve year compliance  which it expects to complete in the first quarter of the final phase will consist of a testing program  scheduled for completion in the second quarter of the company has not prepared estimates of costs for correction of year problems 
based on information available at this time  including the year compliance status of equipment that has been examined as well as the anticipated replacement schedule for equipment  the company does not believe that the cost of remedial actions will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of corrections as the year compliance plan is performed 
failure to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
in addition  unexpected costs of correcting equipment that has not yet been fully evaluated could have an adverse effect on future results of operations
