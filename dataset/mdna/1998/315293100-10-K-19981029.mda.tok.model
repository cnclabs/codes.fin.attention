item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations for ferrellgas partners  lp and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
forward looking statements statements included in this report that are not historical facts  including statements concerning the partnership s belief that the olp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations to enable it to distribute to the mlp sufficient funds to permit the mlp to meet its obligations with respect to the mlp senior secured notes issued in april  and to enable it to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution per unit on all common units and subordinated units  are forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
the risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following and their effect on the partnership s operations a the effect of weather conditions on demand for propane  b price and availability of propane supplies  c the availability of capacity to transport propane to market areas  d competition from other energy sources and within the propane industry  e operating risks incidental to transporting  storing  and distributing propane  f changes in interest rates g governmental legislation and regulations  h energy efficiency and technology trends i year compliance and j other factors that are discussed in the partnership s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
year compliance many computer systems and applications in use throughout the world today may not be able to appropriately interpret dates beginning in the year year issue 
as a result  this problem could have adverse consequences on the operations of companies and the integrity of information processing 
the partnership began the process in of identifying and correcting its computer systems and applications that were exposed to the year issue 
the partnership initially focused on the systems and applications that were considered critical to its operations and services for supplying propane to its customers and to its ability to account for those business services accurately 
these critical areas include the retail propane accounting and operations system  financial accounting and reporting system  local area network and electronic mail systems 
the partnership expects that these critical areas will be year compliant by december  the partnership has also taken steps to identify other non critical applications that may have exposure to the year issue 
it has established a test lab for the independent testing of these applications to ensure year compatibility 
to date  no material year issues have been identified as a result of this testing 
the partnership conducts business with several hundred outside suppliers 
while no single supplier is considered material to the partnership  a combined number could constitute a material amount to the partnership 
the partnership is currently reviewing their largest suppliers to obtain appropriate assurances that they are  or will be  year compliant 
if compliance by the partnership s suppliers is not achieved in a timely manner  it is unknown what effect  if any  the year issue could have on the partnership s operations 
the partnership has evaluated its year issues and does not expect that the total cost of related modifications and conversions will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
such costs are being expensed as incurred 
to date  the partnership has currently incurred approximately  to identify and correct its year issues 
this expense has been primarily related to its critical systems and applications 
it is estimated that the partnership will incur an additional  to  during the next fiscal year to identify and correct its year issues 
the partnership does not anticipate significant purchases of computer software or hardware as a result of its year issue and does not believe that the correction of its year issues will delay or eliminate other scheduled computer upgrades and replacements 
general the partnership is engaged in the sale  distribution  marketing and trading of propane and other natural gas liquids 
the partnership s revenue is derived primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the partnership believes that it is the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states and the district of columbia through approximately retail outlets and satellite locations 
annual retail propane sales volumes were million  million  and million gallons for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  space heating  irrigation and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel  which is burned in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes 
the partnership is also engaged in the trading of propane and other natural gas liquids  chemical feedstocks marketing and wholesale propane marketing 
through its natural gas liquids trading operations and wholesale marketing  the partnership is one of the leading independent traders of propane and natural gas liquids in the united states 
the partnership s traders are engaged in trading propane and other natural gas liquids for the partnership s account and for supplying the partnership s retail and wholesale propane operations 
the partnership primarily trades products purchased from its over suppliers  however  it also conducts transactions on the new york mercantile exchange 
trading activity is conducted primarily to generate a profit independent of the retail and wholesale operations  but is also conducted to insure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
propane represents over of the partnership s total trading volume  with the remainder consisting principally of various other natural gas liquids 
for the partnership s fiscal years ended july   and  net revenues from trading activities were million  million and million  respectively 
selected quarterly financial data in thousands  except per unit data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and fourth quarter revenues  gross profit and net earnings are consistently less than the comparable second and third quarter results 
other factors affecting the results of operations include competitive conditions  demand for product  variations in the weather and fluctuations in propane prices 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended july  fiscal year ended july  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per limited partner unit fiscal year ended july  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per limited partner unit results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues decreased to  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in sales price per gallon as a result of the unusually higher wholesale cost of propane experienced in the previous year  the effects of the warmer weather  and a decrease in revenues from other operations net trading operations  wholesale propane marketing and chemical feedstocks marketing  partially offset by acquisitions of propane businesses 
a less volatile propane market during fiscal caused a significant decrease in the cost of product  which in turn caused a decrease in sales price per gallon as compared to fiscal retail volumes decreased by or  gallons  primarily due to the decrease in volumes related to the unusually warm winter during fiscal  attributable in large part to the el nino weather phenomenon 
the winter of fiscal was reported as the second warmest winter in recorded history 
for the year  temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than the same period last year as reported by the american gas association 
the warmer than normal temperatures were also compounded by other el nino related weather factors such as reduced wind chill  humidity  snow and cloud cover  all of which contributed to a lower demand for propane and a decrease in earnings for the partnership 
the decrease in revenues from other operations to  is due to a decrease in wholesale sales price per gallon and a decrease in chemical feedstocks marketing revenues 
wholesale marketing sales price per gallon decreased primarily due to the decrease in the cost of product compared to last year 
chemical feedstocks volumes decreased as a result of decreased marketing demand from petrochemical companies 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to  as compared to  during fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in retail sales gross margin dollars  partially offset by an increase from trading profits 
retail operations results decreased primarily due to decreased volumes attributed to the warmer weather  partially offset by the impact of increased retail margins and the increase in volumes attributed to acquisitions 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased slightly to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this year s operating expenses were impacted by decreased variable expenses  resulting from reduced gallon deliveries due to the warmer weather  offset by increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
vehicle and tank lease expense 
vehicle and tank lease expense increased by  due to the utilization of operating lease financing to fund fleet upgrades and replacements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased over the prior year due primarily to increased borrowings for the financing of acquisitions  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average interest rate paid by the partnership on its variable rate borrowings 
fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues increased to  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to increased sales price per retail gallon  increased retail propane volumes  and to a lesser extent an increase in revenues from other operations net trading operations  wholesale propane marketing and chemical feedstocks marketing 
a volatile propane market during the first half of fiscal caused a significant increase in the cost of product which in turn caused an increase in sales price per gallon 
retail volumes increased by or million gallons  primarily due to the increase in volumes related to acquisitions partially offset by the effect of warmer weather during fiscal as compared to fiscal and by customer conservation efforts 
fiscal winter temperatures  as reported by the american gas association  were warmer than the prior year and warmer than normal 
the increase in revenues from other operations to  was due to an increase in wholesale marketing volumes and sales price per gallon  partially offset by a decrease in chemical feedstocks marketing revenues 
wholesale marketing volumes increased primarily due to the effect of acquisitions  while prices increased as a result of increased cost of product 
chemical feedstocks volumes decreased as a result of decreased availability of product from refineries and decreased demand from petrochemical companies 
unrealized gains and losses on options  forwards  and futures contracts were not significant at july  and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to  as compared to  in the fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in retail sales gross margin  partially offset by a decrease in gross profits from other operations 
retail operations results increased primarily due to the increase in volumes attributed to acquisitions and an increase in retail margins  partially offset by the effect of warmer weather and customer conservation efforts 
wholesale marketing and chemical feedstocks was comprised of low margin sales  therefore  the net increase in revenues did not significantly affect gross profit 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to  as compared to  in the prior year primarily due to acquisition related increases in personnel costs  plant and office expenses  and vehicle and other expenses  partially offset by favorable general liability claims experience 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  as compared to  for the prior year due primarily to acquisitions of propane businesses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased over the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of the mlp s issuance of  of senior secured notes in april  the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions made in fiscal  partially offset by an overall decrease in interest rates on borrowings during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the mlp to satisfy its obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
for the fiscal year ending july   the general partner believes that the olp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations and enable it to distribute to the mlp sufficient funds to permit the mlp to meet its obligations with respect to the  senior secured notes issued in april mlp senior secured notes 
the mlp senior secured notes  the  olp senior notes new senior notes and the amended and restated olp credit facility new credit facility agreements contain several financial tests which restrict the partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur indebtedness and engage in certain other business transactions see financing activities below 
these tests  in general  are based on the ratio of the mlp s and olp s consolidated cash flow to fixed charges  primarily interest expense 
because the partnership is more highly leveraged at the mlp than at the olp  the tests related to the mlp senior secured notes are more sensitive to fluctuations in consolidated cash flows and fixed charges 
the most sensitive of the mlp related tests restricts the partnership s ability to make certain restricted payments which includes  but is not limited to  the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution mqd to unitholders 
although the mlp s financial performance during fiscal was adversely impacted by the el nino weather pattern and associated unseasonably warmer temperatures  the partnership believes it will continue to meet the mlp senior secured notes restricted payment test during fiscal  in addition to meeting the other financial tests in the mlp senior secured notes  new senior notes and new credit facility 
however  if the partnership were to encounter any unexpected downturns in business operations  it could result in the partnership not meeting certain financial tests in future quarters  including but not limited to  the mlp senior secured notes restricted payment test 
depending on the circumstances  the partnership would pursue alternatives to permit the continued payment of mqd to its common unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives will be successful with respect to any given quarter 
on august   the subordination period will end and the subordinated units will convert to common units  provided that certain remaining financial tests  which are related to making the mqd on all common and subordinated units  are satisfied for each of the three consecutive four quarter periods ending on july  the partnership met such financial tests for the four quarter periods ended july  and july   respectively 
there can be no assurance that the partnership will meet the remaining financial tests in the subsequent four quarter period and that the subordinated units will convert to common units on august  future maintenance and working capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances and the working capital borrowing facility 
in order to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  the olp may borrow on existing bank lines  the mlp or olp may issue additional debt or the mlp may issue additional common units 
toward this purpose the mlp maintains a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for  common units representing limited partner interests in the mlp 
the common units may be issued from time to time by the mlp in connection with the olp s acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended july   compared to  in the prior year 
this small decrease was primarily due to the decreased inventory and increased accounts payable partially offset by decreased net income as compared to july  these results were caused primarily by a decrease in propane prices  the decrease in volumes held in inventory and reduced retail volume activity as compared to those experienced during fiscal investing activities 
the partnership made total acquisition capital expenditures of  including  of working capital during fiscal this amount was funded by  cash payments   in common units and  in other costs and consideration 
during the year ended july   the partnership made growth and maintenance capital expenditures of  primarily for the following purposes additions to partnership owned customer tanks and cylinders  relocating and upgrading district plant facilities  upgrading computer equipment and software and vehicle lease buyouts 
capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment are relatively low since technological change is limited and the useful lives of propane tanks and cylinders  the partnership s principal physical assets  are generally long 
the partnership maintains its vehicle and transportation equipment fleet by leasing light and medium duty trucks and tractors 
the partnership believes vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting the partnership s transportation equipment needs 
the partnership continues to seek expansion of its operations through strategic acquisitions of smaller retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
these acquisitions will be funded through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional partnership interests 
the partnership does not have any material commitments of funds for capital expenditures other than to support the current level of operations 
in fiscal  the partnership does not expect a significant increase in growth and maintenance capital expenditures as compared to fiscal levels 
financing activities 
on august   the olp issued  of new privately placed unsecured senior notes new senior notes and entered into a  revolving credit facility new credit facility with its existing banks 
the proceeds of the new senior notes  which include five series with maturities ranging from year through at an average fixed interest rate of  were used to redeem  of olp fixed rate senior notes senior notes issued in july  including a call premium  and to repay outstanding indebtedness under the existing olp revolving credit facility credit facility 
as a result of these financings  the partnership expects to realize a decrease in interest expense during fiscal see note e to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the new senior notes and the new credit facility 
on july   all of the outstanding common stock of ferrell was purchased by a newly established esot 
as a result of this change in control in the ownership of ferrell and indirectly in the general partner  the mlp  pursuant to the mlp senior secured note indenture  was required to offer to purchase the outstanding notes at a price of of the principal amount thereof 
see note e to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details regarding the offer to purchase the mlp senior secured notes 
during the fiscal year ended july   the partnership borrowed  under its  credit facility to fund expected seasonal working capital needs  business acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
in addition  letters of credit outstanding  used primarily to secure obligations under certain insurance arrangements  totaled  giving affect to the issuance of the new senior notes and the new credit facility completed august   the olp would have had  million available for general corporate  acquisition and working capital purposes under the new credit facility at july  the partnership typically has significant cash needs during the first quarter due to expected low revenues  increasing inventories and the partnership s cash distribution paid in mid september 
on april   the mlp issued the mlp senior secured notes 
these notes will be redeemable at the option of the partnership  in whole or in part  at any time on or after june  interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december to offset the variable rate characteristic of the revolving credit facility borrowings  the olp has entered into interest rate collar agreements  expiring between october and december with two major banks  that effectively limit interest rates on a certain notional amount between and under the current pricing arrangement 
at july   the total notional principal amount of these agreements was  during the year ended july   the partnership paid cash distributions of per limited partner unit 
these distributions covered the period from may  to april  on august   the partnership declared its fourth quarter cash distribution of per limited partner unit  which was paid september  the partnership s annualized distribution is presently per limited partner unit 
the mlp senior secured notes  new senior notes and new credit facility contain various restrictive covenants applicable to the mlp  the operating partnership and its subsidiaries  the most restrictive relating to additional indebtedness  sale and disposition of assets  and transactions with affiliates 
the mlp and the operating partnership are in compliance with all requirements  tests  limitations and covenants related to the mlp senior secured notes  the new senior notes and new credit facility 
the new senior notes and the new credit facility agreements have similar restrictive covenants to the senior notes and credit facility agreements that were replaced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the partnership s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices 
additionally  the partnership seeks to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on variable rate debt by entering into interest rate collar agreements 
after giving effect to the refinancing of the debt that occurred in august  the partnership had redeemed nearly all of the variable rate debt outstanding at july  moreover  as of the date of this form k  the partnership had only  notional amount of interest rate collar agreements effectively outstanding 
thus  assuming a material change in the variable interest rate to the partnership  the interest rate risk related to the variable rate debt and the associated interest rate collar agreements is not material to the financial statements 
the partnership s trading activities utilize certain types of energy commodity forward contracts and swaps traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or exchange to anticipate market movements  manage and hedge its exposure to the volatility of floating commodity prices and to protect its inventory positions 
the partnership s non trading activities utilize certain over the counter energy commodity options to limit overall price risk and to hedge its exposure to inventory price movements 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily for compliance with the partnership s trading policy 
this policy includes specific dollar exposure limits  limits on the term of various contracts and volume limits for various energy commodities 
the partnership also utilizes loss limits and daily review of open positions to manage exposures to changing market prices 
market and credit risk 
nymex traded futures are guaranteed by the exchange and have nominal credit risk 
the partnership is exposed to credit risk associated with futures  swaps and option transactions in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
for each counterparty  the partnership analyzes the financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of each limit 
the change in market value of exchange traded futures contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with brokers 
forwards and most other over the counter instruments are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
sensitivity analysis 
the partnership has prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of its energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options were analyzed assuming a hypothetical change in forward prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions from a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities is estimated at  as of july  actual results may differ 
further discussion of the risk management activities and accounting for derivative commodity contracts is contained in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements
