the company has a million revolving line of credit for borrowings and to support the commercial paper program 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under either source 
the primary objectives for the company s investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the company  consistent with these two objectives 
the company s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
the company invests its excess cash in securities with varying maturities to meet projected cash needs 
the company believes that existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of debt financing are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future  as well as to support its stock repurchase program 
however  the company may raise additional capital from time to time 
results of operations product sales product sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
in  product sales were  million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
neupogen r filgrastim worldwide neupogen r sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to demand growth and higher prices 
unfavorable foreign currency effects and european union eu government initiatives to lower health care expenditures reduced growth in eu sales 
in addition  the company believes that the use of protease inhibitors as a treatment for aids has reduced sales of neupogen r for off label use as a supportive therapy in this setting 
neupogen r is not approved or promoted for such use  except in australia and canada 
in  sales were  million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to growth in demand and a price increase 
cost containment pressures in the us health care marketplace have contributed to the slowing of growth in domestic neupogen r usage over the past several years 
these pressures are expected to continue to influence growth for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly neupogen r sales volume is influenced by a number of factors including underlying demand and wholesaler inventory management practices 
the growth of the colony stimulating factor csf market in the eu in which neupogen r competes has slowed  principally due to eu government pressures on physician prescribing practices in response to on going government initiatives to reduce health care expenditures 
additionally  the company faces competition from another granulocyte csf product 
amgen s csf market share in the eu has remained relatively constant over the last year  however  the company does not expect the competitive intensity to subside in the near future 
epogen r epoetin alfa epogen r sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
epogen r sales during this period benefited from increases in the us dialysis patient population  but were adversely affected by reimbursement changes implemented on september  by the health care financing administration hcfa 
prior to these changes  fiscal intermediaries under contract with hcfa were authorized to pay reimbursement claims for patients whose hematocrits were above percent  the top of the suggested target hematocrit range in the company s labeling  if deemed medically justified 
under the new rules  medical justification is no longer accepted for payment of claims of hematocrits that exceed percent  and if the current month s hematocrit is greater than percent and the patient s hematocrit exceeds percent on an historical day rolling average basis  reimbursement for the last days will be denied in full 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company has experienced a decline in the growth rate of epogen r sales as dialysis providers attempt to lower hematocrits by lowering or withholding epogen r doses in order to avoid or minimize claim denials under the new hcfa policy 
the company anticipates that dialysis providers will continue to administer lowered doses or withhold doses to maintain hematocrits at a level which  in their judgment  is sufficiently low to avoid or minimize claim denials 
it is difficult to predict epogen r usage under this reimbursement policy principally because individual patient hematocrit variability is high and thus difficult to control or maintain at a desired level  and the response by dialysis providers has varied 
in  epogen r sales were  million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the us dialysis patient population  the administration of higher doses and  to a lesser extent  increased penetration of the dialysis market 
other product sales sales of infergen r interferon alfacon  the company s third product  were million in  much of which was to fill distribution channels 
infergen r was launched in october for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus infection 
there are existing treatments for this infection against which infergen r competes  and the company cannot predict the extent to which it will penetrate this market 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  cost of sales as a percentage of product sales is expected to be slightly higher than research and development in and  research and development expenses increased million or and million or  respectively  compared with the respective prior years 
these increases are primarily due to higher clinical and preclinical activities  including staff related expenses  necessary to support ongoing product development activities 
in  annual research and development expenses are expected to increase but at a substantially lower rate than this increase is planned for internal development of product candidates  and for discovery and licensing efforts 
marketing and selling general and administrative in  marketing and selling expenses decreased million or from the prior year due to lower european marketing expenses resulting from the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates and lower expenses related to the johnson johnson arbitration 
these reductions were partially offset by higher staff related costs and higher outside marketing expenses 
in  marketing and selling expenses increased million or over the prior year primarily due to market research activities  efforts to increase the number of patients receiving neupogen r and efforts to bring more patients receiving epogen r within the target hematocrit range 
in and  general and administrative expenses increased million or and million or  respectively  compared with the respective prior years 
these increases are primarily due to higher staff related expenses and legal fees 
in  marketing and selling expenses combined with general and administrative expenses are expected to have little growth 
legal assessment during the three months ended september   the company recorded a pre tax charge of million relating to a spillover arbitration award to johnson johnson 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contingencies johnson johnson arbitrations 
income taxes the company s tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to the effect of the legal assessment which reduced pre tax income without a corresponding reduction in tax benefits related to puerto rico operations and due to higher federal research and experimentation tax credits resulting from favorable legislation extending the credit for the entire year as compared with only six months for the decrease in is primarily the result of a favorable ruling received from the puerto rican government with respect to tollgate taxes applicable to earnings in puerto rico 
the tax rate reflects tax benefits from the sale of products manufactured in the puerto rico fill and finish facility which began in the first quarter of for  the tax rate is likely to increase to approximately primarily due to a provision in the us federal tax law which caps tax benefits associated with the company s puerto rico operations at the income level 
foreign currency transactions the company has a program to manage certain portions of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from international operations 
the company generally hedges the receivables and payables with foreign currency forward contracts  which typically mature within six months 
the company uses foreign currency option and forward contracts which generally expire within months to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
at december   outstanding foreign currency option and forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
year the year issue results from computer programs that do not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer systems that have time sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year the company has conducted an initial review of its computer systems  devices  applications and manufacturing equipment collectively  computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by year noncompliance 
additionally  the company has appointed a program manager for year compliance and is presently assessing in detail the affected computer systems and is developing plans to address the required modifications 
the company presently intends to utilize internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram and test its computer systems for year compliance 
the total cost associated with year compliance is not known at this time 
although the company has communicated with all known suppliers  service providers  distributors  wholesalers and other entities with which it has a business relationship collectively  third party businesses regarding compliance with year requirements  the company has not determined the impact  if any  on its operations if third party businesses fail to comply with year requirements 
while the company has developed plans to complete modifications of its business critical computer systems prior to the year  if modifications of such business critical computer systems  or computer systems of key third party businesses are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial position of the company 
financial outlook future neupogen r filgrastim sales growth is dependent primarily upon further penetration of existing markets  the timing and nature of additional indications for which the product may be approved and the effects of competitive products 
although not approved or promoted for use in amgen s domestic or foreign markets  except for australia and canada  the company believes that approximately of its worldwide neupogen r sales are from off label use as a supportive therapy to various aids treatments 
changes in aids therapies  including protease inhibitors that may be less myelosuppressive  are believed to have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect such sales 
neupogen r usage is expected to continue to be affected by cost containment pressures on health care providers worldwide 
in addition  reported neupogen r sales will continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and government budgets 
the company anticipates a single digit sales growth rate for epogen r epoetin alfa in the company also anticipates that  without any modifications to the reimbursement changes implemented by hcfa  additional sales growth due to dose  if any  is likely to be minimal  however  the company believes that increases in the us dialysis patient population will continue to grow epogen r sales in the near term and long term 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  epogen r sales may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
the previously disclosed report of the office of the inspector general has been issued  recommending a reduction in the medicare reimbursement rate for epogen r 
the company believes the recommendation would primarily affect dialysis providers and that it is difficult to predict the impact on amgen 
infergen r interferon alfacon was launched in october for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus infection 
there are existing treatments for this infection against which infergen r competes  and the company cannot predict the extent to which it will penetrate this market 
the company is presently engaged in certain litigation related to infergen r  as described in item legal proceedings infergen r litigation 
the company anticipates a single digit total product sales growth rate for without giving effect to the legal assessment  earnings per share in is expected to grow at a rate between high single and low double digits 
estimates of future product sales and earnings per share  however  are necessarily speculative in nature and are difficult to predict with accuracy 
in october  the company announced that it is seeking a corporate partner for its inflammation research and development program located in boulder  colorado  which includes the product candidates il ra interleukin receptor antagonist  stnfr soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor and slpi secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor
