item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments executive management changes on march   keith e 
alessi executed an agreement to become the chairman  chief executive officer and president of the company 
concurrent with mr 
alessi s hiring  j 
brian o neill resigned as chairman  chief executive officer and president 
mr 
o neill has continued as a director 
mr 
alessi also purchased shares of the company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  or per share 
the company also granted mr 
alessi options exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of common stock  of which were granted under the company s equity compensation plan exercisable at a price of per share see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s ability to execute its plan and return to profitability is largely dependent on the efforts of its senior management team  including the efforts of mr 
alessi 
since mr

operational losses the company s operating results have deteriorated significantly since the first quarter of the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in the net loss was a million goodwill impairment charge and million in charges related to call center closings 
notwithstanding the foregoing charges  the company incurred operating losses in the company expects that it will continue to realize significant operating losses during the first two quarters of the company mainly attributes these losses to the costs associated with expanding its telemarketing call center capacity in the first and second quarters of to meet its growth expectations and the costs associated with subsequently reducing in the third and fourth quarters of the company determined to reduce its capacity when the company s largest customer  mbna  dramatically reduced its telemarketing programs with the company and the company was not able to procure new clients to fill its excess capacity 
the company also attributes these losses to decreased telemarketing rates resulting from industry pricing pressures and its acceptance of lower margin business in an effort to fill some of its overcapacity 
the company believes that there has been a significant decline in the growth in the outsourcing of teleservices 
this decline has resulted in overcapacity in the telemarketing industry and greater price competition 
the ability of the company to return to profitability will be dependent on its ability to implement its call center closings and achieve additional operating efficiencies  while maintaining or expanding its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will accomplish these objectives 
call center closings in the third and fourth quarters of  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling  in connection with company s decision to close seventeen call centers fifteen in the telemarketing segment and two in the customer care segment 
the charges include a non cash write down of  related to certain call center property and equipment  a  provision for noncancellable lease commitments at closed call centers  and a  provision relating to severance and termination benefits for certain employees 
the company has commenced activities necessary to implement the closing of the call centers and expects that all significant activities under the call center closing plan will be completed by no later than december   with a majority of these activities being completed by june  the company anticipates recording an additional provision relating to non cancellable lease commitments and for severance and termination benefits in the first quarter of related to call center closings see note to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations the company has determined to provide greater focus on its two business segments  telemarketing and customer care  and to raise funds to retire its bank debt 
in furtherance of these objectives  the company has recently consummated the sale of its two other principal business segments 
in february  the company consummated the sale of its market research segment to nco group  inc for million cash and a contingent payment based on the future operating performance of this business 
the results of operations for the market research segment have been reported separately as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and for the period from april  inception to december   respectively 
the company used the net proceeds from this sale to reduce short term debt 
on march  the company consummated the sale of its direct mail and fulfillment segment for million cash and a contingent payment based on the future operating performance of this business 
the results of operations for the direct mail and fulfillment segment have been reported separately as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and for the period from april  inception to december   respectively 
the company received the net proceeds from this sale on april  and applied the proceeds to fully pay off existing borrowings under its credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
default under prior credit facility  new credit facility on march   the company was notified by its primary lending institution  mellon bank na mellon  that the company was in default of certain loan covenants under its loan and security agreement the credit facility dated january   as amended 
the company repaid the entire outstanding balance under this facility on april  with the proceeds from the sale of its direct marketing and fulfillment segment 
on april   the company entered into a new credit facility with mellon which provides for an initial million credit facility that expires in april the credit facilty may be increased to million based upon satisfactory completion of certain due diligence procedures by mellon 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company can initially borrow up to the lesser of million or an amount that is determined as of the net accounts receivable aged days or less 
the company can draw down on the credit facility in increments of  or more 
the company can elect at the time of the draw down to pay interest at prime plus or at a libor rate plus and will pay a commitment fee of of the unused borrowing capacity 
the credit facility also makes available to the company letters of credit  which may be issued on the outstanding undrawn amount of the credit facility 
the letters of credit shall not exceed million and have a fee equal to per annum on the face amount of each letter of credit 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility also contains various financial and non financial covenants 
goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  which represented the goodwill associated with the telemarketing segment 
as of december   the remaining goodwill of  relates exclusively to the customer care segment 
the company has continually evaluated whether later events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
recently  the company performed an in depth evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill due to the company s poor operating performance  and the overall significant changes in the industry outlook 
the company has concluded that due to the significant decline in the growth in the telemarketing industry and the reduced growth prospects of the company  that a permanent impairment of goodwill has occurred 
in connection with this evaluation  the company elected to change its method of measuring goodwill impairment under apb opinion no 
intangible assets  from an undiscounted cash flow approach to a discounted cash flow approach effective december  the company believes the change to the fair value method based on a discounted cash flow approach is preferable in that such method most closely approximates the fair value of goodwill and the related measurement of goodwill impairment see note to the consolidated financial statements

the million of cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of million of purchase of property and equipment and million used to repay notes payable to sellers and other acquisition related liabilities

in addition  the company used million related to capital investments for discontinued operations 
as a result of the call center closings and consolidation of facilities discussed above  as of december   the company recorded an impairment charge of million of which million related to these additions 
given the consolidation of facilities  the company does not expect to make any significant investment in telemarketing call center expansion in in  the company intends to continue to invest in maintaining and enhancing its technology platforms

in addition  in june the company used million to invest in an ownership of the sampling business  which we sold in october for million resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million of net proceeds from borrowing under the company s credit facility dated january   as amended 
in addition  the company received million of proceeds from other long term debt and made payments on debt and capital lease obligations totaling approximately million 
throughout  the company amended the credit facility several times as a result of non compliance due to its operating performance 
on march   the company was notified by its primary lending institution  mellon bank na mellon  that the company was in default of certain loan covenants of its credit facility 
the company repaid this facility on april   with the proceeds from the sale of its direct mail and fulfillment segment 
on april   the company entered into a new credit facility with mellon which provides for an initial million credit facility that expires in april the credit facility may be increased to million based upon satisfactory completion of certain due diligence procedures by mellon 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company can initially borrow up to the lesser of million or an amount that is determined as of the net accounts receivable aged days or less 
the company can draw on the credit facility in increments of  or more 
the company can elect at the time of the draw to pay interest at prime plus or at a libor rate plus and will pay a commitment fee of or the unused borrowing capacity 
the credit facility also makes available to the company letters of credit  which may be issued on the outstanding undrawn amount of the credit facility 
the letters of credit shall not exceed million and have a fee equal to per annum on the face amount of each letter of credit 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility also contains various financial and non financial covenants 
in order to satisfy the financial covenants under this facility on a continuing basis  the company must successfully complete its current restructuring plans 
though the company believes it will remain in compliance with the credit facility covenants  there is no assurance the company will be able to satisfy such covenants 
the company believes that its existing cash balances  reflecting the sale of the two discontinued operations  and borrowings available under its april credit facility will be sufficient to meet its operating and capital needs into the amount of future capital expenditures will be highly dependent on future revenue growth 
the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures will be substantially less than expenditures 
other information risk factors results of operations while the company expects to be able to increase its capacity utilization  obtain and maintain higher revenue per hour business  maintain its relationships with existing clients  obtain new clients  manage its costs effectively  continue to grow its revenues  and return to profitability  there can be no assurance that it will be able to meet any or all of these objectives 
the company s telemarketing agreements with its clients generally do not assure that the company will achieve a specific level of revenue and generally are terminable by the clients on relatively short notice 
additionally  the amount of revenue the company generates from a particular client is dependent upon a number of factors  including  the ability of the company to achieve marketing and sales results required by the client and the results achieved by the company as compared to both the clients in house operations and or other competing out source service providers 
in addition to these factors  numerous agreements with its clients are also based on actual sales achieved 
accordingly  the ability of the company to achieve its desired results of operations is also contingent upon its telephone sales representatives being able to effectively and efficiently market the clients products combined with the quality of the lists of prospective customers provided by the company s clients 
the company is continuing its review of its costs  organizational structure and information technology in an effort to identify opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency 
while the company expects to achieve further cost reductions  there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully achieve its desired results 
reliance on major clients approximately of the company s revenues in were generated from one client  mbna 
substantially all of these revenues were generated in the first and second quarters of the significant reduction in the amount of business provided by mbna was a significant factor in the company s lower capacity utilization and operating performance during the last two fiscal quarters in although no current customer of the company represents more than of the company s revenues  the company may in the future develop relationships with clients that represent a large concentration of revenues 
since most client contracts can generally be canceled by the client upon relatively short notice  the company will be vulnerable to any unexpected termination or non renewal of such a relationship 
difficulties of managing rapid growth the company has experienced rapid growth over the past several years 
continued future growth will depend on a number of factors  including the company s ability to i initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships and expand its existing client programs  ii recruit  motivate and retain qualified management and hourly personnel  iii rapidly identify  acquire or lease suitable call center facilities on acceptable terms and complete build outs of such facilities in a timely and economic fashion  and iv maintain the high quality of the services and products that it provides to its clients 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth rate  effectively manage its expanding operations or maintain its profitability 
if the company is unable to maintain its historical growth rate or effectively manage its growth  its business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s profitability is influenced significantly by its call center capacity utilization 
the company attempts to maximize utilization  however  because almost all of the company s business is outbound  the company has significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
in addition  the company has experienced  and in the future may experience  at least short term  excess peak period capacity when it opens a new call center or terminates or completes a large client program 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain optimal call center capacity utilization 
need for additional financing the company currently estimates that its existing cash after the sale of discontinued operations together with proceeds available under the company s credit facility and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to finance its current operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that these sources will actually be sufficient to meet the company s needs  particularly if the company does not achieve its planned cost reductions or generate expected revenue levels 
if these sources are not sufficient  the company will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing and there can be no assurance given that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if additional financing is raised by issuing equity securities  existing shareholders may experience significant dilution 
quarterly results and seasonality the company s results of operations in any single interim period should not be viewed as an indication of future results of operations 
the company has in the past and may again in the future experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating profitability as a result of the timing of its clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses incurred to acquire and support such new business  and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
the company s business volumes tend to decrease in the first and third quarters of its fiscal year due to reduced levels of clients marketing programs which are typically slower in the post holiday and summer months  respectively 
the company is sensitive to seasonal downturns  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to predict or compensate for any such seasonal downturns 
reliance on technology the company has made significant investments in technology and anticipates that it will be necessary to continue making significant additional technology investments to remain competitive 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in anticipating continuing technological changes or in implementing new or enhanced technology  and the failure of the company to so anticipate or implement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
dependence on labor force the company s industry is very labor intensive and has experienced high personnel turnover 
many of the company s employees receive modest hourly wages and a significant number are employed on a part time basis 
a higher turnover rate among the company s employees would increase the company s recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity 
some of the company s operations  particularly insurance product sales and technology based inbound customer service  require specifically trained employees 
growth in the company s business will require it to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of the company s costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could materially adversely effect the company 
dependence on telephone service the company s business is materially dependent on service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of the company s services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could have a materially adverse impact on the company 
control by principal stockholder crw financial  inc crw beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  crw is able to exercise significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to the company s stockholders 
such voting concentration may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
risks associated with the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company does not believe that it has material exposure to the year issue with respect to its own information systems since its existing systems correctly define the year the company is in the process of conducting an analysis  which it expects to complete in  to determine the extent to which its customers and suppliers systems insofar as they relate to the company s business are subject to the year issue 
accordingly  the company is currently unable to predict the extent to which the year issue will affect its customers or suppliers  or to the extent to which it would be vulnerable to the failure of its customers or suppliers to remediate any year issues on a timely basis 
forward looking statements statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial results and financial condition and elsewhere in this form k  regarding capacity utilization rate  new clients  expected revenues  cost reductions  efficiencies and growth are forward looking statements that could involve substantial risk and uncertainty 
for these statements the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of the following are factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements agreements with its existing clients generally do not assure a specific level or duration of revenue  revenue assumptions may not be realized  cost reductions and efficiencies may not be achieved growth and profitability assumptions assume the addition of new clients not currently identified  and contracts may not be realized and capacity utilization rate may be adversely affected due to competitors actions or clients requirements
