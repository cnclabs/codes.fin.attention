inflation the majority of leases at the shopping center properties contain provisions for annual increases in rents and or provisions which may entitle mart to receive percentage rents based on the tenants gross sales 
such provisions ameliorate the risk to mart of the adverse effects of inflation 
if a recession were to begin and continue for a prolonged time  funds from operations could decline as some tenants may have trouble meeting their lease obligations 
most of the leases at the properties require the tenants to pay a substantial share of operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  and thereby reduce mart s exposure to increased costs 
in addition  many of the leases at the properties are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable mart to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases if rents are below the then existing market rates
