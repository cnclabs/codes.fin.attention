ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of the company s performance or as a measure of liquidity

under its regulations  hud has the authority to suspend or deny property owners and managers from participation in hud programs with respect to additional assistance within a geographic region through imposition of an ldp by any hud office or nationwide for violations of hud regulatory requirements 
in march  hud announced its intention to step up enforcement against property owners and managers who violate their agreements with hud  and  in july  hud announced the creation of a new department wide enforcement division 
three hud field offices have recently issued three ldps to nhp as a result of physical inspections and mortgage defaults at four properties owned by the nhp real estate companies  two of which are managed by the company 
one ldp was subsequently withdrawn and another was terminated in december after a reinspection of the property 
the one remaining ldp  unless lifted  suspends the company s ability to manage or acquire additional hud assisted properties in eastern missouri until june  the company has proposed a settlement agreement with hud which includes aggregate payments to hud of approximately million  and is awaiting hud s response 
the company cannot determine whether hud will accept the proposed settlement 
because an ldp is prospective  existing hud agreements are not affected  so an ldp is not expected to result in the loss of management service revenue from or to otherwise affect properties that the company currently manages in the subject regions 
if hud were to disapprove the company as property manager for one or more affordable properties  the company s ability to obtain property management revenues from new affordable properties may be impaired 
hud monitors the performance of properties with hud insured mortgage loans 
hud also monitors compliance with applicable regulations  and takes performance and compliance into account in approving management of hud assisted properties 
in this regard  since july  hud assisted properties owned or managed by the nhp real estate companies or nhp have defaulted on non recourse hud insured mortgage loans 
eight of these properties are also currently managed by the company 
an additional six properties owned or managed by the company have received unsatisfactory performance ratings 
as a result of the defaults and unsatisfactory ratings  the national hud office must review any field office approval of the company to act as property manager for a hud assisted property 
the national hud office has consistently approved nhp s applications to manage new properties  and the company received hud clearance to acquire nhp and the nhp real estate companies 
the company believes that it enjoys a good working relationship with hud and that the national office will continue to apply the clearance process to large management portfolios such as the company s  including nhp s  with discretion and flexibility 
while there can be no assurance  the company believes that the unsatisfactory reviews and the mortgage defaults will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
in october  nhp received a subpoena from the inspector general of hud the inspector general requesting documents relating to any arrangement whereby nhp or any of its affiliates provides or has provided compensation to owners of hud multi family projects in exchange for or in connection with management of a hud project 
the company believes that other owners and managers of hud projects have received similar subpoenas 
documents relating to certain of the company s acquisitions of property management rights for hud projects  may be responsive to the subpoena 
the company is in the process of complying with the subpoena and has provided certain documents to the inspector general  without conceding that they are responsive to the subpoena 
the company believes that its operations are in compliance  in all material respects  with all laws  rules and regulations relating to hud assisted or hud insured properties 
although the inspector general has not initiated any action against the company or  to the company s knowledge  any owner of a hud property managed by the company  if any such action is taken in the future  it could ultimately affect existing arrangements with respect to hud projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company 
environmental certain federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of building remodeling  renovation or demolition  impose certain worker protection and notification requirements and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air 
these laws also impose liability for a release of acms and may enable third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms 
in connection with the ownership  operation or management of properties  the company could be potentially liable for those costs 
there are acms at certain of the owned properties  and there may be acms at certain of the other aimco properties 
aimco has developed and implemented operations and maintenance programs  as appropriate  that establish operating procedures with respect to the acms at most of the owned properties  and intends to develop and implement  as appropriate  such programs at aimco properties that do not have such programs 
certain of the company s owned properties  and some of the other aimco properties  are located on or near properties that contain or have contained underground storage tanks or on which activities have occurred which could have released hazardous substances into the soil or groundwater 
there can be no assurances that such hazardous substances have not been released or have not migrated  or in the future will not be released or will not migrate  onto the aimco properties 
such hazardous substances have been released at certain owned properties and  in at least one case  have migrated from an off site location onto an owned property 
in addition  the company s montecito property in austin  texas  is located adjacent to  and may be partially on  land that was used as a landfill 
low levels of methane and other landfill gas have been detected at montecito 
the city of austin the city  the former landfill operator  has assumed responsibility for conducting all investigation and remedial activities to date associated with the methane and other landfill gas 
the remediation of the landfill gas is now substantially complete and the texas natural resources conservation commission tnrcc has preliminarily approved the methane gas remediation efforts 
final approval of the site and the remediation process is contingent upon the results of continued methane gas monitors to confirm the effectiveness of the remediation efforts 
should further actionable levels of methane gas be detected  a proposed contingency plan of passive methane gas venting may be implemented by the city 
the city has also conducted testing at montecito to determine whether  and to what extent  groundwater has been impacted 
based on test reports received to date by the company  the groundwater does not appear to be contaminated at actionable levels 
the company has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  liability for the landfill investigation and remediation  however  the company has relocated some of its tenants and has installed a venting system according to the tnrcc s specifications under the buildings slabs  in connection with the present raising of four of its buildings in order to install stabilizing piers thereunder  at a total cost of approximately  which is primarily the cost for the restabilization 
the restabilization was substantially completed in january the city will be responsible for monitoring the conditions of montecito 
all of the owned properties were subject to phase i or similar environmental audits by independent environmental consultants prior to acquisition 
the audits did not reveal  nor is the company aware of  any environmental liability relating to such properties that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  assets or results of operations 
the managed properties may not have been subject to phase i or similar environmental audits by independent environmental consultants 
however  the company is not aware of any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations relating to the managed properties 
in october  nhp received a letter the epa letter from the us department of justice doj which stated that the us environmental protection agency epa has requested that the doj file a lawsuit against nhp alleging  among other things  that nhp violated the clean air act  the national recycling and emissions reduction programs and associated regulations in connection with the employment of certain unlicensed personnel  maintenance and disposal of certain refrigerants  and record keeping practices at two properties 
a settlement in principle between nhp and the epa has been reached whereby nhp has agreed to pay a fine of less than  permit the epa to audit the maintenance records and technical staffing at nhp properties and continue to provide training to all maintenance workers with respect to the disposal of refrigerants 
a formal settlement agreement is expected to be executed in year compliance the company s management has determined that it will be necessary to modify or replace certain accounting and operational software and hardware to enable its computer systems to operate properly subsequent to december  as a result  management has appointed a team of internal staff to research and manage the conversion or replacement of existing systems to comply with year requirements 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations  and that transactions with tenants  suppliers and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company utilizes numerous accounting and reporting software packages and computer hardware to conduct its business  some of which already comply with year requirements 
management estimates that the modification or replacement of non compliant accounting and reporting software and hardware will total approximately million 
the company s management also believes that certain of the owned properties possess operational systems eg elevators  fire alarm and extinguishment systems and security systems which also must be modified or replaced in order to function properly after management is currently engaged in the identification of all non compliant operational systems  and has not yet determined the estimated cost of replacing or modifying such systems 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the company s apartment properties are for a period of six months or less  allowing  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rental rate and the opportunity to re lease the apartment unit at the prevailing market rate 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation and the company does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on its revenues
