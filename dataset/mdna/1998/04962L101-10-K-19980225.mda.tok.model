depending on the results of the company s research and development activities  the company may determine to accelerate or expand its efforts in one or more of its proposed areas and may therefore require additional funds earlier than presently anticipated 
management believes that the proceeds of the note offering  together with existing cash resources  will be sufficient to fund its operations through
