at december   craig had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  rei is majority owned by the company and  accordingly  is included in the consolidated financial statements of the company as of december  and however  craig and rei are separate public companies and each entity s capital resources and liquidity is legally independent of the other and any intercompany loans or receivables would require approval of each separate company s board of directors 
the stock transactions transferred the title of the above described assets from craig to rei  resulting in craig s assets being principally comprised of rei common and preferred stock 
accordingly  the future liquidity of craig is principally dependent on reading s ability to pay dividends in accordance with the terms of the reading preferred stock amounting to approximately  annually

the consolidated company  where feasible  prefers to own the land on which it constructs its cinemas 
in the united states and puerto rico  a variety of factors including land acquisition costs and competition from well established and well financed developers have caused the company to focus on leasehold sites 
however  an ownership oriented approach is being pursued in australia with respect to the consolidated company s entertainment center projects see item  business 
these projects will be more capital intensive  have longer lead times and entail greater development risks that the leasing of facilities in established malls 
the entertainment centers will generally consist of a multiplex cinema with complementary retail and restaurant use and convenient parking all constructed on land owned or controlled by the consolidated company 
accordingly  such centers are capital intensive at this stage of development 
reading australia has acquired three sites inclusive of a joint venture shopping center site  which the company may develop as entertainment centers  and has agreements relating to two other possible entertainment center sites 
reading australia also has a fifty acre property assemblage in the melbourne area 
the consolidated company is considering development options for this site 
however  if capital were required to fund the company s entertainment center or other projects  this site could be sold to fund such projects 
if all of these potential entertainment center projects are developed  reading australia estimates the total development cost exclusive of land costs for these projects will exceed million over the next two to three years 
the consolidated company anticipates that it will invest approximately  during in furtherance of its expansion of an existing cinevista theater scheduled to be completed in cinevista has also signed a lease agreement for a new twelve screen cinema  and has a letter of intent relating to an expansion of an existing location 
cinevista s share of the estimated costs of these two projects is approximately million and will be expended in and cinevista may use funds available under its line of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein to fund a portion of its theater development costs 
the consolidated company is actively seeking sites to develop angelika type theaters throughout the united states and will consider acquiring leasehold or ownership interests in conjunction with such developments 
in addition  the consolidated company may from time to time  develop theaters which specialize in conventional commercial film product if the consolidated company views the markets as attractive 
the consolidated company has entered into a lease for a site on which the consolidated company plans to build a twelve screen commercial cinema in new jersey 
the theater is presently under development and scheduled to open in late in addition  the consolidated company has entered into letters of intent relating to the development of angelika type cinemas with a total of screens in five locations 
the consolidated company s share of the development costs of these projects are estimated to total approximately million 
however  with the exception of the one commercial theater referred to above  it cannot be assured any of these projects will be completed as leases have not yet been executed 
the cash cost of the consolidated company s domestic cinema projects can range from approximately million for a turnkey leased facility to over million for an owned site 
if the consolidated company is successful in its efforts to develop all of the projects which it is presently considering  its capital requirements over the next three years will exceed its existing liquid funds and anticipated cash flow 
however  the consolidated company believes that additional funding could be realized through  among other things  bank borrowings  sale and lease back transactions and the issuance sale of additional equity either of craig  rei  reading australia or at the project level 
the following summarizes the major sources and uses of cash funds for the years ended december  and  the three months ended december  and the year ended september  fiscal unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased  in from  in to  at december  working capital increased  from  at december  to  at december  the principal source of liquid funds in was the  in proceeds from the redemption of the stater preferred stock investment inclusive of accrual dividends 
other sources of liquid funds in include  in payment of a litigation settlement   in interest and dividend income  and  from other income 
in addition to the payment of operating expenses the principal use of cash funds included the payment of  of dividends on the company s rei convertible preferred stock  the additional purchase of rei common stock amounting to  and purchases of a theater and property and equipment of   which relates to reading australia   relating to cinevista and  to the domestic cinemas  and the investment of  by reading australia in a joint venture and a loan to the joint venture partner with respect to an existing shopping center property which reading australia is considering as a potential site for redevelopment as an entertainment center intends to develop a multiplex cinema 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
fiscal unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased  in from  at december  to  at december  due primarily to the effects of the accounting for the stock transactions 
such purchase resulted in the company consolidating the assets and liabilities of reading in the financial statements  which had the effect of increasing cash and cash equivalents by approximately  net of the company s cash outlays for such purchases amounting to approximately  principal sources of liquid funds in were i dividends on the stater preferred stock and consulting fees from stater amounting to approximately  and  respectively  ii interest income amounting to million  iii  in other income  iv million in proceeds from the sale of rei series a preferred stock  and v  from the redemption of the citadel series b preferred stock 
additionally  principal sources of liquid funds included a net increase of  in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in addition to operating expenses  other uses of liquid funds in included the repurchase of the company s common stock amounting to approximately  the purchase of the angelika for  total purchase price of  net of a credit of  for a judgment secured by a portion of the stock of the seller of the angelika the angelika judgment and the minority member contribution of  purchases  primarily by reading australia  of  in property and equipment and a net increase in current assets of approximately  three months ended december  cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately  during the three months ended december  primarily as a result of i additional acquisitions of chc common stock and reading common stock amounting to  and  respectively  ii repurchases of the company s common stock amounting to approximately  and iii the liabilities and purchase by reading australia of services and land financed in part by a contractual land obligation 
fiscal cash and cash equivalents decreased  from  at september  to  at september  principal sources of funds during fiscal included service income from sbh of  and interest and dividend income of approximately  during fiscal  the company agreed to acquire in partial satisfaction of a loan made to citadel   shares of newly issued chc preferred stock in the amount of  in fiscal the company received interest earnings and dividend income from citadel amounting to  as a result of its ownership of chc preferred stock and loans made to citadel 
in addition  the company received  from citadel in repayment of all outstanding loans 
in addition to operating expenses  principal uses of funds during fiscal were  for the acquisition of reading common stock and million for the acquisition of citadel common stock 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for approximately  the reorganization and stock transactions the reorganization of rei was effected in order to consolidate reading s operations under a holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
the consolidated company believes that such a structure would facilitate the financing of rei  by permitting it to seek new capital without subjecting the new capital to the contingent liabilities of reading company s historical railroad businesses  and permit rei to avail itself of a more established body of corporate law than that of pennsylvania the state in which reading company is incorporated 
pursuant to the stock transactions  rei received million of cash from citadel 
in return rei issued to citadel  million in stated value  shares of rei s series a preferred stock and granted citadel certain contractual rights including the asset put option 
the asset put option grants citadel the right to require rei to acquire substantially all of citadel s assets and assume related liabilities in return for the issuance of rei common stock at any time through a date days after rei files its annual report on form k 
the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the appraised value of the citadel assets or million  whichever amount is lower  by 
if the appraised value of the citadel assets is in excess of million  rei will issue common stock at fair market value for such excess up to a total of million in citadel assets 
in addition  rei agreed to exchange the citadel preferred stock  which was acquired from craig in the stock transactions  for citadel s series b preferred stock containing terms modified in certain respects from the terms of the chc preferred stock 
rei received from craig the stater preferred stock with a stated value of million the chc preferred stock with a stated value of million and craig s interest in reading international 
in return  rei issued to craig   shares of common stock and  shares  stated value of series b voting cumulative preferred stock the series b preferred stock 
certain financial reporting and tax considerations the reorganization and stock transactions have been accounted for as a purchase 
the book value of the assets transferred by craig to rei were as follows citadel preferred stock  stater bros 
preferred stock  ownership interest in reading international gross book value of assets received  plus accrued and unpaid dividends the stock transactions are intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in a exchange  the party acquiring the assets in the stock transactions  rei retains the contributing parties tax basis in the acquired assets  with no taxable gain recognized as a result of the exchange 
the parties contributing assets in the stock transactions  craig and citadel obtain a basis in the assets received in the exchange equal to the basis in the assets which are contributed in the exchange the series a and series b preferred stock 
with the exception of the stater preferred stock  the book value of the assets received in the stock transactions approximated the tax basis in the assets received 
craig s adjusted tax basis for federal tax purposes in the stater preferred stock was approximately million 
the estimated federal tax liabilities associated with the assets transferred in the stock transactions was approximately million  primarily relating to the stater preferred stock 
at the time of the closing of the stock transactions  rei had a gross deferred federal tax asset of million and a tax asset valuation allowance the tava in the same amount 
upon receipt of the stater preferred stock  it was determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset which had previously been fully reserved  would be realized and rei reduced the tava by million which amount reflects the amount of federal tax loss carryforwards nols which were expected to be utilized net of million in alternative minimum tax amt 
the acquisition of the reading securities by craig has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values  after consideration of the recognition by rei of previously reserved deferred tax assets as of the date of the stock transactions 
the aggregate purchase price for financial statement purposes of the fiscal purchases of rei stock by the company amounted to approximately million  of which approximately million represented the carrying value of the assets contributed in the exchange amounting to approximately million  net of the federal tax liabilities amounting to approximately million 
accordingly  the purchase  for financial statement purposes  resulted in negative goodwill in the amount of approximately million  which goodwill was allocated to reduce the carrying value of previously reported intangible assets related to craig s reading stock purchases and to reduce the fair value of the beneficial leases and leasehold improvements purchased 
in december  the stater preferred stock was contributed to reading australia 
management believes that the gain for federal tax purposes resulting from that transfer was offset by rei s nol carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of rei has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs would agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of the company 
while the transfer restrictions which are applicable to reading s equity securities are intended to minimize the risk of such ownership changes  ownership changes unknown to the company may have occurred despite or in violation of such restrictions 
in addition  the code and related case law limit the ability to use nols to offset certain built in gains on contributed property 
although the consolidated company does not believe that such limitations on the use of its nols applied to the contribution by rei of the stater preferred stock to reading australia  there can be no assurance that the irs would not take a different position 
also  if the irs were to determine that the principal purpose of the stock transactions was to make use of the nols and the consolidated company could not show otherwise  such use may not be available 
in such case  the financial position of the consolidated company could be materially adversely affected 
rei issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for the assets received in the stock transactions 
the series a preferred stock issued to citadel has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if rei fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
in addition to issuing to citadel the series a preferred stock  rei also granted the asset put option  which under certain circumstances permits citadel to exchange substantially all of its assets for rei common stock 
for financial statement purposes no value was allocated to the asset put option due in part to the subjective nature of the assumptions utilized in option pricing models and the fact that stock option valuation models are intended to value options and the asset put option is not transferable 
computer systems the company has determined that it will not need to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also does not believe that the failure of any third party suppliers or other parties to remediate year issues will have a material impact upon the company s operations 
effects on inflation the company does not believe that inflation has a material effect upon its existing operations
