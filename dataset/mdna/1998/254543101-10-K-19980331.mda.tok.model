the company intends to continue to explore marketing methods to use vishay s resources combined with planned enhancements to its own engineering and manufacturing capabilities  to develop ever more advanced products  to enhance product quality  and to further enhance customer service 
the relationship with vishay has already provided opportunities for the company to have its products offered by some the world s largest distributors 
in july  general semiconductor corporation  formerly general instrument corporation  announced that it would acquire the discrete semiconductor business of itt  one of the company s major suppliers 
as a result of this announcement  itt notified the company of their intent to terminate their distribution agreement with the company under the terms of the contract  although the company continues to receive product from the new owners of itt 
see item business manufacturing and significant vendors 
the company will continue its strategic plan of locating alternate sources of its products  including those provided by itt 
while the sale of itt may negatively impact the company s sales by approximately million  it is anticipated that the lost sales may be offset substantially by the company s projected increase in sales as well as by new sources of products in alternate sources for itt products include  but are not limited to  kaihong and other sourcing agreements in place as well as those under negotiation 
the company continually evaluates alternative sources of its products to assure its ability to deliver high quality  cost effective products

due to the success of the first phase of kaihong as well as prevailing market conditions  the company s board of directors has approved funding for further expansion of the joint venture 
the equipment expansion will allow for the manufacturer of additional sot packaged components as well as other surface mount packaging 
the capital required for the second and third phases of kaihong is estimated at million and the company s credit facility will be used to finance the additional manufacturing capacity 
also due to the recent success of the facility and through an arrangement in accordance with the original joint venture agreement previously filed  the company increased its controlling interest in kaihong from to  and increased its equity contribution to approximately million in the fourth quarter of the purchase price  as per the joint venture agreement  was approximately million and resulted in approximately million in goodwill 
also during the last quarter of  the kaihong joint venture began shipments of products to customers other than the company  and thus has begun to contribute to the company s consolidated sales 
it is anticipated that with the approved additional manufacturing capacity  future sales will continue to be made to unaffiliated customers  as well as to the company

the company purchases products from foreign suppliers primarily in united states dollars 
to a limited extent  and from time to time  the company contracts eg a portion of the equipment purchases for the kaihong expansion in foreign currencies  and  accordingly  its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
due to the limited number of contracts denominated in foreign currencies and the complexities of currency hedges  the company has not engaged in hedging to date 
if the volume of contracts written in foreign currencies increases  and the company does not engage in currency hedging  any substantial increase in the value of such currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
management believes that the current contracts written in foreign currency are not significant enough to justify the costs inherent in currency hedging 
the company s imported products are also subject to united states customs duties and  in the ordinary course of business  the company from time to time is subject to claims by the united states customs service for duties and other charges 
the company attempts to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by  among other things  contracting in us dollars  and  when possible  maintaining multiple sourcing of product groups from several countries 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue yk and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
yk is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for the year compliance 
confirmation have been requested from the company s primary processing vendors that plans are being developed to address processing of transactions in the year management is in the process of assessing the year compliance expense and related potential effect on the company s earnings 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the yk will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  yk may have a material impact on the operations of the company
