certain statements in the following discussion that are not historical in fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements regarding the company  its business  prospects and results of operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by many factors and events that could cause the company s actual business  prospects and results of operations to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed below and under business risk factors and in periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
cyclical nature of medical malpractice insurance industry many factors influence the financial results of the medical malpractice insurance industry  several of which are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include  among other things  changes in severity and frequency of claims  changes in applicable law and regulatory reform  changes in judicial attitudes toward liability claims  and changes in inflation  interest rates and general economic conditions 
the availability of medical malpractice insurance  or the industry s underwriting capacity  is determined principally by the industry s level of capitalization  historical underwriting results  returns on investment and perceived premium rate adequacy 
historically  the financial performance of the medical malpractice industry has tended to fluctuate between a soft insurance market and a hard insurance market 
in a soft insurance market  competitive conditions could result in premium rates and underwriting terms and conditions that may be below profitable levels 
for a number of years  the medical malpractice insurance industry in california has faced a soft insurance market 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when industry conditions will improve or the extent to which any improvement in industry conditions may improve the company s financial condition and results of operations 
changing nature of the business the vast majority of the company s business is professional liability insurance for physicians written on a claims made and reported basis 
the company believes that the integration of healthcare delivery in recent years  particularly in california  will result in the growing importance of large medical groups and other healthcare entities  and a corresponding change in the entities that make professional liability purchasing decisions 
the company believes that these changes have created a need for the company to further diversify 
as a result  the company has adopted a strategy for growth that includes expanding the type of products offered by the company and diversifying geographically by offering products in states other than california 
the company began to implement its strategy in by offering professional liability insurance to hospitals in california and  in  began offering errors and omissions coverage for managed care organizations 
in august  the company entered into a marketing arrangement with sullivan  kelly associates ska to expand its business to other states 
under the agreement  ska had the exclusive right to market the company s malpractice coverage for hospitals in all states  and the company recognized ska as the exclusive broker for medical group coverage in all states other than california 
in december  ska filed for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court  central district of california  and its assets were acquired by another insurance company in september in a court approved transaction 
effective october   the company and ska mutually agreed to terminate their exclusive marketing agreement 
the company now actively markets its hospital policies under a new program directly and through regional and local brokers  and must compete with ska and a number of insurance companies in the underwriting of hospital malpractice policies 
american healthcare indemnity company ahi  a subsidiary of scpie holdings  has formed a relationship with poe brown  inc poe brown one of the nation s top independent insurance agency organizations  to provide professional liability insurance to physicians commencing january  this coverage is offered to solo physicians and medical groups in eight states  the largest being connecticut  florida and georgia 
this replaces an existing program poe brown had established with another insurance company 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will successfully retain or expand this business through poe brown or that it will ultimately be profitable 
in addition  ahi has acquired the medical malpractice insurance business of fremont indemnity company fremont through a purchase agreement effective january  simultaneously  a quota share reinsurance agreement went into effect  making scpie indemnity the reinsurer for the fremont policies pending regulatory approval of ahi to write this business directly 
the fremont policies are written through brokers in states the vast majority in california and arizona 
competitive environment the california medical malpractice insurance market for medical groups and physicians  in which the company principally operates  has become extremely competitive in recent years 
the company s principal competitors are three physician owned companies and a physicians mutual protection trust 
in addition  commercial insurance companies have recently returned to the california market to insure medical groups and physicians 
in the late s  many medical malpractice insurance companies began to experience significantly improved claims cost trends and attempted to attract medical groups and physicians insured by other companies by reducing premium rates 
beginning in  the company implemented annual rate decreases aggregating more than during the next three years  which resulted in a reduction in premium volume to approximately million in  and a deterioration of underwriting results 
between and  however  scpie instituted annual overall rate increases ranging from to in order to improve its underwriting results 
these rate increases were higher than those implemented by most of its competitors 
as a result  the company has lost some of its policyholders  in part due to these rate increases  but realized a modest increase in its premium volume and has improved its underwriting results 
the company partially offset the effect of these rate increases through the payment of dividends to the members of the exchange in the form of premium credits based on the actual results of prior policy years 
in  the board of governors of the exchange declared a final dividend to members of the exchange of record on november   which was paid in the form of premium credits in this dividend of approximately million offset by a million credit for forfeited dividends declared in was reflected as an expense in the year ended december  the company has ceased paying such premium credit dividends to its policyholders 
therefore  the company may find it more difficult to compete with other insurance companies offering such dividends 
the company has instituted no rate increases for  which may offset the elimination of dividends to policyholders and somewhat improve its competitive position 
loss and lae reserves medical malpractice and other property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves are established based on known facts and interpretation of circumstances  including the company s experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments and pending levels of unpaid claims  as well as court decisions and economic conditions 
the effects of inflation are considered in the reserving process 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
the company follows a practice of conservatively estimating its future liabilities relating to losses already incurred and has attempted to establish its loss and lae reserves at the upper end of a reasonable range of reserve estimates 
the company believes that it has been particularly difficult to make such estimates for medical malpractice claims in california because of the uncertain benefits of tort reform measures and more recently a change in the judicial process 
the company believes that a combination of these and other factors have contributed to the recent redundancies in reserves established by scpie for prior years 
the original reserves were established without full knowledge of the effect of these factors 
redundant reserves  which have been released in every year since  have contributed significantly to reported earnings in recent years 
the company reduced reserves for prior years by million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company cannot predict whether similar redundancies will be experienced in future years 
the company continues to establish its loss and lae reserves at what it believes is the upper end of a reasonable range of reserve estimates  but there is no assurance that such reserves will ultimately prove to be redundant 
the company believes that some reduction in the amount of the redundancies recently experienced is reasonably likely 
if such redundancies do not occur or loss and lae experience does not improve  the company s net income could be significantly reduced or a net loss could occur 
operating expenses with its continued expansion into other states and markets  the company has experienced an increase in its operating expense levels to achieve and service this expansion 
commissions for policies that are sold through agents and brokers typically range from to of premiums  whereas the company does not incur commissions on products sold directly 
hospital and other healthcare provider policies are typically sold through brokers  as are physicians and medical group policies sold through poe brown and in the program acquired from fremont 
to the extent that these policies represent an increased percentage of the company s business in the future  expense ratios will increase 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  premiums earned premiums earned increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in the increase was due to a million increase in hospital medical malpractice premiums and an increase of million in assumed reinsurance 
medical malpractice premiums from physicians and medical groups were approximately million in compared to million in an average increase in premium rates in effect during was offset by a decrease in the average number of policies in force during as compared to hospital medical malpractice premiums were approximately million in compared to million in assumed reinsurance premiums were approximately million  which includes million of assumed hospital premiums in compared to less than million in net investment income net investment income increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in invested assets increased million to million in from million at december  the average pretax yield on the investment portfolio decreased to in compared to in primarily due to lower yielding  tax exempt bonds 
realized investment gains and other revenue realized investment gains were approximately million in compared to million in approximately million of the gains from resulted from the sale of equity securities in connection with the company s decision in the first quarter of to increase the focus of its investment portfolio on fixed maturity securities 
in sales were made in the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio to reposition the portfolio by increasing the percentage of tax exempt securities 
losses and lae losses and lae increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of premiums earned  losses and lae increased to in from for the same period in for  the company reduced loss and lae reserves incurred in prior policy years approximately million as compared to a reserve reduction of million for for claims incurred in prior policy years 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was principally attributable to increases in policy acquisition expenses  payroll benefit expenses  and legal and consultation fees of million  million  and million  respectively 
the ratio of other operating expenses to premiums earned is referred to as the expense ratio  which was in and in policyholder dividends the governing board of the exchange declared a final dividend to members of the exchange of record on november   who were also members of the exchange during policy years through such dividend was paid in the form of premium credits during this dividend of million offset by a million credit for forfeited dividends declared in was reflected as an expense for the year ended december  federal income taxes federal income taxes decreased million  or  to million in from million in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in  due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest in year ended december   compared to year ended december  premiums earned premiums earned increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in the increase was principally due to a million increase in assumed reinsurance premiums 
medical malpractice premiums from physicians and medical groups were approximately million in compared to million in an average increase in premium rates in effect during was offset by a decrease in the average number of policies in force during as compared to hospital medical malpractice premiums were approximately million in compared to million in assumed reinsurance premiums were approximately million in compared to less than million in net investment income net investment income  after a million interest expense accrual for a federal income tax settlement  increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in invested assets increased million to million in from million at december  the average pretax yield on the investment portfolio increased to in compared to in realized investment gains and other revenue realized investment gains were approximately million in compared to million in approximately million of the gains from resulted from the sale of equity securities in connection with the company s decision in the first quarter of to increase the focus of its investment portfolio on fixed maturity securities 
the remainder was attributable to sales made in the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio to take advantage of more favorable yields or to reposition the maturity of the portfolio 
losses and lae losses and lae decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of premiums earned  losses and lae decreased to in from for the same period in for  the company reduced loss and lae reserves incurred in prior policy years approximately million as compared to a reserve reduction of million for for claims incurred in prior policy years 
this reserve reduction of million was offset by a million reserve increase for free tail coverage to be provided by the company to currently insured physicians at the time of their death  disability or retirement 
this increase was the result of a refinement in the actuarial methodology used to calculate this reserve 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was principally attributable to increases in policy acquisition expenses and payroll benefit expenses of million and million  respectively  offset partially by lower legal fees of million 
the expense ratio was in and in policyholder dividends a final dividend to members of the exchange of million offset by a million credit for forfeited dividends declared in was reflected as an expense for the year ended december  dividends declared in prior years have been accrued as an expense for the period in which the related premiums were earned and not the year paid or declared 
accordingly  there is no expense reflected in federal income taxes federal income taxes increased million  or  to million in from million in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in  due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest in liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses  lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
the company has also paid significant dividends  in the form of premium credits  to its members in each year since the company paid million and million of such dividends during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has now ceased paying such premium credit dividends to its policyholders 
scpie has consistently experienced positive cash flow from operations 
because of uncertainty related to the timing of the payment of claims  cash from operations for a property and casualty insurance company can vary substantially from year to year 
cash provided by operating activities for scpie  before the payment of dividends to policyholders  was million in compared to million in the higher amount of cash flow from operations in was due to a refund of federal income tax and interest of million in settlement of a tax dispute for the through tax years 
the company invests its positive cash flow from operations in both fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
the company s current policy is to limit its investment in equity securities and real estate to no more than of the total market value of its investments 
accordingly  the company s portfolio of unaffiliated equity securities was reduced from million at december   to million at december  the company plans to continue this focus on fixed maturity securities for the indefinite future 
the company has made limited investments in real estate  which has been used almost entirely in the company s operating activities  with the remainder leased to third parties 
the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in high quality  short term securities to meet short term operating liquidity requirements  including the payment of losses and lae 
short term investments totaled million  or of invested assets  at december  the company believes that all of its short term and fixed maturity securities are readily marketable 
scpie holdings is an insurance holding company whose assets primarily consist of all of the capital stock of its insurance company subsidiaries and approximately million of net proceeds from a january common stock offering 
in  along with the net proceeds from the common stock offering  and dividends from its insurance subsidiaries  scpie has contributed million to american healthcare specialty insurance company and another million to ahi 
its principal sources of funds are dividends from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay in relation to earnings or surplus  without the consent of the applicable state regulatory authority  principally the california department of insurance 
scpie holdings principal insurance company subsidiary may pay dividends to scpie holdings in any year  without regulatory approval  to the extent such dividends do not exceed the greater of i of its statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year or ii its net income for the preceding year 
applicable regulations further require that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs  and permit the payment of dividends only out of statutory earned unassigned surplus unless the payment out of other funds receives regulatory approval 
the amount of dividends that the insurance company subsidiaries are able to pay to scpie holdings during without prior regulatory approval is approximately million 
dividends of million were paid during common stock dividends paid to stockholders were per share in these dividends are funded through dividends from the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the company expects to pay dividends in the future 
however  payment of dividends is subject to board approval  earnings and the financial condition of the company 
the company has received a commitment from a large lender for a bank facility in the amount of million 
the commitment is subject to certain terms and conditions as well as negotiation and completion of all documentation 
the company expects to use this facility for general corporate purposes 
based on historical trends  market conditions and its business plans  the company believes that its sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs over the next months and beyond 
however  because economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet these liquidity needs 
the short and long term liquidity requirements of the company may vary because of the uncertainties regarding the settlement dates for unpaid claims 
the company is in the process of seeking leased space for its operations 
the company has not entered into any commitments to date 
the company expects to use its cash flow from current operations to pay for any additional space and capital equipment 
during may  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its common stock in the open market 
the repurchase may begin at any time and continue until may during   shares were repurchased 
subsequent to december   an additional  shares were repurchased 
impact of year based on our assessments in prior years  the company has determined modification of significant portions of its software were required so that its computer systems would function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has utilized internal resources to reprogram  or replace and test  the software for year modifications 
the company estimates that approximately of the most important changes have been made and anticipates completing the entire project by december  the total cost of the year project since its inception in is estimated at million  of which approximately  was incurred through december  there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in or increased costs associated with the completion and implementation of such changes  and the company s inability to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
effect of inflation the primary effect of inflation on the company is considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement  such as medical malpractice claims 
the actual effect of inflation on the company s results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  the company believes that loss and lae reserve levels and the company s ratemaking process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation
