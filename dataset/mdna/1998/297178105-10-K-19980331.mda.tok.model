funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations an appropriate alternative measure of performance of an equity reit 
generally  funds from operations adjusts net income for non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization and non recurring gains or losses 
management generally considers funds from operations to be a useful financial performance measurement of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the performance of a reit and its ability to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined under gaap 
further  funds from operations as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of funds from operations 
the following table sets forth essex s calculation of actual funds from operations for  and for the year for the quarter ended ended december  december  september  june  march  income before minority interest      adjustments depreciation and amortization      adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures     non recurring items gains of the sales of real estate     other non recurring items    minority interest      funds from operations nareit revised definition      weighted average number of shares diluted      for the year for the quarter ended ended december  december  september  june  march  income before minority interest      adjustments depreciation and amortization      adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures      non recurring items gains of the sales of real estate     other non recurring items      minority interest pathways      funds from operations nareit revised definition      weighted average number of shares diluted      for the year for the quarter ended ended december  december  september  june  march  income before minority interest      adjustments depreciation and amortization      adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures    non recurring items gains of the sales of real estate    other non recurring items     minority interest pathways      funds from operations nareit revised definition      weighted average number of shares diluted      other non recurring items for the years ended december   and consists of   and  of loss from hedge termination and   and  of loss on the early extinguishment of debt  respectively 
these non recurring items are excluded from the funds from operations calculation since they are non operational in nature  infrequent in occurrence and inclusion would distort the comparative measurement of the company s performance over time 
assumes conversion of all outstanding operating partnership interests in the operating partnership and convertible preferred stock into shares of essex s common stock 
also includes common stock equivalents 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  a leading industry group  has approved a revised definition of funds from operations  which provides  in part  that the amortization of deferred financing costs is no longer to be added back to net income in the calculation of funds for operations 
consistent with the nareit recommendation essex has adopted this new definition beginning in the following table sets forth essex s calculation of actual funds from operations for  and using the revised definition
