item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has pursued an active acquisition program designed to take advantage of consolidation opportunities in the widely fragmented foundry industry 
the company has acquired seventeen foundries since its inception 
as a result of these completed transactions as well as internal growth  the company s net sales have increased from approximately million for its first full fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  as an important part of the company s growth strategy  the company evaluates on an ongoing basis potential industry related acquisitions 
while the company has not at the present time entered into any definitive agreement contemplating any such acquisition  the company is currently in various stages of negotiations with potential acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when any such negotiations will ultimately culminate in a definitive agreement or  if a definitive agreement is reached  whether any such acquisition will ultimately be consummated 
to complete any such acquisition  the company may use its revolving credit facility 
in the event that no further borrowings are available under the revolving credit facility  the company would consider other financing alternatives available at that time 
due to the large size of certain orders  the timing for deliveries of orders and the number and types of castings produced  the company s net sales and net income may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter 
generally  the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker than the other quarters as a result of plant shutdowns for maintenance at most of the company s foundries as well as at many customers plants 
see supplemental quarterly information 
during july  flooding of the missouri river halted production of the company s atchison  kansas foundry for four weeks  negatively impacting operating results 
although the company was able to resume production at the atchison facility without a significant loss of existing orders  the flood has had a continuing negative effect on productivity and sales due to increased equipment maintenance  production downtime and employee overtime 
the company constructed a flood wall surrounding the atchison facility that the company believes has significantly reduced the risk of future flood damage 
following the flood  the company was unable to renew its flood insurance coverage at reasonable rates for this facility

total indebtedness of the company at june  was million  as compared to million at june  this increase of million reflects indebtedness incurred of and million to finance the acquisitions of inverness and sheffield  respectively 
at june   million was available for borrowing under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company believes that its operating cash flow and amounts available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund its capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next two years 
however  the level of capital expenditure and working capital requirements may be greater than currently anticipated as a result of the size and timing of future acquisitions  or as a result of unforeseen expenditures relating to compliance with environmental laws 
acquisitions have been financed with borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and occasionally with common stock 
during fiscal  the company purchased primecast  of the outstanding capital stock of inverness and sheffield for million  million in addition to the payment and assumption of million of outstanding indebtedness and million in addition to  of subsidiary stock  respectively  in each case with available cash and funds available under the company s then existing revolving credit facility

london precision for us million cash  subject to adjustment 
london precision  located in london  ontario  canada  is an industrial machine shop which serves the locomotive  mining and construction  pulp and paper markets  among others 
the company financed this transaction with funds available under its revolving credit facility 
market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s floating rate debt obligations expose the company to interest rate risk 
to manage this potential risk  the company may use interest rate swap agreements to limit the effect of increases in interest rates on any of the company s us dollar floating rate debt by fixing the rate without the exchange of the underlying principal or notional amount 
net amounts paid or received are added to or deducted from interest expense in the period accrued 
the company s british subsidiary  sheffield  generates significant sales to customers outside of great britain whereby sheffield invoices and receives payment from those customers in their local currencies 
this creates foreign currency risk for sheffield 
to manage this risk sheffield uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge receipts and payments of foreign currencies related to sales to its customers and purchases from its vendors outside of great britain 
the company also has foreign currency exposure with respect to its net investment in sheffield 
this exposure is to changes in the british pound 
to manage a portion of this exposure the company entered into a combined interest rate and foreign currency swap 
the company also structures foreign balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk 
at june   the company had the following financial instruments with market risk exposure currency amounts in thousands principal notional maturity pay receive fair interest rate risk amount amount date rate rate value unsecured  revolving credit facility  n a april  n a  interest rate swap n a  april  unsecured  revolving credit facility  n a april  n a  unsecured  revolving credit facility  n a april  n a  term loan between la grange foundry and the missouri department finance board  n a nov

equal quarterly installments of  are due commencing on march   with a final payment of  due at final maturity 
the interest rate and foreign currency swap includes both an interest rate component and foreign currency component 
the swap requires the periodic payment by the company of principal and interest at a fixed rate in british pounds  while the company receives periodic principal payments and interest at a libor rate from the counterparty 
the us dollar notional amount of the swap amortizes in accordance with the company s  term loan see above and the british pound notional amortizes with the us dollar notional at a fixed rate of exchange throughout the swap agreement 
the interest rate portion of this swap is not considered an effective hedge against interest rate risk 
the currency portion of the swap acts as an effective hedge on a portion of the company s  british pound denominated net investment in sheffield  however  as the swap amortizes  the hedge on the net investment in sheffield becomes less effective 
denominated in british pounds 
the approximate value is the value of the local currencies translated first into british pounds  which is the functional currency of sheffield  at the june  spot rates  and then translated to us dollars at the june  spot rate 
inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on the company s operations or its prices 
year computer issues the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its hardware and software systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the identified issues 
the company believes that  with replacement or modification of its existing computer systems  updates by vendors and conversion to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
the company expects to complete implementation of computer systems that are year compliant in fiscal  although testing may continue in the first two quarters of fiscal based on its review of non information technology systems to date  the company does not anticipate the need to develop an extensive contingency plan for such systems or to incur material costs in that regard 
the company relies on a number of customers and suppliers  including banks  telecommunication providers  utilities  and other providers of goods and services 
the inability of these third parties to conduct their business for a significant period of time due to the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is currently assessing the year compliance of its significant customers and suppliers 
to date  the company has been advised by over half of its significant customers that they will be year compliant by the end of calendar there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies that interact with the company will be sufficiently year compliant 
the company s reliance on single source suppliers  however  is minimal  and the company seeks to limit sole source supply relationships 
the company  however  has entered into national service agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and freight service from single sources 
if the company does not identify or fix all year problems in critical operations  or if a major supplier or customer is unable to supply raw materials or receive the company s product  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially impacted 
year project expenditures to date total  the company expects to incur an additional million of additional costs 
the company presently anticipates that it will complete its year assessment and remediation by june  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its year implementation plan according to the anticipated schedule due to the potential lack of availability of trained personnel and their ability to identify relevant computer codes among other uncertainties 
although the company expects its internal systems to be year compliant as described above  the company intends to prepare a contingency plan that will specify what it plans to do if it or important external companies are not year compliant in a timely manner 
the company expects to prepare its contingency plan during fiscal statements above in the subsections entitled general  liquidity and capital resources  market risk and this subsection of this annual report on form k such as expects  intends  contemplating and statements regarding quarterly fluctuations  statements regarding the adequacy of funding for capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next two years and similar expressions that are not historical are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements include the company s expectations as to future performance 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements are the following the size and timing of future acquisitions  business conditions and the state of the general economy  particularly the capital goods industry  the strength of the dollar and the british pound  interest rates  the competitive environment in the casting industry and changes in laws and regulations that govern the company s business  particularly environmental regulations 
supplemental quarterly information the company s business is characterized by large unit and dollar volume customer orders 
as a result  the company has experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in its net sales and net income from quarter to quarter 
generally  the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker than the other quarters as a result of plant shutdowns for maintenance at most of the company s foundries as well as at many customers plants 
in addition  the company s operating results may be adversely affected in fiscal quarters immediately following the consummation of an acquisition while the operations of the acquired business are integrated into the operations of the company
