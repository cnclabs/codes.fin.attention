overview insite vision incorporated insite  insite vision or the company is developing genetically based tools for the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma  ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on its proprietary durasite eyedrop based drug delivery technology  and therapeutic platforms for the delivery of drugs to the retina 
the company is collaborating with academic researchers to develop new diagnostic and prognostic tools for primary congenital  juvenile and primary open angle glaucomas 
primary congenital glaucoma is an inherited eye disorder and is one of the leading causes of blindness and visual impairment affecting infants 
a gene based diagnostic kit may allow early detection of the disease before considerable irreversible damage has occurred and may improve the ability to treat it successfully 
primary open angle glaucoma usually affects people over the age of forty 
current glaucoma tests are generally unable to detect the disease before substantial damage to the optic nerve has occurred 
gene based tests may make it possible to identify patients at risk and initiate treatment before permanent optic nerve damage and vision loss occurs 
to date  the company s academic collaborators have identified genes associated with primary open angle glaucoma the most prevalent form of the disease in adults  juvenile glaucoma and primary congenital glaucoma 
a prototype diagnostic prognostic technology  isv  which is capable of identifying multiple glaucoma genetic markers from a single sample  has been developed and the company is discussing its commercialization with several potential partners 
the company s academic collaborators for its glaucoma genetics program are at ucsf and uchc 
the durasite delivery system is a patented eyedrop formulation comprising a cross linked carboxyl containing polymer which incorporates the drug to be delivered to the eye 
the formulation is instilled in the cul de sac of the eye as a small volume eyedrop 
durasite can be customized to deliver a wide variety of potential drug candidates with a broad range of molecular weights and other properties 
the durasite formulation remains in the eye for up to several hours during which time the active drug ingredient is gradually released 
durasite extends the residence time of the drug due to a combination of mucoadhesion  surface tension and viscosity 
eyedrops delivered in the durasite system contrast to conventional eyedrops which typically only last in the eye a few minutes  thus requiring delivery of a highly concentrated burst of drug and frequent administration to sustain therapeutic levels 
the increased residence time for durasite is designed to permit lower concentrations of a drug to be administered over a longer period of time  thereby minimizing the inconvenience of frequent dosing and reducing the potential related adverse side effects 
the company has also licensed a patented device for the controlled  non surgical delivery of ophthalmic drugs to the retina and other tissues in the posterior rear chamber of the eye 
the device has a needle with an adjustable collar that limits its depth of penetration and is attached to a curved neck to facilitate use 
it is inserted above the eyeball and beneath the upper eyelid by the ophthalmologist and reaches around the globe to the back of the eye 
a metering pump regulates the amount of drug to be delivered 
the combination of this device technology with polymer based drug platforms may permit long term delivery of therapeutic agents to treat retinal disease 
the company is focusing its research and development on i isv for prognosis and diagnosis of glaucoma  ii isv for the treatment of inflammation and the prevention and treatment of glaucoma  iii isv  a glaucoma treatment product which is being developed in partnership with b l  iv isv for allergic conjunctivitis  v isv for prevention of pterygium recurrence  and vi retinal drug delivery 
to date  insite vision has not received any revenues from the sale of products  although it has received a small amount of royalties from the sale of products using the company s licensed technology 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of its product candidates 
the company has financed its research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placement of its equity securities and  to a lesser extent  from collaborative agreements 
in november  insite restructured its operations and reduced its staff by approximately to enable it to conserve its financial resources 
self funded product development was reduced substantially and the company discontinued plans to establish its own sales and marketing organization 
the company is attempting  through corporate partnering and other potential business opportunities  to recognize the value of its late stage product candidates and its drug delivery technology 
in may  insite entered into an agreement with ciba vision whereby ciba vision received royalty bearing  co exclusive us marketing rights to insite s topresite product candidate for ocular inflammation infection 
ciba vision assumed all subsequent product development  clinical and regulatory responsibility for topresite 
in addition  ciba vision received royalty bearing  co exclusive us marketing rights to insite vision s isv product candidate for certain non glaucoma related indications 
in july  the company entered into agreements with b l pursuant to which i b l agreed to manufacture insite product candidates at b l s facility in tampa  florida using equipment owned by insite  b l and insite agreed to share the cost of certain leasehold improvements in connection with the installation and operation of the equipment  ii b l received  for a license fee of  an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license to manufacture and market pilasite  iii b l and insite agreed to collaborate to develop and sell a new durasite based eyedrop formulation  and iv b l made a million equity investment in the company 
as a result of these agreements  the company elected to vacate its co tenancy of a manufacturing clean room at another manufacturer s plant and in june wrote off the amounts it had previously capitalized related to that facility 
this one time write off resulted in a non cash charge to the company s results of operations of million which is reported as a loss on vacated facility in the accompanying financial statements 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
there can be no assurance that insite vision will ever achieve either significant revenues from product sales or profitable operations 
results of operations the company had total revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease from to was attributable to the license fee received from b l in the company earned royalty income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from sales of aquasite by ciba vision 
to date  the company has not relied on royalty revenues to fund its activities  nor has it received revenues from the sale of products 
research and development expenses increased in to million from million in and decreased in from million in the increase in was primarily due to expenditures related to the development of isv  isv and the acquisition of the retinal drug delivery device from the university of rochester 
the decrease from to was primarily due to reduced personnel costs resulting from the restructuring described above and lower expenditures for human clinical studies of the company s product candidates 
the company presently anticipates that research and development expenses will be higher in than in general and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in and declined in from million in the increase in was primarily due to the cost of replacing outside contractors with employees in the area of accounting and finance 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the decision  announced in november  that the company would not establish its own sales and marketing organization  and staff reductions in its administration and manufacturing areas 
net interest and other income was   and  in  and  respectively 
these fluctuations are due principally to changes in average cash balances 
interest earned in the future will be dependent on the company s funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
interest expense related to notes payable which were paid off during the first quarter of the company incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources through  insite vision financed its operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock totaling approximately million and an october public offering of common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
after  the company financed its operations primarily through a january private placement of common stock and warrants resulting in net proceeds of approximately million and an april public offering which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in accordance with a july agreement between the company and b l  the company received a total of million from the sale of common stock in august and in september  the company completed a million private placement of  shares of redeemable convertible series a preferred stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
it is the company s policy to invest these funds in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
for the years ended december   and  cash used for operating activities and additions to capital equipment was million  million and million  respectively 
of those amounts    and million were for additions to laboratory and other property and equipment in  and  respectively 
in  of the additional expenditures related to the company s portion of improvements at b l s facilities in tampa  florida 
the timing of future expenditures will depend on the timing of additional product development 
during the company wrote off its fully depreciated assets 
this resulted in a decrease in both property and equipment and accumulated depreciation of million  with no change in net fixed assets 
the company s future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs and preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in the company s existing collaborative and licensing relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative arrangements  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
the company anticipates no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on the company s good environmental compliance record to date  and its current compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses and cash requirements through insite vision might require substantial additional funds prior to reaching profitability and the company may seek private or public equity investments  future collaborative agreements  and possibly research funding to meet such needs 
even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash  it may seek access to the private or public equity markets if and when it believes conditions are favorable 
there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the company to finance its operations on acceptable terms  or at all 
year based on a preliminary assessment  the company believes that its year issues with respect to its own operations do not pose a significant business risk 
the company has not yet initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and research partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted timely and would not have an adverse effect on the company
