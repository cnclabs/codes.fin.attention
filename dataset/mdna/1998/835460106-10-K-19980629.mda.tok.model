sonic medianet allows users to share digital audio and other multimedia data types efficiently among multiple workers in a facility 
sonic medianet consists of specialized network adapter plug in cards installed in the nubus or pci bus of an apple macintosh computer 
sonic medianet combines fddi or cddi fiber based or copper based technology with a special file system running on scsi disks attached directly to the network cards 
this file system  called the media optimized file system  addresses the needs of multimedia applications 
in addition to its use in digital audio applications  sonic medianet has uses in other areas of the computer industry whenever work groups wish to collaborate on applications which require high  sustained rates of data transfer  a high degree of compatibility with conventional computing systems and some degree of guaranteed bandwidth 
in the last quarter of fiscal  the company became aware of competitive announcements which would significantly reduce demand for sonic medianet in the prepress industry

there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing such a product line  or that  if successfully developed  such a second generation product line will be attractive to customers when compared to other network product offerings

customers generally order on an as needed basis  and the company normally ships products within one week after receipt of an order

the management of the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash and investment requirements through at least fiscal as of march   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and working capital of  impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could potentially result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in other similar normal business activities 
the company has ensured that its software is already year compliant  as such this issue is not expected to have a material effect on the operations of the company 
nevertheless  the company cannot predict the effect of the year problem on the vendors  customers and other entities with which the company transacts business  or with whose products the company s products interact and there can be no assurance that the effect of the year issue on such entities will not adversely effect the company s operations 
the company believes that all current versions of its product lines are year compliant
