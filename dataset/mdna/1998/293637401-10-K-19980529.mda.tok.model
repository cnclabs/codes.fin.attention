item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of cabletron s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements relating to  among other things  estimates of economic and industry conditions  sales trends  expense levels and capital expenditures 
actual results may vary from those contained in such forward looking statements 
see business environment and risk factors below 
results of operations this table sets forth cabletron s net sales  cost of sales  expenses by category  income loss from operations  interest income  income loss before income taxes and net income loss expressed as percentages of net sales  for the fiscal years ended february  and and february  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative special charges income loss from operations interest income income loss before income taxes 
net income loss acquisitions during fiscal the company acquired the network products business npb from digital equipment corporation in february the npb now known as the digital network products group  a cabletron systems  inc company the dnpg develops and supplies a wide range of data networking hardware and software  including lan and wan products 
the dnpg products span a wide range of networking technologies  including ethernet  fast ethernet  fddi and atm switching technologies 
during fiscal the company augmented its product line by acquiring zeitnet inc  a manufacturer of atm products  in july  network express  inc  a manufacturer of remote access equipment  in august  netlink  inc  a manufacturer of frame relay products  in december  and the oasys group  inc  a software developer  in february during fiscal the company acquired the enterprise networks business unit enbu from standard microsystems corporation in january the acquisition added a line of fast ethernet products  as well as switching products for token ring  ethernet and fddi 
revenues net sales in fiscal decreased by to  million from  million in fiscal the slight decrease in fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue was largely a result of a decrease in sales of the company s shared media products comprised primarily of the mmac 
sales of the company s shared media products decreased to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal the decline in revenue of shared media products was a result of both declining unit shipments and lower prices per product 
the company expects the decrease in sales of its shared media products to continue in fiscal as customers continue the migration from shared media products to switched products 
the decrease in sales of shared media products was offset somewhat by an increase in sales of the company s switched products comprised primarily of the smartswitch  and products 
sales of switched products increased to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal the increase in revenue of switched products was a result of increasing unit sales 
prices per product decreased slightly for switched products during fiscal  but the increase in unit shipments offset this slight price decline 
sales of diagnostic test instruments  installation and maintenance services  and other products were million or of total revenues in fiscal  compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal as part of the company s acquisition of the dnpg  the company agreed to appoint digital as the service provider for cabletron products in certain smaller countries 
this appointment may have the effect of limiting the growth of cabletron s own service and support organization 
the company acquired the dnpg on february  and thus the division contributed to the company s fiscal revenues for less than one month 
the company expects the dnpg to contribute materially towards revenues in fiscal the increase in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales of the smartswitch product lines 
sales of switched products increased to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal this offset the decreased sales of shared media products 
sales of the company s shared media products decreased to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal finally  increased sales of service and support products and services as discussed above contributed to the increase in overall revenue from fiscal compared to fiscal net sales outside the united states in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal in addition to its direct international sales force  the company sells its products through several international distributors 
the increase in international revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects the company s focus on expansion in growth areas  such as latin america 
this increase was offset by weaker economic conditions in the asia pacific region 
the increase in international revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the expansion and growth of the latin american markets 
the company s international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the periods presented 
costs  expenses and interest income cost of sales was million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is primarily to i presessures on the company s products  especially in foreign markets which traditonally carried a higher margin  which resulted in a lower selling price per product and ii effects from inventory write offs  which increase the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
the company was able to maintain its gross margins in fiscal and by introducing and selling products with improved functionality  further developing its service maintenance program and improving purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies 
research and development r d expenses in fiscal increased to million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  r d expenses were million or of net sales 
the increased r d spending in fiscal reflected the company s ongoing research and development efforts  including the further development of the smartswitch family of products  spectrum management software as well as the increase in the hiring of additional software and hardware engineers and associated costs related to development of new products 
r d spending increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because net sales were lower than the company expected in fiscal the company plans to continue to increase r d spending in absolute dollars in order to develop new products on a timely basis 
the level of increase in r d spending may slow  depending on the growth in total revenues  if necessary to reduce r d spending as a percentage of net sales more towards the percentage levels in fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal increases in sg a spending resulted from expanding the sales and support workforce  establishing additional office locations domestically and internationally  the addition of administrative personnel as a result of acquisitions and increased administrative spending primarily due to anticipated increases in volume 
sg a expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal primarily as a result of lower than expected sales 
in fiscal the company had special charges of million  consisting of i in process research and development of million million net of tax in connection with the acquisition of the dnpg  ii one time acquisition related expenses of million million net of tax in connection with the acquisition of the dnpg  and iii charges relating to the company s realignment of million million net of tax 
for fiscal a million special charge was taken for the acquisitions of zeitnet  network express  netlink and the oasys group 
in fiscal a million special charge was taken for the purchase of the enbu of smc and fivemere limited purchased by network express in fiscal 
interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the slight decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates in fiscal than in fiscal realignment the company announced on december  a global initiative to better align the company s business strategy with its focus in the enterprise and service provider markets 
the realignment is intended to better position the company to provide more solutions oriented products and service  to increase its distribution of products through third party distributors and resellers  to improve its position internationally  and to aggressively develop partnership and acquisition opportunities 
the company incurred a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million million net of tax related to the realignment 
the realignment included general expense reduction through the reallocation of resources  including the elimination of certain existing projects  personnel reduction  the eilimination of duplicate facilities and the consolidation of related operations 
included in accrued liabilities at february  is million relating to severence costs associated with eliminated positions 
the company has completed most of these reductions 
the expense reductions associated with the realignment are intended to yield approximately million in total annualized savings  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal income loss loss before income taxes was million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to income before income taxes of million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal in fiscal the company had special charges of million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in income before income taxes in fiscal was due in part to the increase of million in special charges 
the increase in income before income taxes in fiscal was due in part to the million decrease in these special charges 
excluding special charges  income before income taxes was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition to the special charges  the decrease in income before income taxes in fiscal was also due to lower revenues and the higher cost of sales 
the factors affecting revenues and cost of sales are discussed above 
the tax benefit rate for fiscal was compared to a tax rate of in fiscal the decrease was because the company had a loss before income taxes 
during the year 
loss after taxes was million compared to income after taxes of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million at february  or days of sales outstanding  compared to million or days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable at february  this increase in receivables reflects timing on shipments and collections 
these trends are expected to continue for the intermediate term 
the company has historically maintained higher levels of inventory than its competitors in the networking industry in order to implement its policy of shipping most orders requiring immediate delivery within to hours 
worldwide inventories were million at february  or days of inventory  compared to million or days of inventory at the end of the preceding fiscal year 
the increase of days in inventory was the result of lower sales and the introduction of a new product line  the smartswitch family of products 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of higher accounts receivable and inventory 
in the company s acquisition of the dnpg  part of the purchase price was paid in million of product credits which digital can use through february  to purchase certain cabletron products that are ordered under the reseller agreement 
as a result of these products credits  net cash provided by operating activities will not increase at the same rate of growth as net sales through february  the use of products credits by digital will not affect the company s income statement because the company will recognize revenue as digital uses product credits 
see note notes to the consolidated financial statements included at page of this document for additional details regarding the product credits 
during fiscal capital expenditures were million  which included million in software and hardware products 
capital expenditures for fiscal of million included million for engineering computer hardware and software and million for leasehold improvements 
during fiscal  million of capital expenditures included million for building costs of which million was for the purchase of an engineering building  million for engineering computer hardware and software  million for manufacturing and related equipment and million for expanding global sales operations 
cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments decreased during fiscal to million  from million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in fiscal reflects the cash used in the acquisition of dnpg 
state and local municipal bonds and bond funds of approximately million  maturing in three years or less  were being held by the company at february  on march  the company obtained a million revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank  first national bank of chicago and several other lenders 
the facility has a term of three years but the company has the option to extend the facility for an additional two years 
as of february  the company had not drawn down any money under the facility 
in the opinion of management  internally generated funds from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to support the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both short and long term needs 
business environment and risk factors the following are cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of the company s future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings and press releases made by the company and in oral statements made by the officers of the company 
actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
therefore  no assurances can be given that the results in such forward looking statements will be achieved 
important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statements include  among others  the factors mentioned below 
competition 
the data networking industry is intensely competitive and subject to increasing consolidation 
competition in the data networking industry has increased in recent periods  and cabletron expects competition to continue to increase significantly in the future from its current competitors  as well as from potential competitors that may enter cabletron s existing or future markets 
cabletron s competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies  as well as emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets such as those addressed by cabletron 
cabletron s primary competitors in the data networking industry are cisco systems  inc  bay networks  inc and com corporation 
several large telecommunications equipment companies  including lucent technologies  inc  nokia corp 
and northern telecom ltd  have begun to compete in the data networking industry and have recently made investments in or acquired several smaller data networking companies 
companies in the data networking industry compete upon the basis of price  technology  and brand recognition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect cabletron s business  financial condition  and operating results and increase fluctuations in operating results 
competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that offer greater performance or functionality than cabletron s products 
there can be no assurance that cabletron will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products or that cabletron will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
any failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the data networking industry has grown and matured  customers purchasing decisions have been increasingly influenced by brand recognition 
if cabletron is unable to develop competitive brand recognition  cabletron s business may be adversely affected 
cabletron s current and potential competitors have pursued and are continuing to pursue a strategy of acquiring data networking companies possessing advanced networking technologies 
the acquisition of these companies allows cabletron s competitors to offer new products without the lengthy time delays associated with internal product development 
as a consequence  competitors are able to more quickly meet the demand for advanced networking capabilities  as well as for so called end to end networking solutions 
these acquisitions also permit potential competitors  such as telecommunications companies  who lack data networking products and technologies  to more quickly enter data networking markets 
the greater resources of the competitors engaged in these acquisitions may permit them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases 
there is significant competition among cabletron and its competitors for the acquisition of data networking companies possessing advanced technologies 
as a consequence of this competition  as well as other factors  the prices paid to acquire such companies is typically extremely high relative to the assets and sales of such companies 
the greater resources of cabletron s current and potential competitors will enable them to compete more effectively for the acquisition of such companies 
in addition to acquiring other companies  cabletron s competitors frequently invest in early stage data networking companies in order to secure access to advanced technologies under development by such companies  to enhance the ability to subsequently acquire such companies and to deter other competitors from obtaining such access or performing such acquisitions 
cabletron expects that competition will increase substantially as a result of the continuing industry consolidations 
in the past  cabletron has relied upon a combination of internal product development and partnerships with other networking vendors to broaden its product line to meet the demand for end to end enterprise wide solutions 
acquisitions of or investments in other data networking companies by cabletron s competitors may limit cabletron s access to commercially significant technologies  and thus its ability to offer products that meet its customers needs 
in addition to the effects of competition  cabletron s margins may also decrease as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower margin products  increased sales through lower margin reseller sales channels  increased component costs and increased expenses  including increased research and development and sales  general and administrative costs  which may be necessary in future periods to meet the demands of greater competition 
for example  as a result of the acquisition of the npb  cabletron expects a higher percentage of its sales to be made through resellers  which may have the effect of reducing cabletron s margin on those sales  as well as  to a lesser extent  cabletron s overall margins 
margins in any given period may be adversely affected by additional factors 
see business environment and risk factors fluctuations in operating results 
fluctuations in operating results 
a variety of factors may cause period to period fluctuations in the operating results of cabletron 
such factors include  but are not limited to i the rate of growth of the markets for cabletron s products  ii competitive pressures  including pricing  brand and technological competition  iii availability of components  including unique integrated circuits  iv adverse effects of delays in the establishment of industry standards  including delays or reductions in customer orders  delays in new product introductions and increased expenses associated with standards compliance  v delays by cabletron in the introduction of new or enhanced products  vi changes in product mix  vii delays or reductions in customer purchases in anticipation of the introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors and viii instability of the international markets in which cabletron sells its products 
for example  cabletron has been experiencing decreased sales for its older line of so called shared media products 
the period to period rate of decrease has been greater in certain periods than in others and has been difficult to predict 
backlog as of any particular date is not indicative of future revenue due  in part  to the possibility of order cancellations  customer requested delivery delays  shifting purchasing patterns and inventory level variability 
in particular  cabletron has been experiencing longer sales cycles for its core products as a result of the increasing dollar amount of customer orders and longer customer planning cycles 
also  in the recent past  cabletron has experienced backend loading of its quarterly sales  making the predictability of the quarterly results highly speculative 
these factors  together with increased competition  have led to an increase in sales variability and a decrease in cabletron s ability to predict aggregate sales demand for any given period 
these factors have increased the possibility that the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely affected by the failure to obtain or delays in obtaining a limited number of large customer orders  due  for example  to cancellations  delays or deferrals by customers 
cabletron plans to continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and technical support staff in anticipation of future revenue growth 
if growth in cabletron s revenues in any quarter fails to match cabletron s expense levels  its earnings and margins would be materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the three month period ended february   a shortfall in orders resulted in a substantial decline in cabletron s earnings from the fourth quarter of fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that net sales will not decrease in future quarters 
any decrease in net sales could have a material adverse affect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  cabletron may not be able to adjust expense levels to match any shortfall in revenues 
as the industry becomes more competitive and standards based  cabletron is facing greater price competition from its competitors 
if cabletron does not respond with lower production costs  pricing pressures could adversely affect future earnings 
accordingly  past results may not be indicative of future results 
there can be no assurance that the announcement or introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors  or a change in industry standards  will not cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of cabletron s existing products  which could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the market for cabletron s products is evolving 
the rate of growth of the market and the resulting demand for cabletron s recently introduced products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than anticipated  cabletron s business  financial condition or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
realignment 
cabletron has announced that it is seeking to better align its business strategy with its target markets 
the company has incurred a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million million  after tax related to the realignment 
the realignment includes general expense reductions through the elimination of duplicate facilities  consolidation of related operations  reallocation of resources  including the elimination of certain existing projects  and personnel reduction 
cabletron may encounter difficulties in achieving the expense reductions intended as a result of the realignment due to  among other factors  additional costs associated with  for example  relocations and employee severance  the need to maintain certain essential  but underutilized  facilities  and delays in implementing planned reductions 
any such difficulties in achieving expense reductions may result in a failure to realize the full amount of the annualized cost savings which is intended to be achieved through the realignment 
any such additional costs may result in charges related to cabletron s realignment in future quarters 
in addition to the realignment  cabletron has defined and is currently implementing a new management structure 
the new management structure includes the creation of certain new senior officer positions and the realignment of certain management structures 
the implementation of the new management structures  the realignment referred to above and cabletron s recent acquisitions have required the dedication of the company s existing management resources  which has resulted in a temporary disruption of cabletron s business activities 
there can be no assurance that such disruption will not continue in future quarters 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  operating results or financial condition 
over time  the loss of the personnel  facilities and other resources eliminated through the expense reductions may adversely impact cabletron s ability to generate expected revenue levels 
acquisition strategy 
cabletron has addressed the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies and businesses 
acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the npb from digital and the acquisition of yago  involve numerous risks including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which competitors have established market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies businesses is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
the combination of such companies will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings and coordination of their sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be exacerbated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the efforts required to successfully integrate acquired companies require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of cabletron 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of cabletron 
the acquisition of early stage companies  such as yago  poses risks in addition to those identified above 
such companies often have limited operating histories  limited or no prior sales  and may not yet have achieved profitability 
in addition  the technologies possessed by such companies are often unproven 
the development and marketing of products based upon such technologies may require the investment of substantial time and resources and  despite such investment  may not result in commercially saleable products or may not yield revenues sufficient to justify cabletron s investment 
further  aggressive competitors often undertake initiatives to attract customers and to recruit key employees of acquired companies through various incentives 
in addition to dnpg and yago  cabletron has stated that it will continue to explore other possible acquisitions in the future 
multiple acquisitions during a period increases the risks identified above  including in particular the difficulty of integrating the acquired businesses and the distraction of management from the day to day business activities of cabletron 
cabletron has recently acquired several product lines previously marketed by digital s npb pursuant to cabletron s acquisition of the npb 
cabletron s sales of the npb products are subject to numerous risks 
cabletron s success will be dependent upon its continued development of products that are compatible with and meet the needs of the npb s installed base of end user customers  many of whom have made a substantial investment in existing digital s npb network infrastructure 
substantially all of the npb s revenues have historically been derived from sales by digital s worldwide sales force and certain major third party resellers 
under digital  the npb had no direct sales force to end users digital s direct sales force resides in an independent business unit  and cabletron is not acquiring any portion of digital s sales force 
under the reseller and services agreement dated as of november  between cabletron and digital  digital has agreed to resell certain cabletron products  including the npb products  and has contractually committed to purchase certain minimum volumes of cabletron products for resale and internal use 
based on historical revenues of cabletron  it is expected that digital will account for substantially in excess of ten percent of cabletron s revenues for fiscal any failure by digital to purchase the committed product volumes would have a material adverse impact on cabletron s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  a substantial portion of the npb s revenues have historically been derived from sales through third party resellers 
cabletron has traditionally derived a smaller portion of its revenues from sales through resellers and  as a consequence  has less experience managing reseller relationships 
there can be no assurance that the npb s resellers will continue to purchase the npb products from cabletron or  if they do  that the volume of such purchases will not decline significantly 
the products to be sold by cabletron through digital s sales force and the npb s resellers  including the npb products and certain cabletron products  may be sold under the digital brand name and  in many cases  will be specifically adapted for use in existing digital hardware platforms 
cabletron has limited experience managing the marketing and distribution of a line of products under a brand name or for hardware platforms other than its own 
there exists no alternative market for such products 
a higher than expected rate of return from resellers  the company s failure to adequately manage the marketing and distribution of such products  or the loss of material resellers or a material decline in sales volume through the npb resellers  could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  results of operations or financial condition 
volatility of stock price 
as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of cabletron s stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating the npb  the business of yago and other companies or businesses that have been or may in the future be acquired by cabletron  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders the average dollar amount of customer orders has increased in recent periods  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of cabletron 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of cabletron s stock in any given period 
technological changes 
the market for networking products is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions  and therefore requires a high level of expenditures for research and development 
cabletron may be required to make significant expenditures to develop such new integrated product offerings 
there can be no assurance that customer demand for products integrating routing  switching  hub  network management and remote access technologies will grow at the rate expected by cabletron  that cabletron will be successful in developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or product enhancements that respond to these customer demands or to evolving industry standards and technological change  that cabletron will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  manufacture and marketing of these products especially in light of the increasing design and manufacturing complexities associated with the integration of technologies  or that its new product and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
cabletron s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if cabletron encounters delays in developing or introducing new products or product enhancements or if such product enhancements do not gain market acceptance 
in order to maintain a competitive position  cabletron must also continue to enhance its existing products and there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
in addition  the demand for traditional shared media hubs such as cabletron s basic mmac product have been experiencing declines over the last few years  and there can be no assurance that such decline will not accelerate 
a portion of future revenues will come from new products and services 
cabletron cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its revenues  earnings or stock price 
product protection and intellectual property 
cabletron s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
cabletron attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements 
cabletron believes  however  that its success will depend to a greater extent upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by cabletron in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that cabletron s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to cabletron s technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect cabletron s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
no assurance can be given that any patents issued to cabletron will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages 
although cabletron does not believe that its products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties have asserted infringement and other claims against cabletron  and there can be no assurance that such claims will not be successful or that third parties will not assert such claims against cabletron in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies incorporated in cabletron s products 
since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent issues  applications may have been filed by third parties which  if issued as patents  could relate to cabletron s products 
in addition  participants in cabletron s industry also rely upon trade secret law 
cabletron could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights which could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block cabletron s ability to license its products in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on suppliers 
cabletron s products include certain components  including application specific integrated circuits asics  that are currently available from single or limited sources  some of which require long order lead times 
in addition  certain of cabletron s products and sub assemblies are manufactured by single source third parties 
with the increasing technological sophistication of new products and the associated design and manufacturing complexities  cabletron anticipates that it may need to rely on additional single source or limited suppliers for components or manufacture of products and subassemblies 
any reduction in supply  interruption or extended delay in timely supply  variances in actual needs from forecasts for long order lead time components  or change in costs of components could affect cabletron s ability to deliver its products in a timely and cost effective manner and may adversely impact cabletron s operating results and supplier relationships 
the npb products will initially be manufactured by digital and a third party contract manufacturer  sci technologies  inc the failure of either party to continue to manufacture the npb products or to deliver the npb products in time for cabletron to meet its delivery requirements could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four digits to define year 
this could result in computers recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year  resulting in potential major system failures or miscalculations 
to address the above mentioned year issues and concerns  cabletron has established a year task force to lead and coordinate all of its global year activities 
this task force is accountable to provide the necessary leadership  tools and knowledge required by all operating units to become year compliant 
the task force is currently testing all hardware  firmware and software developed and sold by the company for year compliance in accordance with cabletron s year policy statement 
in addition  the year task force is conducting a global assessment of cabletron s essential computer systems and is making reasonable efforts to ensure that cabletron s information technology infrastructure will not be adversely affected by the turn of the century 
currently  cabletron has no reasonable estimate of the amount of out of pocket costs which may be incurred to address year issues for our products and internal infrastructure 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial position and operations if key suppliers  customers and other constituents do not become year compliant on a timely basis 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement sfas  reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
under this concept  certain revenues  expenses  gains and losses recognized during the period are included in comprehensive income  regardless of whether they are considered to be results of operations of the period 
sfas  which becomes effective for the company in its fiscal year ending february   is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the only additional item to be included in comprehensive income is the company s cumulative translation adjustment 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report selected information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this statement  becomes effective for the company in its fiscal year ending february  the company is in the process of determining the impact of sfas on its footnote disclosures 
in february  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 earnings per share  sfas 
all previously reported net income loss per share data have been restated to conform to the provisions of sfas under sfas  basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares or the period 
diluted net income loss per reflect the maximum diluted that would have resulted from the assumed exercise and share repurchased related to dilutive stock options and are computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares and all dilutive securities outstanding 
in fiscal  the company adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop which establishes guidelines for the accounting for the costs of all computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
under sop  certain payroll and related costs for company employees working on the application of development stage projects as defined in the sop for internal use computer software must be capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software 
this is substantially consistent with the company s previous treatment  and accordingly  the adoption of sop did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk management as the company s international sales grow as a percentage of total sales  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange fluctuations
