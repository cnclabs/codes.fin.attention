corning represents an important market presence in the segment s principal product lines 
price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors 
within the specialty materials segment  corning s principal products face competition from a variety of material manufacturers  some of which manufacture similar products made from materials other than glass and ceramics 
among other things  innovation  product quality  performance  and service are key competitive elements 
competition is also intense in the consumer products business 
corning competes in a broad range of products and markets with equally diverse competitors 
primary competitive influences include price  function  design  customer service  and the overall retail economies in which corning s products compete 
in certain consumer product lines  corning has a sizeable market presence 
corning strives to maintain its market position through technology and product innovation 
for the future  corning s competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development  its financial resources  and its commitment to quality 
raw materials corning s production of specialty glasses and related materials requires significant quantities of energy and batch materials

specifically  the company s principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas  propane  oil or electricity  or a combination of these energy sources 
as to resources ores  minerals  and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations  availability appears to be adequate 
corning s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations  or may eliminate certain product lines  nevertheless  corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals and raw materials 
for many products  corning has alternative glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 
patents and trademarks inventions by members of corning s research and engineering staff have been  and continue to be  important to the company s growth 
patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries

the motion was denied by the bankruptcy court in may on august   dow corning filed its first amended plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy case 
after several days of hearings in november to consider the disclosure statement pertaining to the plan  the bankruptcy court identified several potential issues with the amended plan and set february  as the date for dow corning to file further amendments 
on february  dow corning filed its second amended plan of reorganization 
on february   the bankruptcy court scheduled hearings to begin on april  to consider the new disclosure statement 
also on february   the tort claimants committee sought to schedule a hearing on a motion to modify dow corning s exclusivity to permit the tort claimants to file an alternative plan of reorganization 
the breast implant claims against dow corning s shareholders corning and the dow chemical company  which allege a variety of direct or indirect theories why they should have liability for dow corning s implant products  were in with a few exceptions transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  southern district the michigan federal court for coordinated proceedings with the similar cases against dow corning 
these transfers resulted from motions made to the michigan federal court in mid the michigan federal court granted transfer as to claims against dow corning only  and declined to order transfer of the claims against the shareholders 
the transfer motion as to the shareholders was later granted as a result of appellate rulings by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit entered in june and may as mandated by the sixth circuit  the michigan federal court entered the transfer order on may  to transfer to it those breast implant cases against the shareholders pending in state courts around the country or in federal court 
as the single exception to date  the michigan federal court declined to order transfer of a case against dow chemical which was already in the midst of a lengthy trial 
at the end of june  the chief justice of the united states supreme court designated and assigned judge sam c 
pointer  jr  a district judge in the northern district of alabama who has since been serving as the coordinating federal judge for all breast implant matters  to serve in the michigan federal court

dow corning also filed a motion for summary judgment that asserts that the disease claims are not supported by any admissible scientific evidence of disease causation 
dow corning has requested the michigan federal court to initiate procedures on its objection and motion for summary judgment in coordination with the expected report from the panel of scientific experts 
to date  no procedures have been set by the court and the schedule for considering the objection and the related motion remains undetermined 
the bankruptcy court and the michigan federal court have appointed a special master  francis mcgovern  to facilitate discussions between dow corning and interested creditor groups 
although dow corning believes that its second amended plan of reorganization remedies the issues raised by the bankruptcy court when considering the earlier version  it is not possible to predict the results of the april disclosure statement hearings or of the motions or objections the tort claimants or other creditors may assert

and eurokera  snc excluding the losses from dow corning and the restructuring charge  corning s net income and earnings per share from continuing operations increased and  respectively  in when compared with the increases were due to strong performance in both the communications and specialty materials segments and significant improvement in the consumer products segment 
equity earnings in  excluding dow corning  were up driven by strong performance at the international optical fiber equity companies and improvements at samsung corning company  ltd

segment sales and earnings in also reflect improvement in the information display businesses following a weak performance in sales of corning s optical fiber and optical cable businesses increased significantly in and as a result of continued strong worldwide demand for information transmission products 
domestic volume growth has been driven by regional  local and long haul telephone companies and cable television operators who are installing optical fiber to increase network capacity  reducing operating costs and adding new services 
international volume growth has been driven by china and other developing countries which are modernizing telecommunications infrastructures 
in addition  sales to developed countries have grown due to privatization of government owned networks and telecommunications industry deregulation 
sales growth in reflected price stability through most of the year  with prices declining somewhat in the fourth quarter 
earnings in this business increased significantly in both and  primarily as a result of increased sales 
as a result of the strong worldwide demand for optical fiber  corning continued to expand its manufacturing capacity 
corning increased capacity during with the completion of the approximately million expansion of its optical fiber production facility in wilmington  north carolina 
to further participate in the expected growth of this market  corning has begun construction on a new several hundred million dollar optical fiber production facility in concord  north carolina 
construction is expected to be completed in sales in corning s telecommunications hardware and equipment business increased substantially in and due to volume gains driven by overall market growth for fiber optic and copper communications product accessories 
earnings in and increased modestly as the volume gains were somewhat offset by costs associated with plant consolidation efforts 
sales in the developing photonic technologies business grew significantly in and driven by increased sales of fibergain modules and other products which amplify  split  modify and manage transmissions in high speed optical telecommunications systems 
sales in also increased due to the second quarter acquisition of optical corporation of america  a worldwide supplier of opto electronic components and systems 
earnings in the photonic technologies business in were lower than levels as the increase in sales was more than offset by heavy development spending for new products and increased manufacturing and operating expenses necessary to support this growing business 
earnings increased significantly in due to the sales growth 
to increase capacity in response to growing demand  corning substantially completed construction of a million production facility near corning  new york  during sales and earnings of this business were not significant prior to sales and earnings in the conventional video components business increased in as sales volume continued to reflect a shift in customer demand toward larger screen televisions and corning s production capacity for these products increased 
in  corning completed the second phase of a three phase  million expansion of its state college  pennsylvania  television glass plant  which will substantially improve corning s capability to make larger size video components 
earnings increased significantly in over levels  which were impacted by costs associated with glass furnace repairs and expansion related activities 
sales were down slightly in when compared to  as the activity related to the state college capacity expansion and glass furnace repairs limited the effective capacity during the year 
likewise  earnings in decreased significantly due to the glass furnace repairs and the costs of expanding the state college facility

earnings increased in due to the sales increase and manufacturing cost efficiencies when compared to sales decreased slightly in when compared with as a result of general market softness 
during  corning completed the second phase of an approximate million expansion of its projection video components manufacturing facility in cincinnati  ohio 
the lower volume  coupled with expansion related manufacturing inefficiencies  resulted in significantly decreased earnings in sales in the advanced display products business  which produces liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays  were even with as substantial volume gains were offset by price declines and the impact of unfavorable exchange rates 
in addition  sales of glass into korea declined as samsung corning precision glass company  ltd  an equity affiliate  began production in that market 
sales increased in reflecting strong volume growth offset partially by price declines 
the business incurred a loss in both and principally as a result of heavy spending on new product development which more than offset improved operating performance

samsung corning s sales increased in and sales in both years benefited from samsung corning s global expansion which included the acquisition and building of manufacturing and sales facilities in germany and malaysia 
sales in were also favorably impacted by additional volume received while a competitor incurred an employee strike  but adversely impacted by price declines driven by a competitive asian market 
earnings increased in as the increased volume and cost reductions more than offset the impact of price declines 
earnings increased in as volume gains were partially offset by the impact of the start up of new capacity in both germany and malaysia during the year
