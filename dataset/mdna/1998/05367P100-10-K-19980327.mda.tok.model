gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the acquisition of components  the assembly  test  and distribution of finished products  provisions for inventory obsolescence  warehousing  shipping  and post sales customer support costs 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs and sales of aftermarket hardware products 
gross margin increased to in compared to in and in the increase during was primarily due to lower material costs and manufacturing efficiencies  reduced discounts and other sales promotion programs  and a favorable product mix 
the decrease in compared to largely reflects the effects of upgrading media composer systems for use on pci based computers and an increase in manufacturing overhead associated with higher facility  information system and customer support costs allocated to costs of revenues 
in addition  the company s decrease in gross margin in resulted from increased provisions for inventory obsolescence  the fourth quarter non cash charge of million related principally to spare parts which were no longer required to support the company s business  and the recognition of approximately million of revenue from the sale of certain server based broadcast products at a relatively low gross margin 
the company currently expects gross margins during to be slightly above levels 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to and increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increased expenditures in were primarily due to provisions resulting from the company s profit sharing plan and additions to the company s engineering staffs for the continued development of new and existing products

marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to and increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the decrease in sales and marketing in was primarily due to the effect of the restructuring of the company s sales and marketing operations during the first quarter of the company has shifted its primary distribution emphasis from a direct sales force to indirect sales channels  which reduced certain costs including direct sales compensation and office overhead expenses in the reduction in these costs was partially offset by the allocation in of product marketing costs to sales and marketing rather than to research and development 
the increase in sales and marketing in compared to was primarily due to expansion of the company s field sales operations and the opening of field sales offices domestically and internationally during the latter part of marketing and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  and from in this decrease in was primarily due to the increase in net revenues in compared to general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million in the year ended december  compared to and increased by million in the year ended december  compared to this increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to was primarily due to provisions resulting from the company s profit sharing plan

in june  statement of financial accounting standards no

in october  statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  was issued which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt the guidelines of sop as of january  and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial results 
certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following the company s gross margin has fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  based on factors such as the mix of products sold  cost and the proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product and platform upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  the costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with errors or flaws  provisions for inventory obsolescence  allocations of overhead costs to manufacturing and customer support costs to cost of goods  sales of third party computer hardware to its distributors  and competitive pressure on selling prices of products 
the company s systems and software products typically have higher gross margins than storage devices and product upgrades 
gross profit varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
the company  from time to time  adds functionality and features to its systems 
if such additions are accomplished through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and if the company does not increase the price of such systems to offset these increased costs  the company s gross margins on such systems would be adversely affected 
the company has shifted an increasing proportion of its sales through indirect channels such as distributors and resellers 
the majority of the company s product sales to the broadcast industry  however  continues to be sold on a direct basis 
the company believes the overall shift to indirect channels has resulted in an increase in the number of software and circuit board kits sold through indirect channels in comparison with turnkey systems consisting of cpus  monitors  and peripheral devices  including accompanying software and circuit boards  sold by the company through its direct sales force to customers 
resellers and distributors typically purchase software and kits from the company and other turnkey components from other vendor sources in order to produce complete systems for resale 
therefore  to the extent the company increases its sales through indirect channels  its revenue per unit sale will be less than it would have been had the same sale been made directly by the company 
in the event the company is unable to increase the volume of sales in order to offset this decrease in revenue per sale or is unable to continue to reduce its costs associated with such sales  profits could be adversely affected 
in  the company shipped server based  all digital broadcast newsroom systems to a limited number of beta sites 
these systems incorporate a variety of the company s products  as well as a significant amount of hardware purchased from third parties  including computers purchased from silicon graphics  inc sgi 
because some of the technology and products in these systems were new and untested in live broadcast environments at the time that such systems were originally installed  the company provided greater than normal discounts to these initial customers 
in addition  because some of the technology and products in these systems were new and untested in live broadcast environments at the time that such systems were originally installed  the company has incurred unexpected delays and greater than expected costs in completing and supporting these initial installations to customers satisfaction 
as of december   all revenues and costs related to the initial installations have been recognized 
the company has recognized approximately million in revenues from these initial installations and approximately million of related costs 
the company had provided a reserve for estimated costs in excess of anticipated revenues 
in and  the company installed additional server based  all digital broadcast newsroom systems at other customer sites 
some of these systems have been accepted by customers  and the resulting revenues and associated costs were recognized by the company 
others of these systems have not yet been accepted by customers 
the company believes that such installations  when and if fully recognized as revenue on customer acceptance  will be profitable 
however  the company is unable to determine whether and when the systems will be accepted 
in any event  the company believes that  because of the high proportion of third party hardware  including computers and storage devices  included in such systems  the gross margins on such sales will be lower than the gross margins generally on the company s other systems 
the company s operating expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
in recent quarters more than of the company s revenues for the quarter have been recorded in the third month of the quarter 
further  in many cases  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  the company s operating results would be adversely affected and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to operate profitably 
reductions of certain operating expenses  if incurred  in the face of lower than expected revenues could involve material one time charges associated with reductions in headcount  trimming product lines  eliminating facilities and offices  and writing off certain assets 
the company has significant deferred tax assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
the deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of tax credit and operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
the company has expanded its product line to address the digital media production needs of the television broadcast news market and the emerging market for multimedia production tools  including the corporate user market 
the company has limited experience in serving these markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop such products successfully  that such products will achieve widespread customer acceptance  or that the company will be able to develop distribution and support channels to serve these markets 
a significant portion of the company s future growth will depend on customer acceptance in these and other new markets 
any failure of such products to achieve market acceptance  additional costs and expenses incurred by the company to improve market acceptance of such products and to develop new distribution and support channels  or the withdrawal from the market of such products or of the company from such new markets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has from time to time developed new products  or upgraded existing products that incorporate advances in enabling technologies 
the company believes that further advances will occur in such enabling technologies  including microprocessors  computers  operating systems  networking technologies  bus architectures  storage devices  and digital media formats 
the company may be required  based on market demand or the decision of certain suppliers  to end the manufacturing of certain products based on earlier generations of technology  to upgrade existing products or develop other products that incorporate these further advances 
in particular  the company believes that it will be necessary to develop additional products which operate using intel architecture ia based computers and the windows nt operating system 
there can be no assurance that customers will not defer purchases of existing apple based products in anticipation of the release of ia based or nt based products  that the company will be successful in developing additional ia based  nt based or other new products or that they will gain market acceptance  if developed 
any deferral by customers of purchases of existing apple based products or any failure by the company to develop such new products in a timely way or to gain market acceptance for them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s products operate primarily only on apple computers 
apple continues to suffer business and financial difficulties 
in consideration of these difficulties  there can be no assurance that customers will not delay purchases of apple based products  or purchase competitors products based on non apple computers  that apple will continue to develop and manufacture products suitable for the company s existing and future markets or that the company will be able to secure an adequate supply of apple computers  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is also dependent on a number of other suppliers as sole source vendors of certain other key components of its products and systems 
products purchased by the company from sole source vendors include computers from apple and sgi  video compression chips manufactured by c cube microsystems  a small computer systems interface scsi accelerator board from atto technology  a d digital video effects board from pinnacle systems  application specific integrated circuits asics from lucent  ami  atmel  and lsi logic  digital signal processing integrated circuit from motorola  and a fibre channel adapter card from adaptec 
the company purchases these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
the company also manufactures certain circuit boards under license from truevision  inc the company generally does not carry significant inventories of these sole source components and has no guaranteed supply arrangements 
no assurance can be given that sole source suppliers will devote the resources necessary to support the enhancement or continued availability of such components or that any such supplier will not encounter technical  operating or financial difficulties that might imperil the company s supply of such sole source components 
while the company believes that alternative sources of supply for sole source components could be developed  or systems redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  its business and results of operations would be materially affected if it were to encounter an untimely or extended interruption in its sources of supply 
the markets for digital media editing and production systems are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
the company encounters competition in the video and film editing and effects  digital news production  and professional audio markets 
many current and potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  and marketing resources than the company 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which the company could not operate profitably 
further  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those of the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in its target markets or that future competition will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar  therefore  could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
the company attempts to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on results through the use of forward exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency denominated intercompany net receivables or payable balances 
the company has generally not hedged transactions with external parties  although it periodically re evaluates its hedging practices 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings  including patent and securities litigation  an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see note k to consolidated financial statements  and item  legal proceedings 
this litigation has also been described in previously filed reports on form q and k 
the company recognizes that it must ensure that its products and operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures the year issue which can arise in time sensitive software applications which utilize a field of two digits to define the applicable year 
in such applications  a date using as the year may be recognized as the year rather than the year in general  the company expects to resolve year issues through planned replacement or upgrades 
in addition  the company expects that any costs incurred to modify its internal systems will not be material 
although management does not expect year issues to have a material impact on its business or future results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruptions of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the company will not incur significant costs to avoid such interruptions or limitations
