despite the efforts of the interim management team led by messrs 
goelman and coin  the company did not meet its stated goal of cash flow positive operating results by the end of the last accounting period of fiscal the reasons for the shortfall are several the increased one time general and administrative costs associated with the addition of the new executive management team headed by john martin and tim ryan  inadequate and unsuccessful marketing  delays in installation of coffee carts in orange county and inadequate management of certain labor costs 
messrs 
martin and ryan determined that  while the turnaround plan implemented by the interim management team had stabilized the company operationally  it was not likely to result in profitable growth in the near future 
accordingly  they initiated a business planning process that resulted in a strategic five year plan directed toward growth through franchise area development agreements combined with focused company unit growth and centralization of production facilities 
this plan also built on the interim management strategy of developing new wholesale business channels 
new management also reviewed the existing asset base and determined that one coffeehouse designated for closure would remain open and two additional coffeehouses and the denver warehouse would be closed 
charges for these closures as well as provisions for other contingencies resulted in additional operating expenses of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
the company plans to focus  in the first half of fiscal  on significant improvements in operations and customer service  to design and develop prototype optimized coffeehouses  kiosks and carts  to continue the automation and improvement of management information systems  to acquire and use modern vacuum packaging equipment  to develop a site selection model for its own use and use by franchise area developers  to test relationships with arrowhead water office coffee service and brewing water and selected suppliers for premium baked goods and develop and implement a comprehensive marketing plan 
there can be no assurances of positive year end earnings or as to when the company will be cash flow positive

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to  for the year ended january  from  for the year ended january   principally due to depreciable assets related to the addition of new coffeehouses during fiscal and the conversion costs of the acquired locations being depreciated for the full year

subsequently  on april   the company recorded an impairment provision and a restructuring charge of approximately million in connection with the closure of coffeehouses and other related expenses 
eleven of the original coffeehouses identified for closure were closed in fiscal with leases terminated in most cases 
in january the new management reviewed the progress of all retail operations and determined that one coffeehouse originally designed for closure would remain open 
at year end  most of the lease terminations provided for in the restructuring had been completed at less cost than originally anticipated 
as a result of these two factors  management determined that the remaining restructuring reserve could be reduced by  general and administrative expenses

on average these stores have been open for five years and had sales of approximately million per store for the year ended january  cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended january  increased to  from  for the year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of three factors low sales volume for the acquired stores which resulted in substantially higher rent as a percentage of sales  newly opened stores with higher initial product costs during the growth period in their early months of operation and increased costs related to lower than expected holiday specialty sales 
store operating expenses 
for the year ended january   store operating expenses  as a percentage of retail net sales  similarly increased to from for the year ended january  as in the case of cost of sales  these increases were due to increased labor and other start up costs relating to the opening of fifteen new diedrich coffeehouses in fiscal  and additional store operating expenses for the acquired stores
