none of the non cash charges are due to contractions in the core businesses of the company  and therefore are not expected to effect future liquidity or results of operations 
charges for the management reorganization and potential liabilities related to settlement of litigation will generally be paid over a period of time in excess of one year  and can  in some cases be settled with the issuance of stock instead of using cash 
the management reorganization and lay offs of other employees were not due to a contraction in the company s core businesses  but rather were cost cutting measures being implemented to improve operations 
these liabilities  depending on the extent and timing  could affect future liquidity  but are expected to be funded from on going operations

there can be no assurance that the company s currently available resources will be sufficient to allow the company to support its operations until such time  if any  as its internally generated cash flow is able to sustain the company 
as a result of the working capital ratio and other factors  the company is in default of certain covenants of certain leasing arrangements 
the leasing arrangements provide for payments from certain customers to be paid to a lockbox maintained by an independent bank 
the company has agreed to direct the payments of other customers to the lockboxes each month to provide the lessors with further security 
the excess funds are returned to the company each month following the lease payment 
in return  the lessors have agreed not to pursue their contractual rights to accelerate payments and other rights in the event of default 
there can be no assurance  however  that they will not do so in the future  if the company fails to satisfy all of its obligations under the leasing arrangements 
the company had  of cash available at december  in  the company completed a plan to repurchase equipment related to certain lease obligations 
this transaction has resulted in improved cash flow due to the elimination of the lease payments 
further  following the management reorganization  the company implemented an organization and strategic restructuring plan aimed at reducing expenses  which included a workforce reduction and focusing on immediate goals designed to generate immediate results 
the company has both short term and long term needs for cash outside of its normal operating needs 
in recent years  the company has experienced technical problems related to its playmaker r device 
further  the company has also experienced a high rate of customers discontinuing service 
a task force has been assembled to review the issue and to make recommendations to improve playmaker r performance 
based on current data  the company believes that any required changes can be affected within the next year 
the costs are estimated to be less than  and are expected to be funded through operational cash flow 
the company anticipates that the number of customers discontinuing service due to technical problems may revert to historical levels once the playmaker r performance has been improved  although no assurances can be given that a solution can be reached without undue delay or cost 
if the technical problems persist for an extended period of time  it may negatively impact the company s cash flow from operations

these payments include contractual amounts under resignation agreements and payment for unused vacation leave

the agreements were modified to extend the payment term an additional year to december  and provided for reductions of amounts to be paid in and totaling  and  respectively 
all obligations owing to former officers are expected to be funded through operations 
the modification also provides an option to the company to settle all amounts due pursuant to the in shares of common stock 
the option period commenced march  and extends to june  the number of shares of common stock to be issued will be of the number of shares determined by dividing the present value of the amount then owing using a discount rate of by the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the third business day before the notice of the exercise of the option 
should the conversion option be exercised  the company agrees to file a registration statement on behalf of the former officers to register the shares to be issued within days of providing notice of its intent to exercise its option 
the number of shares of common stock to be issued shall be of the number of shares determined by dividing the present value of the amount then owing using a discount rate of by the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the third business day before the notice of the exercise of the option 
the company has conducted an analysis of its external and internal operating systems in conjunction with the year issue 
the year issue relates to the ability of computer software programs to recognize the arrival of the year because of a common software design feature that describes the current year by only its last two digits 
the company has determined that its operations will handle year compliance correctly assuming that the operating systems upon which they run have been updated to comply 
many of the company s programs obtain date information directly from the computer s operating systems 
thus the current versions of the company s programs are as compliant as the operating systems upon which they run 
microsoft corporation  which provides the basic operating system on which the company operates  has stated that their products will continue to operate properly into the twenty first century 
although the company does not believe there are any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems 
the company has several lawsuits pending 
in early  the company completed one settlement by establishing a settlement fund consisting of  in cash and  warrants to purchase the common stock of the company and received court approval to settle a second for  in cash and either cash or stock valued at  these settlements minimize the amount of cash used and provide for possible future inflow of cash if the warrants are exercised 
in january  the board of directors concluded that the interests of the company s shareholders are best served by concentrating company resources and efforts on its two core businesses  the ntn network and online internet services 
accordingly  the board resolved either to sell or cease the operations of its two subsidiaries  learnstar and iwn 
in march  the company entered into a letter of intent loi to sell of its interest in learnstar to newstar learning systems newstar  a company in which sally a 
zoll  president of learnstar  is a shareholder 
under the loi  newstar would pay  for of the common stock of learnstar and the company would retain the learnstar accounts receivable of approximately  as of february  pending a closing of the transaction  which might occur as late as september   newstar would be responsible for providing operating funds to learnstar 
the company is currently negotiating a definitive agreement  however the terms of the sale have not been finalized 
there can no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that learnstar will be sold on similar terms should the proposed transaction not close 
on april   the company reached an agreement in principle with omnigon  a california corporation  to sell of the equity of iwn to omnigon on or before may  it is intended that omnigon pay  at closing for the iwn equity interest 
at omnigon s option  however  it will have the right to pay  at closing and deliver its promissory note  secured by the purchased iwn common shares  for  payable with interest in three installments over a five month term 
if omnigon elects the latter option  it will acquire of the iwn equity 
the parties are currently negotiating the terms of a definitive agreement for this transaction and no assurance can be given that the proposed transaction will be completed 
omnigon paid  in april and has agreed to pay  in may for the option to acquire iwn on the foregoing terms 
any such payment made will be non refundable and will not be applied to the purchase price of the iwn shares 
the company has agreed that iwn shall use any such payment from omnigon to pay its operating expenses prior to a closing or cancellation of the proposed transaction 
the company believes that its existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  changes in payment terms for long term contracts and the concentration of its efforts on its key business activities in the coming year will be adequate to cover its capital and other needs for in the past  the company has been able to augment its cash flow from operations by periodic sales of common stock and other equity instruments  upon exercise of warrants and options  by leasing transactions for equipment in use at subscriber locations  and by licensing its technology to foreign licensees 
the company is exploring alternative capital financing possibilities which may include i licensing and related royalties of the company s technology and products  ii borrowing arrangements under fixed and revolving credit agreements  or iii sale of additional equity securities 
the company may negotiate for additional lease and debt financing and additional foreign licensing  however  the extent to which any of the foregoing may be accomplished  if at all  cannot be predicted at this time 
the company has certain lawsuits pending as previously described in legal proceedings 
the company intends to vigorously defend against claimants allegations  but to avoid the expense and disruption of protracted litigation has settled certain cases and may continue to attempt to settle others 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in settling or defending such actions or that any or all actions would be decided in favor of the company or that the continued cost of defending and prosecuting these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
marketing and expansion plan the company s plan to reach profitability includes the following elements i reorganizing and expanding the sales staff  ii increasing advertising sales  iii reducing operating expenses and streamlining its operations  iv and upgrading and enhancing information systems 
throughout the company s history  the principal component of its revenues has been derived from network services to locations in the hospitality industry restaurants  taverns and hotels 
management believes that this component will continue to grow in total revenues within the next year  but may decline as a percentage of the company s total revenues as other revenue streams increase at a higher rate 
to increase the number of locations  the company has taken several steps 
it reorganized its sales staff in late in order to provide for growth in the company has terminated many of the agreements with independent representatives and will utilize its own staff in the major markets for sales and marketing efforts 
in march  the company entered into an agreement with datatec systems  inc to provide installation and repair services to its ntn network customers throughout the united states 
in  the company will continue to attend national and regional hospitality industry trade shows and has maintained its budget for advertising in trade publications 
a source of growth in was from online internet services revenue 
the company will continue to provide additional programs to current customers in an effort to increase consumer revenue hours 
in addition  the company will continue to seek new outlets for its programs and also provide production services for a fee 
in  the company enhanced its graphics capabilities but failed to obtain additional advertising revenues from national advertisers 
the company has hired an independent consultant to sell commercial spots on the ntn network as well for the company s online internet programs 
management believes that another market segment with potential for long term growth is the market for interactive television services in the home 
the company expects to remain a provider of specialized programming to networks operated by other organizations  such as cable networks  computer on line systems and wireless or telephone based communication networks 
the company expects to deliver the video portion of its programming directly to cable television systems  with viewer responses processed using equipment developed by others 
in light of this  the company expects that any significant revenues from home use of the company s services will be dependent upon an expansion in the overall home viewer market for home interactive information and entertainment services 
the company maintains working relationships with major providers of home interactive information and entertainment services 
as the market for home interactive information and entertainment services expands  the company will seek to capitalize on this market 
revenues to date from in home programming have not been significant 
no assurance can be given that plans to expand into the interactive television market will be successful 
although there can be no assurance that the company will prove to be successful in implementing its marketing and expansion plan  management believes that the company s prospects have improved as a result of recent growth of its core business activities  changes in its sales and marketing programs and increased customer service programs
