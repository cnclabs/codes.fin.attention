item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general economic and political conditions  competition  and steel pricing and availability 
the company s results include the results of the company s southeastern operation southeastern  the net assets of which were acquired effective june  southeastern has historically operated as a metals toll processor  and is located near atlanta  georgia 
olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross margin 
accordingly  the company s overall gross margin is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
the company performs toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by its lafayette steel and southeastern operations 
toll processing generally results in lower selling prices and gross margin dollars per ton but higher gross margin percentages than the company s historical direct sales 
during  the company invested in three joint ventures  olympic continental resources ocr  which buys  sells and trades ferrous and non ferrous metals and alternate iron products to steel mills and scrap processors  olympic laser processing olp  a company formed to process laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive industry  and trumark steel processing tsp  a company formed in december  to support the flat rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry as a minority business enterprise 
olp is constructing a new facility and initially equipping it with two laser welding lines 
production is expected to begin in the second half of start up costs for both olp and tsp are being expensed as incurred  and are expected to continue in the company guarantees portions of outstanding debt under each of the joint venture companies bank credit facilities 
the company s interest in ocr  interest in olp and interest in tsp are accounted for under the equity method 
financing costs include interest expense on debt and costs associated with the company s accounts receivable securitization program which commenced in december the financing costs 
interest rates paid by the company under its credit agreement are generally based on prime or libor plus a premium the premium determined quarterly  which varies based on the company s operating performance and financial leverage

in august  the company completed a follow on stock offering of million shares of common stock the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering  which totaled million  were used to repay outstanding bank debt 
the company sells certain products internationally  primarily in mexico and puerto rico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
these sales historically involve the company s direct representation of steel producers and may be covered by letters of credit or trade receivable insurance 
typically  international sales are more transactional in nature with lower gross margins than domestic sales 
domestic steel producers generally supply domestic customers before meeting foreign demand  particularly during periods of supply constraints 
as a result  domestic and international sales tend to be countercyclical 
because the company conducts its operations generally on the basis of short term orders  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future performance
