tax position  future aircraft sales purchases in the general partner announced a proposal to mitigate the adverse financial impact of changes in tax law which would have affected the partnership in the proposal authorized the general partner to restrict transferability of units  but provided that the general partner could take other actions which are in the best interests of the unitholders in the event of a change in tax law 
the proposal also authorized the general partner to decide not to make new aircraft investments  to sell aircraft when attractive opportunities arise  to distribute the proceeds and to liquidate the partnership when all assets are sold 
the proposal was approved by unitholders in august in august and october federal and california tax laws  respectively  were amended to provide that publicly traded partnerships could elect to continue to be publicly traded and retain their partnership tax status if they pay a federal tax of and state tax of on their annual gross income beginning in january after consideration of a number of factors  including the recent tax law changes and the benefits of liquidity  the board of directors of the general partner unanimously concluded that it is in the best interest of the unitholders for the partnership to remain a publicly traded partnership at this time 
accordingly  in january the partnership made an election to pay an annual tax at the partnership level of on its gross income beginning in which would reduce the partnership s cash flow 
as previously reported to unitholders  the general partner will consider whether it is in the best interest of the limited partners to cease making new aircraft investments as opportunities arise  in light of market conditions and the partnership s competitive position 
based on its investment experience and its knowledge of the market  the general partner believes that attractive investment opportunities like those made by the partnership in the past probably will not be available 
in the event that aircraft are sold and appropriate alternative investments are not available  the partnership would distribute sales proceeds to unitholders after repaying debt and establishing appropriate reserves  and this would result in a further reduction of the partnership s portfolio
