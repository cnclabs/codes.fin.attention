under fas  the liability method is used to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company has established a valuation allowance to the full extent of its net deferred tax assets because it is not more likely than not that a benefit can be realized in the future due to the company s recurring operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments decreased to  as of december  from  as of december   due primarily to the company s expansion of its workforce  acquisitions and increased product development costs

financing activities provided  in  primarily due to proceeds received on receivable from stockholder 
to date  the company has not invested in derivative securities or any other financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
management expects that  in the future  cash in excess of current requirements will be invested in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the company believes its current cash balances and cash flow from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available or may be dilutive 
additional factors that might affect future results the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
although the company has experienced significant growth in revenues in recent periods  the company does not believe that this growth rate is sustainable or indicative of future operating results 
the company has never been profitable on an annual basis and currently believes that it could experience operating losses for the first half of future operating results will depend on many factors  including the growth of the data warehousing market  the length of the sales cycle  the level of product and price competition  demand for the company s products  transaction size  the company s success in expanding its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the ability of the company to support and maintain existing products  develop and market new products and control costs  the ability to recruit and retain software engineers and other key personnel  general economic conditions and other factors 
the company is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth that has placed and is expected to continue to place a strain on the company s administrative  financial and operational resources 
from january  to december   the size of the company s professional staff increased from to full time equivalent employees 
in addition  the company expanded geographically in by adding employees in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
further significant increases in the number of employees are anticipated during the company s ability to manage its staff and facilities growth effectively will require it to continue to improve its operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  and to train  motivate and manage its employees 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively and new employees are unable to achieve performance levels  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services offered by the company  particularly for software development engineers  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees 
the loss of a significant number of the company s senior management or other key research  development  sales and marketing personnel  particularly if lost to competitors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition  including its ability to attract employees 
the licensing of the company s products by its customers typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources  with the attendant delays frequently associated with customers internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures and to test and accept new technologies that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the licensing of the company s products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  that are beyond the company s control 
during and  the company began to experience longer sales cycles 
the company believes the longer sales cycles are due to increased competition and the complexity of customers operating environments 
if the longer sales cycle persists or continues to lengthen  the company s future financial performance could be adversely affected 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive  and the company may experience increasing pricing pressures from its current competitors and new market entrants 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products or in the size of an average transaction would materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition if the company were unable to increase unit sales 
see competition under item business 
revenues from licensing of the company s products and related services outside the united states increased  or from to and  or from to the company intends to continue to expand its operations in europe and into asia and latin america  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to develop international sales and support channels will be successful  and the failure of such efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  currency fluctuations and political and economic instability 
substantially all of the company s revenues to date have been attributable to licenses for prism warehouse manager replaced by prism warehouse executive  prism directory manager replaced by prism warehouse directory and related services 
the company currently expects that revenues attributable to prism warehouse executive and prism warehouse directory  including maintenance and consulting services  will continue to account for a majority of the company s total revenues in a decline in demand for or failure to achieve broad market acceptance of these products as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
a decline in license revenues from these products would also have a material adverse effect on sales of other company products 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new releases of prism warehouse executive and prism warehouse directory  including new versions incorporating the new code base 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in these or any new or enhanced products 
throughout  the company will continue to invest more in customer services  marketing and research and development  and make personnel additions to the company s sales force worldwide 
these additional expenses may adversely affect the company s operating margin in if there are no offsetting increases in revenues or reductions in other operating expenses 
year the company and its subsidiaries are taking actions to provide that their computer systems are capable of processing for the periods the year and beyond 
the costs associated with these actions are not expected to significantly affect operating cash flows 
risks associated with acquisitions the company has grown in part because of business combinations with other companies 
to date  none of the acquired products or distribution channels has accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues 
additionally  there are integration risks associated with merging two companies  including technical  financial  administrative and cultural concerns 
there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase  or that new products introduced by the company  whether developed internally or acquired  will achieve market acceptance
