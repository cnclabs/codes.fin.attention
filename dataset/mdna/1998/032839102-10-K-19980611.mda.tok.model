results of operations comparison of years ended march  and general net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of a one time charge to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif in fiscal exclusive of the after tax effects of a million one time charge to recapitalize the saif million  net income for the fiscal year ended march  would have been million 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal these ratios  for fiscal  exclusive of the saif assessment were and  respectively 
the components of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  were a decrease of million in non interest expenses including the saif assessment and an increase of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
these were offset by a decrease of million in non interest income and an increase in income taxes of million 
net interest income net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to increases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities remained the same for fiscal and at 
the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal increased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to for fiscal from for fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from for fiscal and  respectively 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the increases in the volume of interest earning assets increased net interest income in fiscal by approximately million 
offsetting this increase  slightly  was a million decrease in net interest income caused by the combination of rate and rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses provision for loan losses decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
while an increase in charge offs was experienced in the consumer loan area in fiscal  the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be good 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased slightly to million at march  from million at march  this amount totaled of loans held for investment at march   as compared to of loans held for investment at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income non interest income decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
net income from the operations of real estate investments decreased million because of lack of sales and the associated holding costs incurred with those investments 
other non interest income also decreased  for fiscal largely due to amortization of omsr s associated with increased loan servicing volume 
insurance commissions decreased slightly by  due to decreased volume in this area 
partially ofsetting these decreases were several increases in other categories 
the gain on sale of assets increased by million largely due to increased volume of loan sales during the year 
service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits 
loan servicing income increased  due to increased volume of loans serviced for others 
non interest expenses non interest expenses decreased million for fiscal compared to as a result of several factors 
the majority of the decrease was due to the one time charge of million associated with the recapitalization of the saif during fiscal federal insurance premiums decreased million in fiscal  also a result of the recapitalization of the saif during the prior fiscal year 
compensation expense decreased million for fiscal due largely to the reduction of the expense associated with the employee stock option plan esop as well as a reduction of other employee benefits 
these decreases were offset by several non interest expense increases 
data processing expense increased  over the prior fiscal year due to consulting expenses associated with computer and software upgrades 
other expenses increased  during fiscal due to increases in legal  postage and other expenses 
marketing expenses increased  due to increased promotions 
furniture and equipment increased  due to normal replacement costs 
income taxes income tax expense increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements

offsetting this increase  slightly  was a  decrease in net interest income caused by the combination of rate and rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses provision for loan losses increased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  reflecting an increase in charge offs experienced in the consumer loan area in fiscal the corporation s allowance for loan losses remained the same at million  although such amount totaled of loans held for investment at march   as compared to of loans held for investment at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
other non interest income increased million for fiscal due to increased partnership earnings on partnerships in which the corporation and two of its subsidiaries have invested 
the partnerships with ownership are consolidated  with the minority interest reported in non interest expenses 
insurance commissions increased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased promotions 
net gain on sale of loans increased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in the volume of sales of loans during the year 
non interest expenses non interest expenses increased million for fiscal compared to as a result of several factors

the average balances of loans include non performing loans  interest of which is recognized on a cash basis 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the corporation s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods 
the following table shows the relative contribution of the changes in average volume and average interest rates on changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

liquidity and capital resources on an unconsolidated basis  the corporation had cash equivalents of million and securities of million at march  the corporation provided loans to its non bank subsidiary to invest in real estate held for development and sale 
principal and interest payments are a predictable source of funds  but funds from sales of real estate are unpredictable 
during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation 
the bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations relative to its ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that the corporation will not be adversely affected by these dividend limitations and that projected future dividends from the bank will be sufficient to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
in addition to dividends from the bank  the corporation also could sell capital stock or debt issues through the capital markets as alternative sources of funds  as well as obtain loans from outside banks 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank is required by the office of thrift supervision ots to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of us government and agency securities and other investments 
this requirement  which may be varied by the ots  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required percentage is currently 
at march  and  the bank s liquidity ratio was and  respectively 
operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale  offset by million disbursed for loans originated for sale 
investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and million for the net increase in loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal payments of million received on mortgage related securities  as well as million from the proceeds of maturities of investment securities 
financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million including a net increase in deposits of million  a net increase in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 
at march   the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans  commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million and million of loans sold with recourse to the corporation in the event of default by the borrower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march   amounted to million and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide blocks of funds at specified interest rates for an identified fee 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required 
at march   the bank s capital exceeded all capital requirements of the state of wisconsin and the ots as mandated by federal law and regulations on both a current and fully phased in basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition general total assets of the corporation increased million or from billion at march   to billion at march  this increase was primarily funded by net increases in deposits of million and in borrowings of million 
these funds were generally invested in loans receivable and mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity decreased million as a net result during the year of i purchases of million  ii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iii sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million mortgage backed securities and million mortgage derivative securities at march  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
since mortgage related securities are asset backed securities  they are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable total net loans including loans held for sale increased million during fiscal from billion at march   to billion at march  the activity included i originations and purchases of million  ii sales of loans held for sale of million  and iii principal repayments and other reductions of million 
the components of the increase in total loans  including loans held for sale  are summarized by type of loan as follows march  increase decrease in thousands first mortgage loans single family residential    multi family residential    commercial real estate    construction and land    total first mortgage loans    other loans second mortgage    education    commercial business and leases    credit card and other consumer loans    total other loans    gross loans receivable    less net items to loans receivable    net loans receivable    loans held for sale    non performing assets non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets decreased to million or

this loan was secured by a unit condominium project in bloomington  minnesota 
the rest of the decrease in this category was due to the resolution of commercial and commercial real estate loans involving a wood chipping plant in lodi  wisconsin 
the loans were assumed by another borrower and are currently classified as substandard 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
non performing real estate held for development and sale increased million during fiscal primarily as a result of the transfer of a property from foreclosed properties and repossessed assets which has a net carrying value of million 
this property consists of several condominium units which were related to  but not a part  of a former non accrual loan for the condominium project discussed above 
these units were purchased in july  at auction  in an effort to solidify the bank s position with regard to the original non accrual loan 
because the state of minnesota has a six month redemption period  the bank was prohibited from doing anything with the units until after january since january  the property was transferred to real estate held for development and sale and adpc is in the process of completing the units for subsequent sale 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  in fiscal primarily due to the addition of six eight unit multi family properties in madison  wisconsin with a net carrying value of  the bank has obtained receivership in order to control the properties and is pursuing foreclosure 
sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets that totaled approximately  partially offset the above additions 
allowances for loan and foreclosure losses the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  repossessed assets and loans sold with recourse are evaluated on a continuing basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and management s estimation of future potential losses 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses follows year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of year      charge offs mortgage   consumer commercial business total charge offs    recoveries mortgage  consumer commercial business total recoveries  net charge offs   provision   acquired bank s allowance allowance at end of year      net charge offs to average loans held for sale and for investment the fiscal provision for loan losses totaled  as compared to  in fiscal the provision for loan losses for fiscal years and remain at significantly lower levels compared to earlier years when the bank s charge off experience from certain portfolio segments required larger allowances 
those segments were largely multi family real estate loans secured by properties in states other than wisconsin and leases receivable 
the corporation substantially ceased extending credit in those segments since the late s 
the result of this activity was to retain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although charge offs have increased in the consumer loan area for this fiscal year  the total of non performing assets has declined and overall portfolio quality is good

the corporation conducts ongoing evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance for losses  which are based on amounts of foreclosed properties  recent appraisals  discounted cash flows or pending offers 
although management believes that the march   allowances for loan and foreclosed property losses are adequate based upon the current evaluation of loan delinquencies  non performing assets  charge off trends  economic conditions and other factors  there can be no assurance that future adjustments to the allowance will not be necessary 
management also continues to pursue all practical and legal methods of collection  repossession and disposal  and continues to adhere to high underwriting standards in the origination process  in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality 
deposits deposits increased million during fiscal to billion  of which million was in certificates of deposit million was due to increases in money market accounts  and million was due to increases in now accounts 
all of these increases were due to promotions and related growth of deposit households 
the weighted average cost of deposits increased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end borrowings fhlb advances increased million during fiscal to fund the increased loan activity 
at march   advances totaled million with an average interest rate of 
reverse repurchase agreements increased million during fiscal other loans payable decreased million resulting from the corporation and subsidiary borrowings 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity at march  was million  or of total assets  compared to million and of total assets at march  stockholders equity increased during the year as a result of i comprehensive income of million  which includes net income of and a change in net unrealized losses on available for sale securities of million  ii the repayment of esop borrowings of  iii the exercise of stock options of  iv the vesting of recognition plan shares of  and v the tax benefit from certain stock options of  these were offset by i the purchase of treasury stock of million  ii the payment of cash dividends of million and iii an esop borrowing of million 
impact of year the bank is currently in the process of addressing a potential problem that faces all users of automated systems including information systems 
many computer systems process transactions based on two digits representing the year of transaction  rather than a full four digits 
these computer systems may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  the problem could affect a wide variety of automated information systems  such as mainframe applications  personal computers  communication systems  environmental systems and other information systems 
the bank has identified areas of operations critical for the delivery of its products and services 
the majority of the bank s applications used in operations are purchased from an outside vendor 
the vendor providing the software is responsible for maintenance of the systems and modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after december  the bank s plan includes obtaining certification of compliance from third parties and testing all of the impacted applications both internally developed and third party provided 
the bank s goal is to have the plan complete and to be fully compliant by december  testing of the system will occur during contingency plans  if any are needed  will be developed during to address potential problems that are identified 
the bank s plan also includes reviewing any potential risks associated with the loan and investment portfolios due to the year issue 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that the cost to address the year issues will have a materially adverse impact on the bank s financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management the primary function of asset and liability management is to provide liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within specified maturities and or repricing dates 
interest rate risk is the imbalance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a given maturity or repricing date  and is commonly referred to as the interest rate gap the gap 
a positive gap exists when there are more assets than liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
a negative gap occurs when there are more liabilities than assets maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
the corporation s strategy for asset and liability management is to maintain an interest rate gap that minimizes the impact of interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
as part of this strategy  the corporation sells substantially all new originations of long term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  invests in adjustable rate or medium term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans  invests in medium term mortgage related securities and invests in consumer loans which generally have shorter terms to maturity and higher and or adjustable interest rates 
the corporation occasionally sells adjustable rate loans at origination to private investors 
the corporation also originates multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  which generally have adjustable or floating interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity than conventional single family residential loans 
long term  fixed rate  single family mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market are generally committed for sale at the time the interest rate is locked with the borrower 
as such  these loans involve little interest rate risk to the corporation 
although management believes that its asset liability management strategies reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s operations  material and prolonged changes in interest rates would adversely affect the corporation s operations 
the corporation s cumulative net gap position at march   for one year or less was a negative of total assets 
the calculation of a gap position requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
management believes that its assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
the following table summarizes the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position as of march  fair value thereafter total in thousands rate sensitive assets mortgage loans fixed         average interest rate mortgage loans variable        average interest rate consumer loans         average interest rate commercial business loans     average interest rate mortgage related securities         average interest rate investment securities and other interest earning assets         average interest rate total rate sensitive assets         rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts         average interest rate time deposits        average interest rate borrowings        average interest rate total rate sensitive liabilities         interest sensitivity gap        cumulative interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets balances have been reduced for i undisbursed loan proceeds  which aggregated million  and ii non accrual loans  which amounted to million

includes million of securities available for sale spread throughout the periods 
does not include million of demand accounts because they are non interest bearing 
also does not include accrued interest payable  which amounted to million
