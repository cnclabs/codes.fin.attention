item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and overview the company s revenues are affected principally by the number of hospitals using the i stat system and the rate at which i stat s disposable cartridges are used by these hospitals 
this  in turn  is highly dependent upon the willingness of hospitals to adapt their traditional blood diagnostic testing approaches to the point of care system advocated by the company 
during the company continued to focus its marketing efforts primarily on potential large scale adopters of the i stat system 
such high volume customers tend to require a longer sales cycle as the marketing focus with respect to such customers is on having these customers re engineer or replace their stat lab departments with the i stat system  as compared to other potential customers who may be using the i stat system as a supplement to their existing arrangements 
to further this strategy  in early the company expanded its policy of offering substantial price discounts to high volume users 
these volume discounts only will be provided to customers who commit to purchase  or more cartridges per year  with the highest discounts going to purchasers of  or more cartridges per year 
the company believes that this strategy will accelerate the rate of market penetration for its products and thus have a beneficial long term effect upon revenue growth 
however  the near term rate of growth in sales revenue and gross margin will be adversely impacted by both the longer sales cycle and the lower cartridge prices that such high volume customers may receive 
pursuant to a technology collaboration between the company and hewlett packard company hp  in may hp introduced a patient monitoring system the integrated analyzer which integrates all of the blood diagnostics capabilities of the i stat system 
in the long term  the company hopes to realize significant cartridge revenue growth and royalty revenues from the sale of the integrated analyzer by hp 
however  in the near term revenue growth from sales of the integrated analyzer is expected to be insignificant because of the uncertainties associated with new product introduction and because some of the initial purchasers of the integrated analyzer will be existing users of the hand held analyzer sold by the company 
results of operations the company generated revenues of approximately million  million and million in  and  including international revenues as a percentage of worldwide revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
international revenues include deferred japanese revenue which has been amortized to income at the rate of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the deferred japanese revenue was fully amortized to revenue during december  when the period of exclusivity under the company s agreements with its japanese partners expired 
the company also received a one time milestone payment of million  net  from its japanese marketing partners during the fourth quarter of for the development of the company s creatinine product 
sales to its japanese marketing partners represented approximately  and of the company s worldwide sales including deferred revenue and the milestone payment for  and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues from to was primarily due to increased shipment volume of the company s cartridges  reflecting higher cartridge consumption by existing hospital customers and the addition of new hospital customers in the us and internationally 
worldwide cartridge shipments increased to  units from  units for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from the increased cartridge shipments were partially offset by lower worldwide average selling prices per cartridge  which declined from approximately to per cartridge in the same periods 
cartridge average selling prices are expected to continue to decline as the customer mix shifts to higher volume customers qualifying for cartridge price discounts 
other elements of the increase in revenues in included the commencement of shipments to hp of components for the hp integrated analyzer  and the receipt of the creatinine milestone payment of million  net  from the company s japanese marketing partners 
the million increase in revenues from to was primarily due to increased shipment volume of the company s cartridges and analyzers  reflecting higher cartridge consumption by existing hospital customers and the addition of new hospital customers in the us and internationally 
worldwide cartridge shipments increased to  units from  units and worldwide analyzer shipments increased to  units from  units for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
other elements of the increase in revenues included recognition of an additional million of deferred revenue  due to a change in accounting estimate in  from the company s japanese marketing partners  higher average selling prices per unit of the company s analyzers and slightly higher worldwide average selling prices per unit of the company s cartridges  reflecting increases in the unit transfer prices specified in the company s contracts with its japanese partners which were partially offset by lower average selling prices per unit in the us as a result of a shift to higher volume us customers that qualified for discounted cartridge prices 
the manufacturing costs associated with product sales in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this resulted in a gross profit of million and million in and  respectively  compared with a gross loss of million in the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased shipment volume of the company s cartridges  which caused manufacturing costs including direct labor and a large component of overhead to be spread over a larger number of product units 
the additional japanese deferred revenue and milestone payment noted above also contributed to the gross margin improvement 
the company incurred research and development costs as a percentage of sales of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  consisting of costs associated with the personnel  material  equipment and facilities necessary for conducting new product development 
the company s current research and development program includes the development of tests for coagulation  which are scheduled to move into the production phase towards the end of the company also is studying the development of tests to measure enzymes  hematology parameters such as platelets and white blood cell counts and other analytes 
consequently  research and development expenditures are expected to increase significantly over the next three years 
the amount and timing of such increase will depend upon numerous factors including the level of activity at any point in time  the breadth of the company s development objectives and the success of its development programs 
the company incurred general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel  office costs  professional fees and other costs necessary to support the company s infrastructure 
the increase from to primarily reflects the company s increased need for management personnel and other services to support its growth  and legal fees and expenses associated with the defense of the nova patent infringement action 
the company incurred sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  consisting primarily of salaries  commissions  benefits  travel and other expenditures for sales representatives  product literature  market research  clinical studies and other sales infrastructure costs 
the dollar increase from year to year is attributable to increased marketing activities  and the hiring of management and other marketing personnel necessary to support the company s growth in product sales 
investment income was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the changes in investment income primarily reflect changes in the level of cash and cash equivalent balances 
the higher investment income in reflects the receipt in july of net proceeds of approximately million in connection with the issuance of series b preferred stock to hp 
interest income is expected to decline in the near future as cash and cash equivalent balances decline 
other income expense  net  in includes a charge of approximately million relating to the implementation of stockholder protection measures and a proposed offering of securities that was terminated 
net loss in decreased to approximately million or per share  from million or per share in  and from million or per share in the weighted average number of shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the weighted average number of shares primarily reflect the issuance of million shares of series b preferred stock to hp in july and the private placement of million shares of common stock in june liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  an increase of million from the december  balance of approximately million 
the increase primarily reflects net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of common stock in june  partially offset by approximately million of cash used in operating activities and equipment purchases of approximately million during the year ended december  working capital increased by approximately million from million to million during the same period  primarily reflecting the increase in cash and cash equivalents  and the reduction of deferred revenue by approximately million  reflecting the amortization of deferred japanese revenue 
the change in working capital also reflects a reduction of approximately million in inventories  that in part reflects a reduction in inventories in the fourth quarter of in connection with a manufacturing transition to smaller biosensor chips 
the company expects its existing funds to continue to decline until its revenues are sufficient to support its growth  but to be sufficient to meet its obligations and its liquidity and capital requirements for the near term 
the company regularly monitors capital raising alternatives in order to take advantage of opportunities to supplement its current working capital upon favorable terms  including joint ventures  strategic corporate partnerships or other alliances and the sale of equity and or debt securities 
the company s need  if any  to raise additional funds to meet its working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the results of its product marketing and sales activities  its new product development efforts  manufacturing efficiencies and competitive conditions 
at december   the company had available for federal income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in varying amounts through the timing and manner in which the operating loss carryforwards may be utilized in any year by the company will be limited by section of the internal revenue code 
almost all of the company s international sales are invoiced and settled in us dollars 
however  while sales to japan are invoiced in us dollars  the company s us dollar sales prices for cartridges but not equipment reflect twice yearly adjustments for changes in the japanese yen us dollar exchange rate 
cartridge revenues from japan would have been approximately million higher in if the japanese yen us dollar exchange rates in effect in were applied to sales prices 
the growth in international sales in other countries may be affected by foreign exchange movements  in that potential customers may be discouraged from placing orders for us dollar denominated products if changes in exchange rates are adverse to the customer 
the recent currency turmoil in southeast asia is unlikely to have a significant effect on current sales  as countries in that region accounted for less than of the company s worldwide revenue in a large part of the company s cartridge production and all biosensor chip production is currently conducted in canada 
all cartridge production will be conducted in canada in the latter half of after the operations consolidation discussed below 
most labor and overhead costs are incurred in canadian currency funded by us dollar transfers from the us each week  while most raw material purchases are in us dollars 
in  a canadian foreign exchange gain of approximately  is included in other income and the foreign currency translation adjustment carried in stockholders equity increased by approximately million to approximately million 
the decline in the value of the canadian dollar by approximately in  has reduced the us dollar cost of product produced in canada 
the impact of inflation on the company s business has been minimal and is expected to be minimal for the near term 
operations consolidation in january  the company decided to consolidate all its cartridge assembly operations in its manufacturing facility in ontario  canada 
in order to facilitate this move  the company will relocate its cartridge assembly operation in plainsboro  new jersey to its manufacturing facility in ontario  canada 
the relocation of cartridge assembly is anticipated to commence in may and be completed by august the company s lease for its instrument operations  engineering  customer support  selected research and development  marketing and administrative facility in princeton  new jersey  expires in september the company anticipates that it will relocate these activities to either its plainsboro  new jersey  facility after the cartridge assembly operation currently located there is relocated to ontario  canada or to another building in the general area of princeton  new jersey 
the charge to earnings in for these relocations  including severance and retention payments to affected employees  the physical move of equipment  rent and utilities on the potentially unoccupied plainsboro facility until that lease expires in february  and readdressing packaging  marketing materials and stationery  and miscellaneous costs is estimated to be approximately million  with approximately million being recorded as a charge to earnings in the first quarter of impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify some portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s system would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company has determined that it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram and test its computer software for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the cost of the year project is not expected to be material  as the required changes to internally supported software are small relative to the updates performed in the normal course of business and changes to externally supported software are covered by service contracts 
the assessment of the costs of the project and the timing of the completion of year modifications is based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains both historical financial information and forward looking statements 
the company operates in a high technology  emerging market environment that involves significant risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to vary from such forward looking statements and to vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
these risks include  among others  competition from existing manufacturers and marketers of blood analysis products who have greater resources than the company  the uncertainty of new product development initiatives  difficulties in transferring new technology to the manufacturing stage  market resistance to new products and point of care blood diagnosis  domestic and international regulatory constraints  uncertainties of international trade  pending and potential disputes concerning ownership of intellectual property  dependence upon strategic corporate partners for assistance in development of new markets and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission
