signal reconnaissance systems are composed of collection equipment and processing equipment 
collection equipment consists of sophisticated receivers that scan the radio frequency spectrum cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  and military transmissions to collect certain signals from  potentially  thousands of signals within the rf spectrum 
signal processing equipment  using sophisticated software and hardware  evaluates the characteristics of collected signals and selects signals that are likely to contain relevant information 
the company has focused its efforts  since inception  primarily on processing equipment  but the company also provides specialized collection equipment  as well as complete signal reconnaissance systems

the increased level of accounts receivable during fiscal is primarily due to greater contract activity  and in part to certain limitations and terms stipulated in certain engineering and production contracts 
the increased level of inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal is primarily due to the purchase of parts required for future production  purchases for anticipated future contract awards  as well as due to the timing of rent payments at the end of the year and for increased tax payments due to higher profits 
cash provided by increases in accrued liabilities in fiscal is primarily due to the year end timing of the issuance of payroll checks and accrued employee benefits
