item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  although consolidated net sales between years were relatively flat  there were significant swings between the various operations of abi 
the largest positive swing was increased sales volume at k m associates lp k m where shipments were made to more than additional stores for a major customer who previously had been serviced by k m at approximately of its stores 
k m currently is servicing the entire stores for this customer under a long term contractual arrangement 
at congoleum  sales decreased from lower average selling prices due to competitive pressures  loss of sales to a major retail customer who ceased operations in mid  and an inventory reduction by congoleum s largest distributor 
sales at abi s tape and canadian divisions reflect increases over last year 
other revenues decreased by million in to million from million last year 
the factors that caused the decrease included a decrease in commission income at k m  foreign exchange losses at our abi belgian operation and reduced royalty income at congoleum 
abi s foreign operations are limited and conducted in countries that historically have had stable currencies 
the strong us dollar in relation to the belgian franc in did penalize our operation in belgium by approximately 
million 
abi continues to believe that future movements of foreign currency exchange rates would not significantly affect its consolidated results of operations 
cost of product sold in increased to of net sales from last year 
this increase in cost is attributable to the results at congoleum where margins decreased as a result of higher raw material costs  a less profitable mix of products sold  and manufacturing inefficiencies experienced preparing for the overhaul of a major production line 
at both abi and k m  cost improvements were experienced  but were not sufficient to cover the cost increases at congoleum 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to of net sales compared to last year 
decreases in sales related costs and incentive compensation at congoleum more than offset increased spending for merchandising displays 
at k m  the increased sales volume experienced in had the effect of reducing the sales percentage relationship to expenses in this area 
interest expense decreased million in to million from in this decrease occurred at congoleum as a result of lower average debt outstanding and a greater amount of interest capitalized in connection with capital expenditures in the provision for income taxes declined to of pretax income in from in as a result of the lower income level at congoleum  which reduced the average effective statutory rate and lower effective state income tax rates 
net income for the year ended december  was million  up by million over last year s net income of million 
abi  congoleum and k m were all profitable in k m operated at a loss in and congoleum s contribution to net earnings was greater in basic net earnings per share was in  up from in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
sales increases were reflected at abi s tape and canadian divisions due to an improvement in the economies in the areas serviced by these operations 
sales increases at congoleum were generated due to new customers  increased demand from the manufactured housing industry and a price increase 
partially offsetting this at congoleum was a decline in purchases by a major retail customer currently operating under bankruptcy protection 
k m sales remained level with  even though included only months of k m s operations 
direct sales at k m were reduced as the company focused on the higher margin service sales  and sales were adversely affected by a higher level of credits and returns 
the slight decrease in other revenues to million in from million in is due to a small foreign exchange loss in and the receipt of a small pre acquisition profit distribution from k m in because abi s foreign operations are limited and conducted in countries that historically have had stable currencies and low inflation  abi believes movements of foreign currency exchange rates in the future would not significantly affect its results of operations 
cost of products sold in decreased to of net sales from last year 
this improvement was generated at both congoleum and abi s canadian division where margins improved due to lower raw material costs  increased sales and pricing and improved manufacturing productivity 
margin improvement also occurred at k m due to an increase in service sales and a decrease in non service sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to of net sales compared to in at both abi and congoleum  higher spending on marketing and new product development programs were the primary reason for spending increases 
at congoleum  costs associated with establishing new distribution in canada increased costs 
at k m  field service and warehouse costs relating to the high level of credits and allowances issued during the year  together with costs associated with opening new service stores  were the principal cause of cost increases in this area 
the provision for income taxes declined to of pretax income in from in as a result of lower state taxes 
net income for the year ended december  was million  up slightly from net income of million for abi and congoleum were profitable in  while k m operations continue to reflect losses  however  at a lower rate than that experienced in liquidity and capital resources at december   consolidated working capital was million  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  and the debt to equity ratio was to influencing the debt to equity ratio is million of congoleum debt which has no recourse to abi 
net cash provided by operations during was million  generated mainly from net earnings and depreciation 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be in the range of to million 
at abi  capital expenditures cover normal replacement of machinery and equipment and process improvement purposes 
at congoleum  they are proceeding with a major program to modernize and improve their plant and equipment 
because of these programs at congoleum  capital expenditures are expected to continue at this level for the next two years 
depreciation and amortization expense is forecast at million 
during  congoleum repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
congoleum also purchased million par value of its senior notes 
congoleum may repurchase an additional million par value of its senior notes pursuant to an existing authorization 
the company s board of directors may change this authorization or authorize additional purchases of the company s common stock in the future 
the company has completed an assessment of the steps it believes will be necessary for its existing and planned data processing systems to operate properly when confronted with dates beginning in the year a plan has been developed which identifies the systems affected and the steps that will be required to assure year compliance 
the company s existing plans to improve operations by replacing or upgrading systems in the ordinary course of business during and will have the additional benefit of providing year compliance in many instances 
the resources required to make the remaining systems compliant have been estimated and are being provided by a combination of existing employees and outside contractors 
the company has retained or believes it will be able to retain the necessary employees and outside resources to accomplish this  and that the cost to achieve compliance will not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  if any governmental agencies  key customers or key suppliers are unable to make the necessary computer system changes on a timely basis  such inability could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid over a period of three to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi  which are considered incidental to its business 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of clean up costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
abi records a liability for environmental remediation and asbestos related claim costs when a clean up program or claim payment becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
as assessments and clean ups progress  these liabilities are adjusted based upon progress in determining the timing and extent of remedial actions and the related costs and damages 
the extent and amounts of the liabilities can change substantially due to factors such as the nature or extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements and technological improvements 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other noncurrent assets 
abi has recorded its estimate of loss associated with the foregoing claims  however  the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined and  because of the amount and timing of any actual loss suffered by abi  could possibly be material to the results of operations or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual reporting period 
cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  equity investments in k m and the current authorizations of million to repurchase abi common stock and million to repurchase congoleum senior notes  are expected to be financed from operating activities and borrowings under existing lines of credit which at abi are presently million and at congoleum are presently million
