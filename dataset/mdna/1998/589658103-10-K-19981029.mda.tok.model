item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cover the fiscal years ended july  and on november   brunswick was merged into sti to form mmt 
at the time of the merger  brunswick held approximately of sti s outstanding common stock  which it had purchased from the estate of sti s late founder on april  as a result  sti had been treated for financial accounting purposes as a consolidated  majority owned subsidiary of brunswick from that date 
although sti was the surviving corporation of the merger as a legal matter  the merger was treated as a purchase of sti by brunswick for financial accounting purposes 
as a result  brunswick s historical financial statements became the company s financial statements  sti s assets and liabilities have been revalued to their respective fair values and the company s historical financial statements reflect the combined operations of sti and brunswick after april  subject to minority interests 
the minority interests were eliminated upon completion of the merger on november  for the reasons described above  the fiscal year and financial statements of the company contained in this form k are not comparable to the financial statements contained in reports previously filed by sti with the commission  and  due to substantial differences between the revenues and results of sti and those of brunswick  comparisons of results between periods before and after the purchase of brunswick s interest in sti are of limited utility 
therefore  management s discussion and analysis includes comparisons to prior year sti and brunswick s combined proforma operating results to enhance the utility of the information herein 
mmt s business plan is to operate as a medical device and drug delivery system company focusing on early intervention home healthcare and emergency medical technologies 
the company has three areas of business 
the injectable drug delivery systems business focuses on injectable drug delivery devices with an emphasis on commercial auto injectors 
this business also supplies customized drug delivery system design  pharmaceutical research and development  and sterile product manufacturing to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the cardiopulmonary systems business focuses on non invasive cardiac diagnostics and telemedicine 
the cardiopulmonary systems business is continuing the research and development activities for the prime ecg tm program  an lead cardiac mapping system for rapid and improved diagnostic accuracy of cardiac ischemia and is planning a us expansion of its telemedicine business 
the sti government system business focuses on the world wide market for auto injectors used for self administration of nerve agent antidotes  morphine and diazepam  and markets to the us and allied governments  as well as local governments for civil defense applications 
financial discussion mmt s net loss after taxes for the year ended july  was  per share on revenues of million compared to a fiscal net loss of million per share on revenues of million 
included in the net loss for and respectively were non recurring charges of million for the epipen product recall and million for the epiezpen product exchange program 
see note of financial statements 
further  in there was a write off of in process r d and costs associated with the merger 
the large disparity in revenues between and is a result of brunswick s prior year financial statements becoming those of the company 
only months of sti results are included in revenues 
thus  a more meaningful financial comparison of mmt results is against prior year proforma combined operating results of sti and brunswick 
all comparisons against proforma combined results exclude one time  non recurring merger related costs 
proforma combined statement of operations net sales    gross margin    of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses    research and development expenses    depreciation and amortization    product recall and exchange programs   total    operating income loss   ebitda    ebitda represents proforma operating income plus other income and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a measure of performance or financial condition under generally accepted accounting principles  but is presented to provide additional information related to debt service capability 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
the proforma combined statement of operations assumes the merger was in effect for the three years shown and excludes one time  merger related costs in totaling million and in totaling million 
the merger costs consisted of excess purchase price over the book value paid by brunswick which was allocated to in process r d amounting to million in and million in a total of million of transaction costs were paid in by sti 
in review proforma basis financial results improved over and on a proforma basis 
sales increased to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating income was million compared to million in and a loss in gross margins increased to in compared to in and in operating expenses were higher in primarily because of the charges for the epipen recall amounting to million 
margins for benefited from record sales of epipen brand products and cost reduction and fixed cost controls initiated after the merger 
these improvements resulted in operating income increasing by  compared to and million over ebitda was million in  million higher than the ebitda and approximately times the ebidta 
drug delivery business sales were million in  higher than resulting from record epipen brand sales 
sti government business sales were million  higher than as sales to the us department of defense usdod continued to grow 
cardiopulmonary sales were million in  down from million in reflecting slower sales of the cardiobeeper and the disposition of a non strategic business in late net sales were million in  million or higher than most of the increased sales resulted from record epipen brand sales 
also  the sti government business sales were higher than as the diazepam auto injector and the base maintenance prestocking programs were introduced and contributed a combined million in higher sales 
drug delivery sales were million  higher than sales of million reflecting record epipen brand sales 
cardiopulmonary sales were million  million lower than mostly from the absence of a significant one time cardiobeeper sales promotion and the disposition of a non strategic business late in gross margins were of sales in compared to in and in the increased gross margins from to resulted primarily from higher sales volume and product mix 
the higher margin percentage from to reflected increased volumes  favorable product mix and cost controls initiated after the merger 
operating costs were million in  an increase of million over most of the increased cost was from reserve provisions for the epipen recall totaling million 
additionally  administrative costs were higher due to increased marketing and investor relations activities  but were partially offset by lower research and development costs and the product exchange expense 
the combination of increasing revenues  lower costs of sales and higher operating costs resulted in operating income growing to million in from million in and a loss of  in nonoperating costs actual cost basis nonoperating expenses in were million   higher than and significantly higher than the  in the higher costs in result from increased interest cost on debt 
the higher costs over reflects a full year of interest expense million to finance the merger compared to only months in whose fiscal year ended june  
interest cost includes amortization of warrants issued to finance the debt amounting to  in   in and in additionally  the company recorded an interest charge amounting to  in its fourth quarter to reflect the revaluation of warrants issued to nomura during the refinancing of the company s debt 
the company generated other income items amounting to  in and  in mostly from sales of nonstrategic technology in and the assets of a nonstrategic business in the income tax provision was  in for alternative minimum tax compared to tax provisions of  in and  in the company continues to have significant operating loss carryforwards as explained in note to the financial statements 
extraordinary loss the company refinanced its term debt on april  and took a  after tax charge to write off unamortized debt discount associated with warrants issued in conjunction with the original debt 
line of business discussion drug delivery sales were million in  higher than due to record sales of million for the epipen family of products 
sales included epipen sales of million and additionally benefited from higher development revenue for a migraine auto injector and licensing fees notably from strategic partners  mylan laboratories and genpharm laboratories  to develop a line of generic injectable drugs 
at july   the epipen was on back order as demand from both higher sales and replacement units for the product recall was outstripping supply even though the plant was producing at near record throughput rates 
other revenues were from r d and pharmaceutical manufacturing and packaging activities 
in fiscal  the drug delivery business announced an alliance with uk based weston medical ltd 
to acquire north american rights to market and manufacture weston s pre filled  disposable needle less auto injector called intraject 
commercial revenues are projected by fiscal an alliance was signed with duoject medical systems to market and provide pre filled diluent solutions and assemble their inter vial system which allows the introduction of lyophilized drugs and diluent solutions into the same unit 
further  an alliance was signed with human genome sciences covering phase i and phase ii clinical trials with myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor for treatment of cancer patients 
in october  the company initiated a voluntary epiezpen product exchange program to replace all epiezpens sold since introduction in with epipens 
the exchange program was in response to a very small number of epiezpens less than which had self activated in the package 
while the exchange was not required by the fda  the company took the action to protect its customers and the quality reputation of the meridian name 
the company estimated the cost of the exchange program and recorded a reserve provision in fiscal amounting to million 
in may  the company announced a voluntary class product recall of its epipen covering production from june through february totaling million units 
the recall was initiated after detecting a loss of active drug epinephrine in retained samples 
the loss of epinephrine resulted from a chemical complex formed from exposure of the active drug to the needle caused by a puncture of the drug cartridge diaphragm by the needle during a production step that had been automated 
the company returned to its original production process for epipens in february the company took a million reserve provision in its fiscal third quarter and a  reserve provision in its fourth quarter 
while no assurances can be given that the reserved amounts are adequate  the total reserve provision of epiezpen voluntary product exchange and epipen product recall amounting to million are intended to cover all costs 
the reserve provisions exclude any impact from lower sales revenue and resulting lower margins because the company is reimbursing recall costs with free epipen units instead of cash reimbursement 
it is estimated that the delivery of epipen units to reimburse recall cash costs depressed fourth quarter revenues by million 
in response to the epipen recall  the company initiated an extensive review of its quality procedures 
consultants specializing in both pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing processes were engaged 
the company expects to strengthen its quality procedures as a result of this review 
sti government revenues increased by in over the prior year to million 
the increase resulted from higher sales to the usdod as well as sales to local municipalities for civil defense applications 
sales to foreign governments were lower in from reflecting the timing of orders 
in  the sti government business announced bioequivalance of its ma auto injector to the existing mark unit and is proceeding with negotiations with the dod to install production equipment for the new ma auto injector 
also significant interest is being generated to supply nerve agent antidotes auto injectors to municipalities 
at year end  meridian was responding to inquires to several major cities 
additionally  the company is in negotiation with usdod to renew its existing industrial base maintenance contract 
cardiopulmonary product revenues in were million  a decline from sales of million 
the reduction was due to lower cardiobeeper sales  and sales related to disposal of the assets of a non strategic business in a new telemedicine product  cardiopocket  was introduced in late fiscal which may enhance sales of the cardiobeeper and is experiencing favorable market acceptance 
significant activities in the cardiopulmonary business in centered mostly on development of the prime ecg 
sensitivity and specificity results continue to improve and are currently above expectations 
a ce mark is anticipated in late calendar and us clinical trials are anticipated to start during the first half of calendar the company capitalized in its fourth quarter software development totaling  liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of cash from operations in cash flow was positive despite the net loss for the year primarily because of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and the extraordinary loss on refinancing 
investing activities used million of cash in fiscal for capital additions for cost reduction projects and molds for lower cost products 
financing activities generated million primarily resulting from the refinancing of debt 
the company increased its asset based working capital credit line with ing capital to a maximum of million from million in early fiscal the amount outstanding under this working capital line at july  was million 
on april   the company completed its planned long term debt refinancing 
the company issued million of senior subordinated notes to nomura holding america inc nomura and used the proceeds to retire and pay down notes issued to finance the merger which were currently requiring amortization principal payments 
the senior subordinated notes to nomura mature on april  and bear interest at payable quarterly in arrears with principal payment deferred until maturity 
the company issued warrants to nomura to purchase  shares of mmt common stock until maturity of the notes at an exercise price of per share 
the company retired senior subordinated debt held by the sarnoff estate for million  retired subordinated debt held by em industries for million and paid down million on the senior term loan with ing capital 
after these transactions  the company eliminated quarterly principal amortization payments until june  and increased its cash borrowing availability through the working capital line by million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion about the debt refinancing the company obtained amendments to the loan agreements from its lenders to exclude the recall provision from the covenant calculations for the fourth quarter and forward  making the company in compliance with those covenants at july  subsequent to the debt refinancing and due to the epipen recall  the company revalued its warrants issued to nomura and reduced the exercise price to per share and took a charge to earnings of  in its fourth quarter of fiscal to account for the increased value of the warrants 
the company will continue to produce epipens in fiscal to replace returned units and to reimburse for cash recall costs 
while no assurances can be given  the company anticipates ample liquidity to cover the remaining recall liability but is currently negotiating with ing capital to increase its asset based working capital line by million 
an initial grant award of  was received from the industrial development board of northern ireland to assist mmt in its facility consolidation in northern ireland scheduled for the first half of calendar while no assurances can be given that all anticipated grants will be received  total expected grants for both capital and expense items associated with the facility consolidation in northern ireland will approach million over three years 
working capital at july  was million  up from million at july  the increase is primarily attributable to higher inventories million  lower current portion of long term debt million  and lower accounts payables million 
at july   accounts receivable were million  representing days sales outstanding  and inventories were million reflecting a turn over rate of times per year 
the higher inventories result from higher throughput at year end as the plant was producing record volumes of epipens to supply both replacements for the epipen recall and to cover higher sales demand 
borrowings under the working capital line were million leaving million available credit at july  total debt at fiscal year end was million or of total capitalization of million 
inflation in the view of management  the low levels of inflation in recent years and changing prices have had no significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
generally  the company is able to mitigate the effects of inflation on operating costs and expenses through price increases and productivity gains 
year the company s program the company has undertaken a program to address the year issue yk with respect to the following i the company s information technology and operating systems including its billing  accounting and financial reporting systems  ii the company s non information technology systems such as buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure systems that may contain embedded micro controller technology  iii certain systems of the company s major suppliers and material service providers insofar as such systems relate to the company s business activities with such parties  and iv the company s major distributors insofar as the year issue relates to the ability of such distributors to distribute the company s products 
as described below  the company s year program involves i an assessment of the year problems that may affect the company  ii the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase  iii the testing of such remedies and iv the preparation of contingency plans to deal with worst case scenarios 
assessment phase as part of the assessment phase of its program  the company will attempt to identify substantially all of the major components of the systems described above 
in order to determine the extent to which such systems are vulnerable to the year issue  a yk three tier matrix was applied to mmt systems 
tier one systems are mission critical and tier two systems are critical business operations 
mission critical tier can be defined as extended downtime hr 
for or more employees 
downtime for employees lasting from to hours is categorized as critical tier 
the last tier  three  is for productivity systems that are important to the ongoing improvement of the business  mmt however  could operate without these systems for a period of time days 
it was determined that all mmt systems had a completed plan and are yk compliant  per vendor certification  as of the date of this filing  with the exception of component vendors and plc s programmable logic controllers 
the following summarizes the efforts being made a 
mmt will not risk the possibility of downtime based on vendor assurances of yk compliant systems in tier and systems 
yk validation will begin internally in october and continuing through april for all tier and systems 
b 
mmt is a medium sized company with packaged software purchased from reliable vendors 
yk compliant programs are supplied by the vendor 
c 
mmt has no tier or systems which are proprietary or custom designed that need to be fixed internally 
all new systems must pass an internal yk validation for tier  and d 
all tier and systems are supported by vendor contracts or through excellent relationships with mmt 
all contracts will be maintained for tier and systems through the year e 
vendors supplying components or plc s have not submitted formal documentation to mmt concerning their yk readiness 
any vendors meeting the tier and criteria will be sent letters with yk questionnaires by december f 
programmable logic controllers plc used with machinery that produces mmt product could malfunction and stop production 
steps are being put in place to inventory and assess all mmt owned and related vendor plc s 
currently  plc s are being evaluated for their potential risk 
after the risk assessment is completed by december  upgrades will be scheduled from january to june g 
low risk tier systems have not been addressed completely  but will be addressed and formally scheduled for updates by july yk compliance may not be completed for tier by december when the above is completed  mmt will still be dependant on some suppliers  such as utility and telecommunication companies 
to address this risk  a contingency plan will be presented that recommends inventory work in process wip levels to sustain mmt and its customers with product 
remediation and testing phase based upon the results of its assessment efforts  the company will undertake remediation and testing activities which are intended to address potential year problems in computer software used by the company in its information technology and non information technology systems in an attempt to demonstrate that this software will be made substantially year compliant on a timely basis 
in this phase  the company will first evaluate a program application and  if a potential year problem is identified  will take steps to attempt to remediate the problem and individually test the application to confirm that the remediating changes are effective and have not adversely affected the functionality of that application 
after the individual applications and system components have undergone remediation and testing phases  the company will conduct integrated testing for the purpose of demonstrating functional integrated systems operation 
contingency plans the company intends to develop contingency plans to handle its most likely worst case year non compliant scenarios 
the company intends to complete its determination of worst case scenarios after it has received and analyzed responses to substantially all of the inquiries it has made of third parties 
following its analysis  the company intends to develop a timetable for completing its contingency plans by june  costs related to the year issue to date  the company s costs  which have been expensed as incurred  have amounted to  the costs to be incurred in the future are not expected to exceed  the costs and timetable in which the company plans to complete the year readiness activities are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party readiness plans and other factors 
the company can make no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from such plans 
risks related to the year issue although the company s year efforts are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on the company s business and operations  the actual effects of the issue and the success or failure of the company s efforts described above cannot be known until the year occurs 
failure by the company and its major suppliers  other material service providers and major distributors to address adequately their respective year issues in a timely manner insofar as such issues relate to the company s business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies  as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s transactions are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of approximately  for the year ended july  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
while the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its outstanding debt  the company does not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to its interest rate exposure 
total short term and long term debt outstanding at july  was million  consisting of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at this level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have decreased pre tax earnings by approximately  for the year ended july  at july   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt outstanding was estimated at million 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt
