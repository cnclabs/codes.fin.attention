item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion or per share  up 
billion or per share for the year 
this increase was due principally to appreciation in market value of investments  which under accounting convention is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded using current market quotations  which are subject to fluctuation  the net gains ultimately realized could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation  which constituted of shareholders equity at december   compared to at december  over half of the wesco group s unrealized appreciation of securities at december  was attributable to its investment in freddie mac common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
even if the market prices of the freddie mac and all other wesco group investments dropped suddenly to original cost  the group would still be clearly viable 
this can be seen by glancing at the following balance sheet totals  which result from removing all unrealized appreciation and related deferred taxes from balance sheet totals shown in the final table in item in thousands except for amounts per share december  total assets      total liabilities      total shareholders equity      per capital share wesco s management believes the group has adequate liquidity and capital resources  including the ability to borrow  to minimize the impact of a downturn in its fortunes even one as extreme and unrealistic as the worst case scenario presented above solely for illustrative purposes 
borrowings from banks and others have been available to wesco and its subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years 
in recognition of the sound financial condition of wesco and of its wes fic insurance subsidiary  wesco s million of notes due november and wes fic s claims paying ability have since been assigned standard poor corporation s highest rating  aaa 
ms property has substantially liquidated the foreclosed real estate and problem loans acquired from mutual savings in december however  ms property and wesco are contingently liable for at least of any losses that may be sustained by cenfed on collection of real estate loans sold by mutual savings to cenfed in october  which have declined in principal amount from million originally to about million at december  the managements of ms property and wesco believe any net overall loss in completing disposition of these items will not be material 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its insurance and industrial segments have potential exposure 
very large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are often established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  and thus its earnings are susceptible to bad effects from inflationary cost increases 
results of operations the following summary sets forth the contribution to consolidated net income of each of wesco s business segments  insurance and industrial  and of wesco s nonsegment activities 
in each case unusual items ie  realized gains and losses on securities and foreclosed real estate are shown separately from normal net operating income

attention is directed to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information as to operating profit before taxes 
insurance segment the normal net operating income of the insurance segment ie  wes fic and  since july  kbs represents the combination of underwriting results with dividend and interest income 
following is a summary of such data in thousands year ended december  premiums written    premiums earned    underwriting gain    dividend and interest income    income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    premiums written by wesco s insurance subsidiaries for were comprised of million attributable to kbs and million attributable to wes fic  relating principally to its participation with the berkshire insurance group in a large excess of loss super catastrophe reinsurance policy covering hurricane risk in florida for the first year of a three year period that began january  premiums written in consisted of million attributable to kbs and million attributable to wes fic  relating principally to another super catastrophe reinsurance policy covering hurricane risk in florida  also retroceded to wes fic by the berkshire insurance group 
premiums from berkshire insurance group super catastrophe reinsurance retrocessions to wes fic have declined from about million in and million in the decline has been attributed by the berkshire group s management to increased competition  it has stated repeatedly that it will not knowingly write business at inadequate rates 
earned premiums for included million attributable to kbs  the remainder were attributable to wes fic and related principally to super catastrophe reinsurance participations 
earned premiums for included million attributable to kbs  the remainder were attributable principally to wes fic s super catastrophe reinsurance participations 
premiums on super catastrophe reinsurance are not recognized as earned until the earlier of a loss occurrence or policy expiration 
insurance premiums on all other forms of insurance are recognized as earned revenues by wes fic and kbs pro rata over the term of the contracts 
the underwriting gain for included million attributable to kbs  and million attributable to wes fic  of which million was attributable to two super catastrophe reinsurance policies  and million to quota share reinsurance agreements  million of the million resulted from a downward revision of liabilities for losses and loss expenses with respect to wes fic s reinsurance of fireman s fund business 
the underwriting gain for included million contributed by kbs  the balance was earned by wes fic on expiration of several super catastrophe reinsurance policies written in the underwriting gain for was earned by wes fic principally on expiration of several one year super catastrophe reinsurance contracts 
kbs s underwriting gain in and is net of 
million and 
million amortization of goodwill  this excess of wes fic s cost over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired in mid about million is being written off over years or 
million per year 
although no super catastrophe reinsurance losses have been incurred to date  the managements of berkshire  wes fic and wesco believe that large super catastrophe reinsurance losses will inevitably occur from time to time 
while such large losses are not expected to be significant in relation to wes fic s capital base  the managements accept the prospect of increased volatility in wes fic s short term underwriting results in order to obtain what they believe will be better long term results 
one area of particular concern to the insurance industry is its exposure to claims for environmental contamination 
wes fic s management has reported that it believes wes fic has virtually no such liability 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on the assets approximately 
billion at market value added to wes fic by the merger of mutual savings on january   on capital contributed by wesco  on earnings retained and reinvested  and on float 
the income tax provision of the insurance segment has fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income in each of the periods presented in the foregoing table 
these fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
insurance losses and loss expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are based in large part upon estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for future periods 
however  wesco s insurance subsidiaries have maintained capital positions strong enough not only to absorb adverse estimation corrections but also to enable them to accept other insurance contracts 
although additional reinsurance retrocessions from berkshire subsidiaries  or acquisitions of insurance businesses like or unlike that of kbs  or other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  would be welcome  the timing and extent of any increase in insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted 
industrial segment following is a summary of the normal net operating results of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries in thousands year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services    income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    revenues of precision steel s businesses have improved in each of the past two years after having declined for several prior years 
the revenue improvement is due to increased sales volume  which its management attributes principally to changing economic conditions and competitive pressures in the industrial sector of the economy 
sales volume  in terms of pounds of steel products sold  increased percent for over the comparable figure  which  in turn  was higher than its counterpart 
revenues per pound  however  decreased in following price decreases by mills and other suppliers 
income before income taxes and normal net operating income of the industrial segment are dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating expenses and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
the improvement in the cost percentage in was attributable principally to the continuing decline in wholesale costs  begun in precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of purchasing raw materials  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
other than identified business segments set forth below is a summary of normal net operating income for items not identified with either business segment  insurance or industrial in thousands year ended december  dividend and interest income    rental income  net  from commercial real estate   interest expense    general and administrative expenses    reduction increase in allowance for losses on foreclosed real estate and other assets   other items  net income loss before income tax provision or benefit income tax benefit   normal net operating income   normal net operating income other than from identified business segments includes mainly dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries and rental income from owned commercial real estate  reduced by the costs associated with the development and liquidation of foreclosed real estate and delinquent loans formerly owned by mutual savings  including adjustments of reserves for possible losses on sales of foreclosed real estate  and interest and other corporate expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such normal nonsegment items 
normal net operating income other than from identified business segments typically fluctuates from period to period 
the improvement in the figure for resulted principally from the beneficial effect of million  after taxes  of the reversal into income of reserves for losses primarily on sales of foreclosed real estate  recorded in prior years  this compares with a nonadjustment of these reserves in and a 
million after tax increase in ms property has had success in selling various foreclosed properties at prices higher than were anticipated when the real estate market was extremely depressed 
the beneficial effect of the foregoing adjustment was somewhat offset by reductions in dividend income following conversions of installments of salomon inc preferred stock into lower yielding common stock held outside the insurance segment in the fourth quarters of and  prior to salomon s acquisition by travelers group  inc  and a decrease in net rental income from commercial real estate owned by ms property in connection with the demolition and redevelopment of a portion of its business block in pasadena 
the most significant reason for the drop in normal net operating income from to was a reduction in dividend income upon disposition of the champion international corporation preferred stock held outside the insurance segment in the second quarter of nonsegment interest expense was somewhat lower in than in  and much lower in than in  mainly due to repayment by wesco parent company of borrowings from wes fic beginning in mid insurance segment revenues decreased accordingly so that wesco s consolidated net income was not affected 
wesco s nonsegment tax benefits appear at first glance to be anomalous compared to the pre tax income 
this is caused by the inclusion in pre tax income or loss of large but declining amounts of dividend income  which is highly tax favored  all other revenues and expense items are fully taxable or deductible  and net in total to a smaller and declining pre tax loss 
management s long term goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share  with little regard to earnings recorded in any given year 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments or the realization of securities gains 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire for funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
realized gains and losses on investments have been an element of wesco s net income for a number of years 
the amounts of these gains or losses  recorded when securities are sold or when a decline in market value of an investment is considered to be other than temporary  tend to fluctuate significantly from year to year 
the varying effect upon wesco s pre tax income is evident on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
the amount of realized gain or loss has no predictive value  and variations in amount from period to period have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the existence of substantial unrealized price appreciation in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio 
wesco s shareholders equity at december  contained billion  or per share  of unrealized appreciation of investments  net of taxes about of shareholders equity 
wesco s consolidated earnings for contained securities gains  after income taxes  of million  versus after tax losses of 
million for and after tax gains of million for of the figure  only 
million was realized through the sale of securities  the balance  million  resulted from the exchange of the preferred and common shares of salomon inc owned by the wesco group for preferred and common shares of the travelers group inc travelers late in in connection with the merger of salomon inc with travelers 
although the realized gain had a material impact on wesco s reported earnings  it had a minor impact on wesco s shareholders equity inasmuch as million of the after tax gain had previously been reflected in the unrealized gain component of wesco s shareholders equity as of september   that amount was merely switched from unrealized gains to retained earnings  another component of shareholders equity 
wesco s consolidated revenues include significant amounts of tax favored dividend income from preferred and common stocks as well as substantially tax exempt interest on state and municipal bonds 
fluctuations in the proportion of these components to total consolidated pre tax income have resulted in tax provisions as percentages of pre tax income of  and in  and see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
consolidated revenues  expenses and earnings set forth in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated statement of income  are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and earnings  in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses and the possible occurrence of other unusual items 
for example  the merger of mutual savings into wes fic at the beginning of increased wes fic s insurance and reinsurance capacity and asset deployment options  enabling it to enter into the business of super catastrophe reinsurance in another example of a significant unusual item was wesco s expansion of its insurance segment operations through acquisition of kbs in mid in addition to exposure to large fluctuations due to realization of securities gains and losses or the occurrence of other unusual items  wesco s consolidated revenues  expenses and earnings from operations are expected to be much more volatile than they were prior to wes fic s entry into the super catastrophe reinsurance business 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent the foregoing types of unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
many computer systems used today may be unable to interpret data correctly after december  because they allow only two digits to indicate the year in a date 
wesco and its subsidiaries have been engaged in assessing this year issue as it relates to their businesses  including their electronic and other interactions with banks  vendors  customers and others  and developing and implementing solutions 
management currently anticipates that the project will be completed in a timely manner  and will not have a material adverse impact on the operations of wesco or its subsidiaries  or on wesco s consolidated financial results or financial condition 
however  wesco s consolidated financial results could be adversely affected if one or more of the companies in which it has material investments were materially adversely affected by the year issue
