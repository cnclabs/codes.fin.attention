internationally  the company launched its hbv test in  its cmv test in march  and its hiv test in december in addition  the company introduced its chlamydia and gonorrhea tests internationally in august other than the company s hpv tests  the company s products currently are available in the united states for research use only

the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and the company believes that they may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future with lower product revenues in the first and second fiscal quarters as compared with the third and fourth fiscal quarters  primarily attributable to the lower demand for certain women s health related medical procedures during the summer months and the december holiday season in the united states and europe 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results  as well as annual results  may fluctuate from period to period due to the degree of market acceptance of the company s products  competition  the timing of regulatory approvals and other regulatory announcements  the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to distributors  variations in the company s distribution channels  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company and its competitors  product obsolescence resulting from new product introductions and other factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
due to one or more of these factors  in one or more future quarters the company s results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of the company s common stock could be materially and adversely affected
