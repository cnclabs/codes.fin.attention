this product line accounted for of the company s net sales in fiscal and less than of net sales in fiscal and with the above core competencies  the company has the ability to provide customers with a total design and manufacturing outsourcing solution 
the company s ability to offer fully integrated solutions with value added front and back end product and process development capabilities coupled with global volume assembly capabilities provides customers with significant speed to market and product cost improvements 
manufacturing the company provides initial prototype and follow on high volume manufacturing services primarily on a turnkey basis  where the company purchases materials  and occasionally on a consignment basis  where the customer provides materials 
the level of the company s sales revenue is subject to significant shifting  based on whether orders are being filled on a turnkey or on a consignment basis 
because the company obtains firm purchase orders from its customers  the customers typically bear the inventory cost risk associated with purchases of materials by the company in connection with orders to be filled on a turnkey basis 
manufacturing information regarding the company s three primary product lines follows custom microelectronics through orbit  the company manufactures customer specific integrated circuits 
the manufacture of orbit s products is a complex process involving a number of precise steps  including wafer fabrication  dicing  assembly  burn in  packaging and final test 
semiconductor manufacturing cost per unit is primarily a function of die size since the potential number of good die per wafer increases with reduced die size  number of mask layers  and the yield of acceptable die produced on each wafer 
other contributing factors include wafer size  number of fabrication steps  equipment utilization  process complexity and cleanliness 
larger wafer sizes and smaller process geometries generally result in lower costs through higher production yields 
manufacturing continued custom microelectronics continued orbit is continually engaged in efforts to enhance its production processes to reduce its manufacturing costs and to increase capacity utilization 
orbit is completing the transition of its manufacturing and test operations from its inch  micron wafer fabrication facility to its inch  micron fabrication facility 
this new facility  with larger wafer sizes and finer geometries  is expected to result in higher yields and lower manufacturing costs  which should allow for more competitive pricing 
in addition  orbit has entered into fabless manufacturing agreements with external foundries which supply orbit with larger wafers in higher volumes and denser geometries than can be produced in its inch  micron wafer fabrication facility 
orbit performs wafer fabrication in a highly controlled  clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality limiting contaminants 
notwithstanding the highly controlled manufacturing environment  equipment does not consistently perform flawlessly and minute impurities  defects in the photomasks  or other difficulties in the process may cause a substantial percentage of the wafers to be rejected or individual circuits to be nonfunctional 
the success of orbit s manufacturing operations will largely be dependent on its ability to minimize such impurities and to maximize its yield of acceptable  high quality integrated circuits 
in this regard  orbit employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing  screening  and testing processes to ensure that its manufacturing processes and products achieve the objective quality standards that have been presented for the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
orbit s operations meet the quality standards of its customers  some of whom are governed by the requirements established by the united states food and drug administration and the department of defense 
orbit is iso certified 
interconnect technologies the company provides the electronics industry with complete printed circuit board design and layout services through dsi 
through its early involvement with product development  dsi s comprehensive review of design aspects assures that both mechanical and electrical considerations are integrated to achieve a high quality  cost effective product 
in addition  dsi assesses customer designs for manufacturability and testability and provides engineering and design automation productivity software and advanced packaging solution consulting 
by working closely with its customers  dsi gains an understanding as to the future requirements of oems 
by leveraging the knowledge obtained in the product development stage  the company believes that the time to transition from development of the prototype design to volume manufacturing is significantly shortened and this facilitates the acceleration of high quality products to market 
through multek  the company manufactures high density  complex multilayer printed circuit boards on either a quick turn  pre production or high volume production basis 
quick turn production typically requires lead times of three to seven days  and as short as hours 
this quick turn prototype service is able to provide small test quantities to the product development groups of its customers 
pre production is the manufacture of limited quantities of printed circuits during the transition period from prototype to volume production 
high volume production is characterized by longer lead times and increased emphasis on lower cost as the product transitions to full scale commercial production 
multek is one of only a few independent manufacturers that can respond to its customers demands for an accelerated transition from prototype to volume production 
the manufacture of multilayer printed circuit boards involves several steps etching the circuit image on copper clad epoxy laminate  pressing the laminates together to form a panel  drilling holes and depositing copper or other conductive material into the holes to form the inter layer electrical connections  and machining the panels to shape 
certain advanced interconnect products require additional inner critical steps  including multiple imaging processes  cavity formation  and a higher level testing of impedance  capacitance  resistivity and inductance 
multilayering  which involves the placing of multiple layers of electrical circuitry on a single printed circuit board  expands the number of circuits and components that can be contained on the interconnect product and increases the operating speed of the system by reducing the distance the electrical signal must travel 
the manufacture of complex multilayer interconnect products often requires the use of sophisticated circuit manufacturing continued interconnect technologies continued interconnections between layers called blind or buried vias and adherence to strict electrical characteristics to maintain consistent circuit transmission speeds referred to as controlled impedance 
these technologies require very tight lamination and etching tolerances 
during  multek gained a key technology with the acquisition of the printed circuit board manufacturing assets of ibm in austin  texas 
this technology  surface laminar circuit slc  is a photo generated micro via capability that was licensed as a part of the transaction 
this technology can be further developed to provide alternative packaging solutions to multek s current and future customers  as well as providing entry into the wireless markets 
through the use of specialized materials such as polyimide  teflon  teflon hybrids  and low dielectric constant substrates  multek achieves multilayer circuit counts to layers 
multek employs state of the art manufacturing processes by working closely with equipment suppliers  many of which use multek as a beta site for new technologies being introduced to the marketplace 
each multek facility is iso certified 
systems assembly through dovatron  the company produces complex printed circuit board assemblies using both surface mount smt and pin through hole pth interconnection technologies 
the assembly of printed circuit boards involves the attachment of various electronic components  such as integrated circuits  capacitors  resistors  and processors  to printed circuit boards 
smt is a method of assembling printed circuit boards whereby components are fixed directly onto the surface of the board instead of being inserted and soldered into plated holes on the board the latter method being pth 
smt offers the advantages of miniaturization and significant cost reductions 
the higher density achieved through smt also allows for shorter signal lengths  with resulting increases in signal speed potential and thermal performance 
dovatron s manufacturing processes also include the more advanced assembly process technology of ball grid array bga 
bga technology utilizes packaged semiconductor die where the electrical connection from within the package is terminated on the outer surface of the package using solder alloy in the shape of a partial sphere 
a bga package  rather than using pins for leads  mounts to the printed circuit board using the balls located on the underside of the package 
bga technology can provide higher interconnect density and improved assembly yields and reliability through its use of an array of solder balls  rather than pin leads 
in conjunction with its assembly activities  dovatron also provides computer aided testing of printed circuit boards  sub systems and systems  which contributes significantly to the company s ability to deliver high quality products on a consistent basis 
dovatron s test capabilities include management defect analysis  in circuit tests and functional tests 
in circuit tests verify that all components have been properly inserted and that the electrical circuits are complete 
functional tests determine if the board or system assembly is performing to customer specifications 
dovatron also provides environmental stress tests of the board or system assembly 
dovatron employs a multi disciplined engineering team  which provides design and manufacturing support to customers 
in addition  dovatron conducts design for manufacturability reviews and  when appropriate  recommends design changes to reduce manufacturing costs or lead times  increase manufacturing yields and the quality of the printed circuit boards or finished assemblies  and enhance the ability to automate assembly 
dovatron has expanded its services beyond printed circuit board assembly and test to include both front end services  such as engineering  materials management and fabrication  and back end services  such as system assembly  integration and distribution fulfillment 
quality remains a key focus  and seven of dovatron s global manufacturing facilities are iso certified with the remaining facility in the process of gaining certification 
marketing and customer profile the company markets its products and services through advertisements  technical articles and press releases that appear regularly in a variety of trade publications  as well as through the dissemination of company brochures  data sheets and technical information 
additionally  the company participates in various industry trade shows on a regular basis 
individual products and services are marketed to customers though direct sales personnel and independent manufacturers representatives 
the dii group s sales and marketing functions link the dii group companies to provide fully integrated custom design and manufacturing solutions to its customers 
through the integration of design and manufacturing solutions offered by the company s network of business units  the dii group companies provide customer specific products and services to reduce customer time to market and decrease total manufacturing costs 
by participating in the early stages of high velocity product development with customers in targeted  fast growing industry sectors  the company believes it can develop long term relationships with its customers  expand into new markets and enhance profitability 
the company generates international revenues through its regional manufacturing facilities in mexico  europe and southeast asia 
the company s international operations generated approximately  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for information regarding financial information by geographic area 
at any given time  certain customers may account for significant portions of the company s business 
hewlett packard accounted for of net sales in fiscal seagate technology  inc and standard microsystems corporation accounted for and of net sales in fiscal  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales in fiscal  or the company s top ten customers accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage of the company s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  especially hp  or any other top ten customer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company has few material  firm  long term commitments or volume guarantees from its customers 
in addition  customer orders can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
from time to time  some of the company s customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with the company  and other customers have reduced or delayed the volume of design and manufacturing services performed by the company 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced contracts with new business cannot be assured  and termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company seeks a well balanced customer profile across most sectors of the electronics industry in order to reduce exposure to a downturn in any particular sector 
the primary sectors within the electronics industry served by the company are data communications  office automation  computer and peripherals  telecommunications  industrial  instrumentation  and medical 
backlog although the company obtains firm purchase orders from its customers  oem customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than to days in advance 
the company does not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales since orders may be rescheduled or canceled 
suppliers the company works with customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of component shortages 
the company orders raw materials and components based on purchase orders received and accepted  and maintains minimal levels of inventory that are not identified for use in filling specific orders 
raw material and component shortages have had  and are expected to have  from time to time  short term adverse effects on the company s business  including impact due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
significant shortages of raw materials or components used by the company s operating units would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s operating units depend on a limited suppliers continued number of suppliers for many of the raw materials used in their products and services 
the interruption of supply from such suppliers could adversely affect the company s operations 
competition today s technology marketplace is more competitive than ever 
in an environment characterized by compressed product life cycles  global competition  rapid technological change  increasingly stringent quality and service expectations  and constant profit margin pressure due to unrelenting price pressure  oems have a growing need to limit asset risks  improve returns on invested capital  and most importantly  focus their resources on their own core competencies of product development and marketing 
these factors place corresponding competitive pressures on the outsourcing industry 
the company competes against numerous domestic and foreign companies 
the company also faces competition from current and prospective customers who evaluate the company s capabilities against the merits of manufacturing their products internally 
because of the company s wide range of products and services  some of the company s cem competitors are also customers of the company 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater design  engineering and manufacturing services  and financial  research and development  and marketing resources than the company 
to remain competitive  the company will be required to continue to make substantial capital outlays to develop and provide technologically advanced design  engineering and manufacturing services  maintain quality levels  offer flexible delivery schedules  deliver finished products on a reliable basis  compete favorably on the basis of price and provide access to worldwide manufacturing locations 
in addition  as the company continues to expand its operations  some of its cem competitors may decide to place orders with companies with which they are in less direct competition 
competition in the electronics outsourcing industry is based upon technology  service  design  engineering and manufacturing capability  quality  price  and the ability to deliver finished products on an expeditious and reliable basis 
in order to differentiate itself in this intensely competitive market  the company has adopted and pursues a strategy to be the fastest and most comprehensive provider of custom electronics design and manufacturing services  ranging from microelectronics design and fabrication through the final assembly of finished products for oem customers 
environmental regulation the company s operations are subject to certain federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during their manufacturing processes

this product line accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal and less than of net sales for fiscal and operating results may be affected by a number of factors including the economic conditions in the markets the company serves  price and product competition  the level of volume and the timing of orders  product mix  the amount of automation existing on specific manufacturing projects  efficiencies achieved by inventory management  fixed asset utilization  the level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  customer product delivery requirements  shortages of components or experienced labor  the integration of acquired businesses  start up costs associated with adding new geographical locations  expenditures required for research and development  and failure to introduce  or lack of market acceptance of  new processes  services  technologies and products on a timely basis 
in addition  the level of sales can greatly shift based on whether certain projects are contracted on a turnkey basis  in which the company purchases materials  versus on a consignment basis  in which materials are provided by the customer 
a majority of the company s sales are to customers in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
the factors affecting the electronics industry especially the semiconductor sector in general  or any of the company s major customers  in particular  could have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results 
the electronics industry especially the semiconductor sector has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and overcapacity 
the company seeks a well balanced customer profile across most sectors of the electronics industry in order to reduce exposure to a downturn in any particular sector 
the primary sectors within the electronics industry served by the company are office automation  mainframes and mass storage  data communications  computer and peripherals  telecommunications  industrial  instrumentation  and medical 
the company offers manufacturing capabilities in three major electronics markets of the world north america  europe and southeast asia 
the company s international operations generated approximately  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s international operations subject the company to the risks of doing business abroad  including currency fluctuations  export duties  import controls and trade barriers  restrictions on the transfer of funds  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and  in certain parts of the world  political and economic instability 
at any given time  certain customers may account for significant portions of the company s business 
hewlett packard accounted for of net sales in fiscal seagate technology  inc and standard microsystems corporation accounted for and of net sales in fiscal  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales during fiscal  or the company s top ten customers accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage of the company s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data overview continued although management believes the company has a broad diversification of customers and markets  the company has few material firm long term commitments or volume guarantees from its customers 
in addition  customer orders can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
from time to time  some of the company s customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with the company  and other customers have reduced or delayed the volume of design and manufacturing services performed by the company 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced contracts with new business cannot be assured  and termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
acquisitions the company has actively pursued acquisitions in furtherance of its strategy to be the fastest and most comprehensive provider of custom electronics design and manufacturing services  ranging from microelectronics design and fabrication through the final assembly of finished products for oem customers 
the company s acquisitions have enabled the company to provide more integrated outsourcing technology solutions with time to market and lower cost advantages 
acquisitions have also played an important part in expanding the company s presence in the global electronics marketplace 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  and products and services of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses 
such a failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the integration of certain operations following an acquisition will require the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business of the company 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for information regarding acquisitions 
foreign currency exposure the company conducts a significant amount of its business and has a number of operating facilities in countries outside of the united states 
as a result  the company may experience transaction and translation gains and losses because of currency fluctuations 
in order to minimize foreign exchange transaction risk  the company selectively hedges certain of its foreign exchange exposures through forward exchange contracts  principally relating to nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities 
the strategy of selective hedging can reduce the company s vulnerability to certain of its foreign currency exposures  and the company expects to continue this practice in the future 
to date  the company s hedging activity has been immaterial  and there were no open foreign exchange contracts as of december   december  or december  operating results fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales in fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal contract electronics manufacturing  which represented of net sales in fiscal  increased  to  from  of net sales in fiscal the sales growth is primarily attributable to significant increases in orders from both existing and new customers  such as the high volume  multi site production order for hewlett packard  which began ramping in early fiscal management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data operating results fiscal compared to fiscal continued net sales for the company s other products and services  which represented of net sales in fiscal  increased  to  from  of net sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to i increased sales to existing customers  ii an expanding customer base from the continued industry wide acceptance of its service offerings  and iii the acquisitions of design solutions  pct automation systems and the ibm austin printed circuit board fabrication facility

the company s estimated effective income tax rate differs from the us statutory rate due to domestic income tax credits  lower effective income tax rates on foreign earnings considered permanently invested abroad and change in valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for a particular year will vary depending on the mix of foreign and domestic earnings  income tax credits and changes in previously established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based upon management s current analysis of the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
as foreign earnings considered permanently invested abroad increase as a percentage of consolidated earnings  the overall consolidated effective income tax rate will usually decrease because the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data operating results fiscal compared to fiscal continued foreign earnings are generally taxed at a lower rate than domestic earnings

the israeli expansion was no longer required with the acquisition of the inch  micron facility 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is mainly attributable to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in october as well as the increase in long term financing obligations in connection with orbit s newly acquired wafer fabrication facility 
amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is attributable to the amortization of the debt issue costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes issued in october and the amortization of the goodwill associated with the tti testron and chemtech acquisitions 
other income net decreased in fiscal mainly as the result of increased provisions for doubtful accounts receivable and lower net gains realized on the sales of property  plant and equipment in fiscal as compared with fiscal in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the estimated useful lives of certain equipment from four years to six years

year date conversion the year date conversion issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this issue affects computer systems that have time sensitive programs that may not properly recognize the year this could result in major system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
the company is currently addressing its internal year issue with modifications to existing programs and conversions to new programs 
the company is also communicating with customers  suppliers and financial institutions and others with whom it conducts business to help identify and resolve the year issue 
if necessary modifications and conversions by the company and those with whom it conducts business are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
the total cost associated with the required modifications and conversions is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and is being expensed as incurred 
the cost of addressing the year issue and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
