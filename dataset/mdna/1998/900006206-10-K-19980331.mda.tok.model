by the end of the first quarter of  the company had substantially developed its us direct sales infrastructure and marketing programs 
this sales group consisted of an executive level sales representative and the establishment of sales support  demonstration and implementation technical staff 
knowing that the process of carrying out numerous face to face demonstrations  developing customized implementation strategies for each potential customer and conducting the exhaustive testing required by each prospect results in an extended sales process  the company has taken a long term view of the sales development process 
the revolutionary nature of the turbochef technologies  coupled with the foodservice industry s general resistance to change  have also contributed to a long sales cycle 
customers currently taking cooking system deliveries on a regular basis include whitbread  various franchisees of cendant corporation formerly hfs incorporated  choice hotels international and turbochef europe limited

in june the company consummated the june offering  an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock which resulted in aggregate proceeds of approximately  net of the underwriter s discount and other offering costs of  year issues the year issue  which is common to most businesses  concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information as the year approaches

earnings per share  no 
disclosures of information about capital structure  no 
reporting comprehensive income and no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
statements and are required to be adopted in and statements and are required to be adopted in statement will require the company to report comprehensive income and its components with the same prominence as other financial statements

forward looking statements the company is continuing to utilize the proceeds from the june offering to expand its operations  including  among other things  continuing its product development activities and marketing efforts and to set up additional third party production operations for the manufacture of the company s cooking systems 
the company anticipates  based on its currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations including assumptions regarding the progress of its research and development efforts and its ability to reduce cooking system production costs that its current cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated revenues from operations  and payments received pursuant to the maytag alliance  will be sufficient to fund its operations and satisfy its contemplated capital requirements for at least the next months 
in the event that the company s plans change  or its assumptions change or prove to be incorrect  or cash balances and anticipated revenues otherwise prove to be insufficient  the company would be required to revise its plan of operations which revision would include a significant reduction in operating costs and or seek additional financing prior to the end of such period 
the company has no other current arrangements with respect to  or sources of  additional financing 
there can thus be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company  if and when needed  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the company has used a substantial portion of the proceeds of the june offering in an effort to expand its current level of operations and grow the company s business 
however  the company s future performance will be subject to a number of business factors  including those beyond the company s control  such as economic downturns and evolving industry needs and preferences  as well as to the level of the company s competition and the ability of the company to successfully market its products and effectively monitor and control its costs 
the company believes that increases in revenues sufficient to offset its expenses and result in its profitability could be derived from its currently proposed plans within the next months  if such plans are successfully completed 
these plans include i successfully develop and market new products through the maytag alliance  ii utilize the awareness created by the whitbread relationship and the early successes of turbochef europe to extend the company s marketing and sales efforts into other countries within the european union  iii further develop us product sales  iv introduce additional new products  v establish a dealer sales network and vi reduce the company s manufacturing costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement any of the foregoing plans  that either its revenues will increase or its rate of revenue growth will continue or that it will ever be able to achieve profitable operations 
as of december   the amount of backlog orders believed to be firm was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of december  the company anticipates that the majority of this backlog will be filled during the current year
