revenues in fiscal were million  down from revenues of million in fiscal due to an increased provision for product returns  a decline in technology licensing revenues  and modest declines in freehand and authorware revenues  which were partially offset by an increase in director product revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes cost of materials  royalties paid to third parties for licensed technology  amortization costs related to localization and acquired technology  reserves for excess and obsolete finished goods and raw materials inventories  and costs associated with order fulfillment 
cost of revenues was million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal and million in fiscal this reduction resulted in a nine percentage point increase in gross margin to of revenues for fiscal from fiscal the decrease in page costs  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  was due primarily to the effectiveness of various cost control programs implemented over the past year  the move to just in time manufacturing which resulted in lower inventory obsolescence and lower absolute inventory levels  and improved inventory review procedures 
the company believes these business process changes will result in ongoing sustained margin performance  however  gross margins may be adversely affected from time to time by the mix of distribution channels used by the company  the mix of products sold  and the mix of international versus domestic revenues 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  advertising  mail order costs  trade show expenses  and other public relations and marketing costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal to million from million in the prior year due to lower overall spending on various sales and marketing programs as a result of the company s efforts to reduce expenses  offset by planned increases in headcount 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased over fiscal expenses of million due to increased headcount  costs associated with the restructuring of the sales distribution channel including recruiting  severance costs and the resolution of disputed claims for market development funds  the timing of discretionary marketing expenses  the recording of uncollectible accounts receivable and increased travel 
the company expects sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as the company invests in various sales and marketing infrastructure programs  particularly in programs designed specifically for the web and for penetrating the enterprise 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  overhead  and professional service fees to support product development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  reflecting the company s investment in new product development 
the company expects research and development expenses in fiscal to increase in absolute dollars as the company continues to invest heavily in new products and technologies and the infrastructure to support such activities 
general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and benefits  fees for professional services  and overhead 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal and million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to increases in staffing  higher outside services fees  and legal fees associated with the class action suits 
the company expects general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be higher than fiscal levels in absolute dollars as the company continues to invest in building the infrastructure required to support the growth of the company

this estimate is based on current tax law  the operating structure of the company  and estimates of the geographic mix of earnings  and is subject to change 
net loss the net loss of million for fiscal was due primarily to one time charges for the acquisition of solis in the third quarter

management believes that existing cash and investments  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating requirements through at least fiscal factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those detailed below  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the actual results that the company achieves may differ materially from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
intense competition 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new product versions 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with one or more of the company s products 
these companies include adobe systems inc adobe  apple computer  inc  asymetrix corporation  corel corporation corel  metacreations corporation  and microsoft corporation microsoft 
as the company competes with larger competitors such as adobe  corel and microsoft across a broader range of product lines and different platforms  the company may face increasing competition from such companies 
rapidly changing technology 
the developing digital media  internet and online services markets  and the personal computer industry in general  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company must continuously update its existing products to keep page them current with changing technology and must develop new products to take advantage of new technologies that could render the company s existing products obsolete 
the company s future prospects are highly dependent on its ability to increase functionality of existing products in a timely manner and to develop new products that address new technologies and achieve market acceptance 
shorter product life cycles may lead to inventory obsolescence problems 
new products and enhancements must keep pace with competitive offerings  adapt to new platforms and emerging industry standards  and provide additional functionality 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
fluctuations of operating results  product introduction delays 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from its three key products director  freehand and authorware 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products  and such delays may occur in the future 
if the company was unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce such products in a timely manner  this inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
if the company does not ship new versions of its products as planned  sales of existing versions decline  or new products do not receive market acceptance  the company s results of operations in a given quarter could be materially adversely affected as they were during the fourth quarter of fiscal when the company delayed shipment of a new version of director to the following quarter 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may vary significantly depending on the impact of any of the following the timing of product introductions by competitors  changes in pricing  execution and volume of technology licensing agreements  the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast  and finally  any acquisitions of other companies or technologies 
the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  including the company s ability to continue to develop or acquire innovative products  its product and customer mix  and the level of competition 
the company s results of operations may also be affected by seasonal trends 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s forecasts  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase  or that new products introduced by the company  whether developed internally or acquired  will achieve market acceptance 
the company s historical rates of growth should not be taken as indicative of growth rates that can be expected in the future 
dependence on distributors 
a substantial majority of the company s revenues is derived from the sale of its products through a variety of distribution channels  including traditional software distributors  mail order  educational distributors  vars  original equipment manufacturers oems  hardware and software superstores  retail dealers  and direct sales 
domestically  the company s products are sold primarily through distributors  vars  and oems 
in particular  one distributor  ingram micro  inc  accounted for  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
internationally  the company s products are sold through distributors 
the company s resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including in some cases  products that are competitive with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide them with adequate levels of support 
in addition  the company believes that certain distributors are reducing their inventory in the channel and returning unsold products to better manage their inventories 
distributors are increasingly seeking to return unsold product  particularly when a new version or upgrade of a product has superseded such products 
if the company s distributors were to seek to return increasing amounts of products  such returns could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in sales volume to  a significant reseller could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
page dependence on macintosh platform 
in the past  a majority of the company s revenues was derived from its products for the macintosh 
although sales of the company s products for windows and cross platform environments accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal and are expected to become an increasingly important component of the company s revenues  the company remains heavily dependent on the sale of products for the macintosh platform 
a continuing leveling off or decline in the sales rate of multimedia capable macintosh computers or shifts in mail order or other distribution mechanisms for macintosh products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
risks of international operations 
for fiscal  the company derived approximately of its revenues from international sales 
the company expects that international sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of its revenues 
the company relies on distributors for sales of its products in foreign countries and  accordingly  is dependent on their ability to promote and support the company s products  and in some cases  to translate them into foreign languages 
international business is subject to a number of special risks  including foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  more prevalent software piracy  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  foreign currency risk  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
in addition  the company s results may be adversely affected by worldwide economic events beyond the control of the company  such as those presently occurring in asia 
approximately of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal were derived from the asia pacific region 
during fiscal  the company experienced a decline in revenue growth rates in asia pacific in part due to the economic crises that occurred throughout this region 
there can be no assurances that these economies will recover in the near term or that the company s results or growth rates in this geographic region will return to previous levels even if the recovery occurs 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce economic exposure associated with sales and asset balances denominated in various european currencies and japanese yen 
as of march   notional principal of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million 
these contracts are of a short term duration and the fair value of such contracts equals the market value as of march  there can be no assurance that such contracts will adequately hedge the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
risks associated with acquisitions 
macromedia has grown in part because of combinations with other companies 
in august  the company acquired fauve software  inc  a developer of image editing software 
in december  the company acquired osc  inc  a developer of digital audio production software 
in march  the company acquired iband  inc  a developer of internet web site development tools 
in december  the company acquired futurewave software  inc  a developer of internet graphics and animation software 
in october  the company acquired solis design  inc  a developer of computer managed instruction software for enterprise wide  web based learning solutions 
none of the recently acquired products has accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues to date 
additionally  there are integration risks associated with merging two companies including financial  administrative and cultural concerns 
volatility of stock 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to the company  changes in analysts earnings estimates for the company or its industry and page factors affecting the corporate environment or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties  including customers  vendors  and manufacturers  with whom the company deals on financial transactions worldwide 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
although the company does not believe there are any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems 
the company is assessing the impact to its operations of addressing the year issues 
the company believes that its software will handle year compliance correctly assuming that the operating systems upon which they run have been updated to comply 
macromedia s software products obtain date information  such as creation dates and modification dates  directly from the computer s operating system 
both microsoft and apple have stated that their operating systems will continue to operate properly into the twenty first century 
subsequent events in may  the company sold certain intellectual property rights to apple computer 
while the terms of the transaction have not been disclosed  the company expects this event to have a positive impact on net income through reduced research and development expenses and anticipated future royalty income
