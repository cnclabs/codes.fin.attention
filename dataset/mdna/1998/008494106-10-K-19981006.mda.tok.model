item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company included elsewhere herein 
the company is a vertically integrated agricultural seed company specializing in developing  packaging  processing and distributing varieties of forage and cool season turfgrass seeds 
the company also distributes corn  soybean and other seeds as ancillary products 
since january  the company has grown significantly through its business strategy of acquiring reputable  regionally based seed companies with proprietary products and established research  processing and distribution channels in their respective markets the acquisition program 
these acquisitions are summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically  the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the company s consolidated results beginning with the effective date of the acquisition in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
as discussed in note b of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has taken effective control of acquired businesses as of a mutually agreed upon effective date that precedes the closing date when consideration is transferred to the sellers 
the company has reflected the acquired businesses in its consolidated financial statements as of the effective date 
due to the size of the company and the internal focus on integration of acquired businesses  the company has changed its acquisition practices  to operate and acquire businesses at the closing date  instead of the effective date  for acquired businesses not included in the company s march  consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  as of april   the company records acquired businesses at the closing date 
the seed business is subject to wide seasonal fluctuations 
the significant number of acquisitions and the period for which each is included in the company s consolidated financial statements in relation to the seasonality of the business cycle of each acquisition significantly affects the meaningfulness of comparisons drawn between periods 
see also quarterly comparisons below 
subsequent to june   the company completed eight additional acquisitions 
the net sales for these entities are not included in the company s results of operations for fiscal the above factors may have significant impact on the following discussion and analysis and should be considered as part of it 
results of operations selected information concerning the results of operations dollars in thousands is summarized as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales    gross profit    percentage of net sales operating expenses    percentage of net sales the increases in the dollar amounts of the above items are primarily due to the company s acquisition program described above which results in certain operations not being included for the entire time periods listed above 
net sales 
during fiscal  the company had net sales of  as compared to  during fiscal and  during fiscal such amounts reflect the operations of  and acquisitions  respectively  beginning with the date of acquisition  as well as certain start up operations 
during fiscal  weather conditions in the areas that grow a significant amount of alfalfa seed that is sold for planting in warm climates resulted in a relatively small crop being harvested 
this resulted in reduced amounts of seed available for sale in fiscal weather in the united states has been significantly impacted by an el nino weather pattern 
several regions have been particularly hard hit by significant rainfall and flooding while other areas have been experiencing drought conditions  both of which have reduced the planting acreage for forage and turf crops 
this has negatively impacted business during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in addition  the company s net sales to pacific rim countries amounted to approximately of total net sales in fiscal and were adversely impacted by the recent economic conditions in those countries 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  primarily seed costs  were  or of net sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or of net sales  for fiscal and  or of net sales  for fiscal the increases were due to the acquisition program reflecting that i certain acquisitions have historically handled mostly lower margin public seed varieties while other acquisitions handle higher margin proprietary varieties  and ii the mix of products sold  in that turfgrass seed sales have historically commanded lower margins than forage seed sales 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit is due to the acquisition program 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage is primarily due to a significant change in the mix of products sold resulting from recent acquisitions which have a higher percent of turfgrass seed sales 
as is typical in the industry  abt s turfgrass seed companies use their suppliers  who are typically large farmers that grow seed  to also clean  process  package  store  and finance the seed prior to purchase 
this results in lower margins being captured by the turfgrass seed companies 
the company s goal is to raise gross margins over the next several years as a result of the company s attempt to consolidate the forage and turfgrass sector of the seed industry  vertically integrate its operations  and shift its product lines from primarily public varieties commodities to proprietary value added products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal and  in fiscal these increases are primarily due to the acquisition program 
however  operating expenses as a percent of net sales declined to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal to accomplish the company s business strategy  it has been necessary to build its operational infrastructure ahead of revenue growth 
as revenue continues to grow  operating expense as a percentage of sales is expected to decrease due to the spreading of the infrastructure costs over a larger sales base 
this ratio is expected to continue to decline as revenue growth continues to exceed growth in expenses and operating synergies occur through integration of the acquired companies into cohesive units 
the major components of operating expenses are personnel costs  occupancy expense  vehicle and shipping expenses  outside services  travel and advertising  all of which increased substantially in the current year compared to the prior year 
these increases are primarily due to the acquisition program 
the major components of operating expenses in thousands were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal personnel costs    occupancy expenses    vehicle and shipping   outside services  travel  advertising and promotion  personnel costs increased due to an increase in total employees to at june   as compared to at june  and at june  occupancy expenses increased resulting from the company utilizing warehouse operating locations at june   compared to at june  and at june  vehicle and shipping  outside services  travel and advertising expenses also increased as a result of the company s increased level of operations following the company s completion of acquisitions for each respective period 
research and development 
research and development expenditures were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal as the company attempts to transform its forage and turfgrass seed businesses to proprietary products with higher gross margins  the company expects that research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales will continue to increase and eventually be similar to public companies in the other proprietary seed sectors 
expenditures were low in relative to net sales due to the dependence of the company on licensing proprietary seed varieties 
research and development expenditures increased dramatically in fiscal due to the company s acquisition of w l research and burlingham and in fiscal with the acquisition of lofts 
w l research s operations contain a sizable genetic research program in alfalfa and burlingham s and lofts businesses include significant research programs for turfgrasses 
as discussed under item business  the company has recently entered into technology agreements with noble  global agro  ffr  and mycogen 
these agreements will increase the company s research and development expenditures in the future 
interest expense 
the company s interest expense increased to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal this was primarily due to increasing the company s line of credit plus additional borrowings to finance the acquisition program and working capital needs 
interest expense also includes imputed interest of  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal to account for the period of time between the effective and closing dates of the company s acquisitions 
income tax benefits 
sfas no 
provides that deferred taxes should be determined by first identifying types and amounts of existing temporary differences  the nature and amount of each type of operating loss carryforward  and the remaining length of the carryforward period 
total deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets are then measured by applying the enacted tax rate to the existing differences 
in addition  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years ordinarily shall be included in income from operations 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the period of reversal or the carryforward period available under the tax law and or future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities 
the company s business objective is to consolidate the forage and turfgrass sector of the seed industry and to then transform this sector from a low margin  commodity oriented business to a high margin  proprietary  value added business  so that the company is the partner of choice through which biotechnology will be introduced into this sector 
the company has undertaken an aggressive acquisition strategy to gain the critical mass necessary to achieve this objective 
consistent with the expected trends of a strategy which initially requires the building of infrastructure at the expense of revenue growth  the company has always anticipated losses for both financial reporting and income tax purposes in the early years of implementing its strategy  with such losses decreasing over time toward becoming both profitable and taxable 
at june   the company had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which amount was reduced by a valuation allowance of approximately million as required by sfas no 
 because the company was unable to conclude that it is more likely than not it will realize the deferred tax assets 
through the quarter ended march   the company reported approximately million of year to date book income before taxes  and forecast increasing future profits based on the assumptions of increased revenue growth  synergies to occur from the integration of acquired companies  and reduced product costs to be obtained through vertical integration 
based on this current performance and projections  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  and removed the valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately million in the quarter ended march  the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  including tax planning strategies applied to the timing of the reversals  will be available to offset all but approximately million of the deferred tax assets prior to the expiration of loss carryforwards  for which the company will need to generate approximately million over the next years from future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences to fully realize the company s deferred tax assets related to operations at june  the company projects sufficient future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to operations at june  the projections are based on the continued trend of operations and assumptions that increased profitability will be realized through increased revenue growth  synergies to occur from the integration of acquired companies  and reduced product costs to be achieved through vertical integration 
the trend from operations reflects a continued decrease in the amount of both book and tax losses for the past three years 
the continuation of this trend will result in the generation of future income 
the company s acquisition strategy has built the premiere forage and cool season turfgrass seed company in the united states 
as the company achieves the critical mass and infrastructure necessary to achieve profitability  the strategic focus will continue to shift to increasing profitability 
the company is positioned to transition towards this strategy as a result of the recent addition of key personnel with operations management experience in the seed and biotech industry  and now has sufficient size and scope of operations to generate future profitability 
additionally  the company expects to realize significant future cost savings from the vertical integration of acquired producing companies  which will eliminate the need to purchase from outside third parties at marked up prices 
further  a strategic planning process is being implemented  which will result in organizational restructuring with the intent of realizing cost synergies from the elimination of duplicate personnel  facilities  and processes 
the adjustments to the valuation allowance resulted in a net increase to the valuation allowance of  for the year ended june  these adjustments are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and are summarized below valuation allowance at june   increase from losses related to stock options  increase from losses on current year activity  reduction for expected realization of future benefits  reduction pursuant to deferred tax calculation on acquisitions  valuation allowance at june   net earnings losses 
net earnings for the company was  for fiscal  as compared to net losses of  in fiscal and  in fiscal as a result of the items discussed above 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the staff of the securities and exchange commission has taken a position regarding securities  such as the company s convertible preferred stock  containing conversion features allowing for conversion into common stock at a discount from future quoted market prices 
application to this position required the company to allocate an amount to the conversion feature and to account for it as a return to the holders of the securities  as well as to impute dividends on the convertible preferred stock 
this resulted in the net earnings loss attributable to common stock on which earnings loss per share is computed being decreased by  to  for fiscal  by  to  in fiscal and by  to  in fiscal average common shares outstanding used in computing earnings loss per common share increased due to additional shares issued  primarily for cash  acquisitions  options and warrants 
for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share for fiscal  average shares outstanding are increased by the dilutive effects of options  warrants  and convertible preferred stock outstanding during the year 
such items were anti dilutive and  therefore  excluded in fiscal and fiscal quarterly comparisons see overview above for a discussion of the company s acquisition program 
the table below sets forth quarterly operating data of the company for fiscal and fiscal this quarterly information is unaudited  but in management s opinion  reflects all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the period presented 
the forage and turfgrass seed sector have a seasonal sales cycle  as do other agribusinesses 
weather conditions and the economic outlook for alternative crops affect seed production yields  insect population and farmers planting decisions  which may  in turn  cause fluctuations in seed prices and annual sales 
a significant portion of the company s sales have historically been in the third fiscal quarter ending march for planting in late march through may 
the company s acquisitions of burlingham and olsen fennell added a significant amount of turfgrass seed sales in the first and second fiscal quarters of fiscal  primarily for overseeding golf courses  southern forage grasses  landscapes  and retail 
the successful consolidation by the company of the forage and cool season turfgrass seed sector is expected to balance  in part  seasonal sales fluctuations

liquidity and capital resources the following summarizes certain information concerning the company s financial condition june  in thousands working capital    property  plant  and equipment  net    short term debt    long term debt  including amounts due within one year    total stockholders equity    changes in the above items are primarily due to the acquisitions completed by the company  including changes in these items following the dates of acquisition due to growth and seasonality of the seed business and related financings 
information concerning increases decreases in certain operational assets and liabilities acquired in acquisitions and other changes is as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal acquis other acquis other acquis other itions changes itions changes itions changes in thousands accounts receivable       inventories     property  plant and equipment      accounts payable and accrued expenses       net earnings loss  adjusted for non cash impacts of depreciation  amortization  equity in earnings of associated entity  deferred income taxes  and common stock and options for services amounted to   and  for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal such amounts reflect the growth of the company due to the acquisition program and the items discussed under results of operation above 
these amounts and the changes in the levels of operational assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  inventories  and payables  resulted in total net cash used in operating activities being   and  for the years ended june   and the changes in operational assets and liabilities reflect changes in the levels of such items at fiscal year end from such levels at the beginning of the year or the acquisition date  if acquired during the year 
the impact of acquisitions is dependent upon the timing of the date of acquisition in relation to the highs and lows of such items caused by the seasonality of each acquired business 
the company had working capital of  at june   as compared to  at june  to finance acquisitions and ongoing operations  the company has raised significant amounts of equity capital 
during fiscal  the company received cash proceeds of  from the sale of  shares of its common stock and  warrants and  from the exercise of options and warrants to acquire the company s common stock 
the company also received  in payments on notes receivable at june  from the exercise of options and warrants prior to june  subsequent to june   the company received gross cash proceeds of  from the sale of  shares of common stock and  warrants 
during fiscal  the company received cash proceeds of  from the exercise of existing options and warrants  including payments on notes receivable for warrants and options exercised 
in addition  the company received gross proceeds of million from the private placement of its series c preferred stock during fiscal the company paid commissions equal to of the gross proceeds 
during fiscal  the company received cash proceeds of  from the exercise of existing options and warrants  including payments on notes receivable for warrants exercised 
to facilitate raising capital to fund the company s acquisition program and operations and to clean up its capital structure  the company arranged for options previously issued to consultants and other non employees to be transferred to other non affiliates who exercised them in accordance with their stated terms 
at the time of this arrangement  the market price of the company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of the options 
the difference between the market price and exercise price  deemed to be a preferential dividend to these stockholders for accounting purposes  aggregated approximately million 
however  since the company had no retained earnings  such amount would be charged to capital in excess of par value and would be offset by a deemed contribution to capital in excess of par value resulting in no change in stockholders equity 
the options were assigned to persons  primarily stockholders  whom the company believed would exercise them to provide needed capital at a time when there was a general downward trend in the price of the company s common stock  while also reducing the amount of dilutive options outstanding 
the company also completed the private placement of  shares of its series b convertible preferred stock during fiscal  receiving  before commissions and expenses 
the company entered into a revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility on june   with bankamerica business credit  inc babc  and certain other financial institutions 
under the revolving credit facility  the company has a maximum borrowing availability of up to million subject to a borrowing base computation and compliance with certain financial covenants  and may borrow  repay and reborrow revolving loans 
the revolving credit facility expires on june  as of june   the company had borrowed approximately million 
initially borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to pay off amounts outstanding under three separate short term credit facilities and certain items of term debt 
at september   approximately million was outstanding and million was available under the revolving line of credit 
the company may elect to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility that bear interest at a variable rate equal to the reference rate of bank of america plus or at a variable rate of interest equal to the applicable london interbank offered rate of the bank plus 
the revolving credit facility is secured by collateral consisting of substantially all the assets excluding fixed assets and real property of the company and its subsidiaries 
the terms of the revolving credit facility contain operating and financial covenants  including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of cash flow to debt service and a maximum ratio of total debt to equity 
standard poor s assigned its single b rating to the revolving credit facility and a single b corporate credit rating to the company 
on august   the company and babc amended the revolving credit facility to provide for borrowings of million in excess of amounts allowed under the borrowing base computation the babc bridge this additional borrowing carries a fixed interest rate of percent and expires on december the company entered into a bridge loan facility the deutsche bridge on july  with deutsche bank ag  which provided the company with million of unsecured bridge financing that matures on january  at the company s option  interest on the deutsche bridge is the bank s base rate or libor rate plus prior to september   per annum above such rates from then to november  and above such rates thereafter 
at september   the entire million was outstanding 
the company is in compliance with its debt agreements or has obtained waivers for instances of non compliance 
the additional equity raised subsequent to june   along with proceeds of the babc bridge and the deutsche bridge  were primarily used to fund the acquisitions completed after july  as described in note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company had long term obligations including current installments of approximately million at june  and million at june  the long term obligations consisted of mortgages  capital leases  covenants not to compete and deferred compensation 
in addition  the company has guaranteed the proceeds from the sale of common stock by certain former owners of certain acquired companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes  based on current plans and assumptions relating to its operations  that borrowings under the revolving credit facility will provide sufficient resources to fund the company s operations through june   including acquisitions completed through september  however  the company may need to seek an increase in or an alternative to the revolving credit facility to finance increased working capital needs should additional acquisitions be consummated in the future 
furthermore  the seed business is subject to wide seasonal fluctuations  which result in a significant increase in the level of inventory prior to and during the heavier selling season in the spring and related higher levels of accounts receivable following such sales through the early summer 
this also reflects industry practice that dictates a significant amount of sales of certain products are made with extended terms through mid summer 
in addition  the seed business can be significantly impacted by the weather  which can alter the timing and nature of crops planted by farmers which  in turn  affects the timing and nature of seed sales 
for these reasons  or if acquisitions are completed more rapidly than anticipated it is possible that the company may need to seek additional financial resources to finance ongoing operations 
in addition  the company will need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund acquisitions and to repay the deutsche bridge and the babc bridge 
management information systems and year as a result of acquisitions completed to date  the company has several different data processing systems in use 
these systems are substantially the same systems that were in use prior to their acquisition by the company 
the preliminary assessment of reaching the year is that these systems are generally not compliant 
some of the non compliant systems can be easily updated to be compliant but a number of these systems can not be updated because of software and hardware limitations 
the company is in the process of integrating its systems into one company wide information system and has contracted for software  hardware and consulting services to implement an enterprise resource planning erp system to meet its current information system requirements 
the cost of this implementation is not expected to exceed million  which amount includes internal costs for personnel  training  supplies  travel and equipment 
at june   the company had incurred approximately million of these costs 
the implementation costs are funded through operations  the credit facilities described above  and approximately  of financing provided by one of the vendors 
it is possible that the company may seek additional financing for the implementation costs  either in the form of project financing or as part of other financing obtained by the company 
the company has completed preliminary testing and design and is beginning the implementation phase 
the initial phase encompasses the implementation of the system at five operating sites and developing a rapid implementation methodology which will be used to integrate the remaining operating entities 
the company plans to integrate these entities whereby the largest operating units would be integrated first such that all significant operating units are integrated by june  the erp and related network and hardware systems are designed to be year compliant 
local area networks lans  desktop hardware  and desktop operating systems in some cases are not compliant 
the company has determined that the non compliant desktop and lan systems will be converted either through normal attrition or through the erp implementation 
the company believes that it has allocated adequate resources to ensure that all information systems are year compliant 
the company expects its year program to be successfully completed on a timely basis prior to january  however  there can be no assurance that this will be accomplished 
in the event any operating units remain year non compliant in late  the company s contingency plan is twofold 
first  where possible  the company is in the process of identifying reparation for existing software that is available as an upgrade  patch  or limited re coding data field masks  editing date related computations  or as a temporary workaround 
secondly  the company is in the process of identifying the potential to encapsulate data information as a temporary measure until the software or systems can be replaced 
completion of the assessment of these alternatives is anticipated to be completed by march  in the worst case scenario  the company can resort at the operating unit level to simple desktop accounting packages that are year compliant 
the company estimates that the overall risk to its operations as a result of non compliance with year for its existing systems in a worst case scenario to be less than  however  there can be no assurance that this estimate is the absolute maximum 
the ability of third parties with whom the company transacts business to adequately address their year issues is outside of the company s control 
the company is taking steps to confirm that the systems of its suppliers and customers are year compliant and to determine whether the nature of any noncompliance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates this process will be completed no later than june  there can be no assurance that the failure of the company or such third parties to adequately address their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on the company s operations to date 
the cost of seed products is largely affected by seed yields and alternative crop prices  which have not generally been greatly impacted by inflation 
however  there has been some upward movement in the cost of goods sold as a result of worldwide shortages of crops such as corn and wheat 
the costs which are normally impacted by inflation  such as wages  transportation and energy  are a relatively small part of the company s total operations 
however  the company remains subject to possible significant inflation in mexico  argentina and other foreign countries 
impact of accounting standards not yet adopted the impact of recently adopted accounting standards is discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the normal course of business  the company is subject to a variety of market risks  including  but not limited to  interest rate movements and collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company routinely monitors these risks and takes actions to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although the company does not anticipate any material losses in these areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  nor does the company have any financial instruments entered into for trading purposes 
the company s financial instruments are not subject to significant foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk  or equity price risk 
other financial instruments are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
long term obligations and short term debt are discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  including the extent of such items that bear interest at variable rates 
an increase or decrease in the interest rate of basis points on the company s revolving line of credit would decrease or increase the company s pre tax earnings by one percent of the average amount outstanding under the line of credit 
the average short term debt is significantly impacted by the level and timing of acquisitions  the results of operations  and the timing and amount of permanent capital raised 
such average was approximately million for the year ended june
