year computer problems the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in major system failure or miscalculations
