item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
it should be noted that the company is affected by various factors such as regulatory actions  economic conditions  the general business environment  as well as by the competition 
accordingly  historical performance may not be a reliable indicator of future earnings 
results of operations

interest income and resultant yield information in the table are on a taxable equivalent basis using an assumed tax rate of 
yields and amounts earned include loan fees 
non accrual loans have been included in interest earning assets for purposes of these computations 
net interest income is the largest single component of the company s earnings and represents the difference between interest income received on loans and other earning assets and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  was million in  an increase of million or from as summarized on table  the million increase in net interest income for consisted of a million increase in interest income that was partly offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the million increase in interest income was primarily due to the million increase in the average level of taxable investment securities and the basis point increase in yields which offset the effect to the million decrease in average loans outstanding 
interest costs on interest bearing liabilities were relatively stable with an increase of only million in the increase primarily was a result of deposit shifts from the lower cost savings deposits to higher cost time deposits 
provision and allowance for credit losses the amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic evaluations by management 
in these evaluations  management considers numerous factors including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  prior loan loss experience and management s estimation of potential losses 
these various analyses lead to a determination of the amount needed in the allowance for credit losses 
to the extent the existing allowance is below the amount so determined  a provision is made that will bring the allowance to such an amount 
thus  the provision for credit losses may fluctuate and may not be comparable from year to year 
the company s allowance for credit losses increased to million at december   from million in and million in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period end total loans was at december   compared to and at and at december  and  the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired was million and million  respectively 
the total allowance for loan losses related to these loans was million and million on december  and  respectively

other income in  other income was million as compared to million in and million in the decline in was primarily attributable to the million decline in net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities 
the company sold its merchant accounts portfolio in and its credit card portfolio in resulting in the loss of commissions and fees relating to these discontinued operations 
other income includes an annual million gain resulting from the amortization of the deferred gain recognized in a manner similar to a sale lease back transaction of the company s headquarters in this deferred gain of million is amortized over a period of years

on january   the company announced a major initiative to further improve operating efficiency and decrease expenses by offering a vsp to all employees 
the program offered all eligible employees the opportunity of electing to terminate their employment ninety seven employees participated in the vsp and voluntary separation benefits of approximately million were expensed and paid total compensation expense  which comprises the largest category of other operating expenses  decreased by million in to million 
this decrease was attributable to the implementation of the company s vsp in and its resulting reduction of personnel 
the increase in net occupancy expense in was primarily attributable to the increased occupancy costs of the association from its ground lease obligation of vacated premises 
see note o of the company s consolidated financial statements 
deposit insurance premiums decreased million to million in a special assessment on the association s deposit base as of march  of million was recorded in the assessment was the result of legislation passed by the united states congress to strengthen the insurance fund administered by the savings association insurance fund saif

liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order that the cash flow needs of the company are met in the most economical and expedient manner 
the liquidity needs of a financial institution require the availability of cash to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors and the credit commitments of borrowers 
in order to optimize liquidity  management monitors and forecasts the various sources and uses of funds in an effort to continually meet the financial requirements of the company and the financial needs of its customer base 
to ensure liquidity on a short term basis  the company s primary sources are cash or cash equivalents  loan repayments  proceeds from the sale of assets available for sale  increases in deposits  proceeds from maturing securities and  when necessary  federal funds purchased and credit arrangements with correspondent banks and the fhlb 
maturities of investment securities are also structured to cover large commitments and seasonal fluctuations in credit arrangements 
the consolidated statements of cash flows identify three major sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities 
cash generated from operations represents a source of liquidity 
as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows of this annual report  the company s operating activities used million in  compared to providing million in  and million in investing activities reduced cash flow by million during  compared to an increase of million in  and a reduction of million in the primary source of cash flow from investing activities in was from the sales and maturities of investment securities 
financing activities increased cash flow by million during  compared to a reduction of million in and an increase of million in during  increases in time deposits accounted for the increase in cash flows from financing activities 
as of december   the bank and association had available unused credit lines of million from the fhlb and committed available lines of credit from other sources 
at any time  the company has outstanding commitments to extend credit 
see notes h  i and n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset liability management asset liability management involves the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities to reduce interest rate exposure while also providing liquidity 
the company s management has placed an increased emphasis on interest rate sensitivity management 
interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities are those which have yields or rates which are subject to change within a future time period due to either the maturity of the instrument or changes in the rate environment 
gap refers to the difference between the rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
when the amount of rate sensitive assets is in excess of rate sensitive liabilities  a positive gap exists  and when the opposite occurs  a negative gap exists 
generally  when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin is expected to be positively impacted during periods of increasing interest rates and negatively impacted during periods of decreasing interest rates 
interest rate shifts  resulting from movements in the economic environment  can cause interest sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice within relatively short time frames 
as a result  major fluctuations in net interest income and net earnings could occur due to imbalances between rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
asset liability management seeks to protect earnings by maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to minimize fluctuations in the net interest margin and net earnings in periods of volatile interest rates 
the company s policy is to closely match its level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within a limited range  thereby reducing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in connection with these asset and liability management objectives  various actions have been taken  including changes in the composition of assets and liabilities  and the use of financial instruments 
the financial instruments used and their notional amounts outstanding at year end were as follows december  dollars in thousands interest rate swaps pay fixed swaps notional amount    average receive rate average pay rate under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amount 
the company pays the fixed rate and receives the floating rate under the majority of its swaps outstanding at december   and  respectively 
interest rate contracts are primarily used to convert certain deposits and long term debt to floating interest rates or to convert certain groups of customer loans and other interest earning assets to fixed rates 
certain interest rate swaps specifically match the amounts and terms of particular liabilities 
see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosure of financial instruments 
the table on the following page sets forth information concerning interest rate sensitivity of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first 
in the case of amortizing assets such as mortgage loans  for example maturities are reflected in terms of the expected principal repayment streams  based upon scheduled amortization and anticipated prepayments 
prepayments are estimated using current market expectations for assets with interest rates at similar levels to the company s 
it should be noted that while the company s investment portfolio is classified according to repricing or maturity  most of the portfolio is available for sale 
this will provide the company with the flexibility to restructure the portfolio if it wishes to in the face of a changing interest rate environment 
further note should be taken of the short term classification of most of the company s savings deposits 
in fact  although technically immediately repriceable  most of these deposits are considered to be relatively insensitive to changes in market interest rates

market risk other than trading activities market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure if nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet as well as for off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  estimated rate change nii sensitivity bp bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including haw customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates when appropriate alco may utilize off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
a board of directors approved hedging policy statement governs use of these instruments 
as of december  the company had  in notional principal amounts of interest rate swaps outstanding 
see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the estimated effects of these derivative financial instruments on the company s earnings are included in the sensitivity analysis presented above 
capital resources the company has a strong capital base with a tier capital ratio of at december  this is well above the minimum regulatory guideline of for tier capital 
bank holding companies are also required to comply with risk based capital guidelines as established by the federal reserve board 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  that include both on and off balance sheet exposures 
a company s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital the numerator of the ratio by its risk weighted assets the denominator 
the minimum required qualifying total capital ratio is 
as of december   the company s total capital to risk adjusted assets ratio was 
effects of inflation the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate changes have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
in  the company entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb 
under the terms of the mou  the company is required to receive the approval of the frb prior to the payment of dividends  redemption of stock and incurring debt 
in september  city bank also entered into a mou with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the mou requires  among other things  that city bank obtain approval from the fdic for the payment of cash dividends  and to reduce certain classified assets to specified levels within time frames set forth

quarterly results of operations unaudited earnings for the fourth quarter of were million per share  a decrease of million from the million per share during the same quarter in the decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to the increase in provision for credit losses  which increased by million when compared to the same quarter in see further discussion in management s discussion and analysis of other expenses

accordingly  the year may produce erroneous results since there is a question as to how existing application software will react when the two digit year becomes 
the company is taking steps toward ensuring that its computer systems will be year compliant 
in  both subsidiary institutions are scheduled to convert their core processing to the fiserv comprehensive banking system 
the fiserv comprehensive banking system is widely used in the banking industry and fiserv has given certain assurances that its system will be year compliant 
in  the company and its subsidiaries formed year project teams to identify additional software systems and computer related devices that require modification for the year a project plan with goals and target dates was developed 
the project teams regularly monitor the progress of the plan 
the company has incurred expenses in related to this project and will continue to incur expenses over the next two years 
expenses that the company has incurred are primarily those related to the reassignment of existing personnel to the project 
incremental expenses are not expected to materiallyimpact operating results in any one period 
the company could be impacted by the year date change to the extent that third parties and customers have not successfully addressed the year issues 
the company has taken actions to help reduce this exposure and will continue to do so on an ongoing basis 
the company will continue to monitor the progress of critical third parties and will implement contingency plans in the event that such third parties fail to achieve their plans 
however  there can be no assurance that any contingency plans will fully mitigate the effects of any such failure
