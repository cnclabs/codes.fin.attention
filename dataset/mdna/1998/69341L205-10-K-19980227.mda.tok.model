over the last three years  the company used the proceeds from equipment sales and cash from operations to reduce subordinated indebtedness by million  resulting in reduced interest costs 
these reductions have helped offset the increased borrowing activity and interest costs associated with the expansion of the afg lease portfolio 
in addition  the reduction in transportation equipment lease revenues will continue to be increasingly offset by lease revenues generated from commercial and industrial equipment leases associated with afg 
with the exception of the company s aircraft and intermodal trailer fleet  the company does not anticipate continued substantial reductions in its owned equipment portfolio in and beyond 
the company continues to benefit from cost reduction measures  principally reflecting reductions in total company staffing since
