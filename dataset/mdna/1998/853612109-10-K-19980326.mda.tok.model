item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors affecting the results of operations and the significant changes in balance sheet items of smc on a consolidated basis for the periods listed as well as smc s liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the smc consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
introduction smc acquired standard management international on december   dixie national life on october   shelby life on november  and savers life on march  these acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting effective december  for the standard management international acquisition  october  for the dixie national life acquisition  november  for the shelby life acquisition  and march  for the savers life acquisition 
therefore  these subsidiaries are included in the smc consolidated financial statements commencing with their respective acquisition effective dates 
smc disposed of first international on march  effective march  and terminated the operations of standard reinsurance on march  product profitability 
margins on life insurance and annuity products are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
rising interest rates would result in a decline in the market value of assets 
however  as there are positive cash flows from renewal premiums  investment income and maturities of existing assets  the need for early disposition of investment assets to meet operating cash flow requirements would be unlikely 
rising interest rates would also result in available cash flows from maturities being invested at higher interest rates  which would help support a gradual increase in new business and renewal interest rates on interest sensitive products 
a sharp  sudden rise in the interest rate environment without a concurrent increase in crediting rates could result in higher surrenders  particularly for annuities 
the effect of surrenders would be to reduce earnings over the long term 
earnings in the period of the surrender could increase or decrease depending on whether surrender charges were applicable and whether such changes differed from the write off of related deferred acquisition costs or present value of future profits 
when interest rates fall  smc generally attempts to adjust the credited interest rates subject to competitive pressures 
although smc believes that such strategies will continue to permit it to achieve a positive spread  a significant decline in the yield on smc s investments could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of smc 
purchased insurance business 
in accordance with industry practice  when smc purchases additional insurance businesses it assigns a portion of the purchase price  called the present value of future profits  to the right to receive future cash flows arising from existing insurance policies 
this asset is recorded when the business is purchased at the value of projected future cash flows on existing policies  less a discount to present value 
as future cash flows emerge  they are treated as a recovery of this asset 
therefore  if cash flows emerging from the purchased or recaptured business during a period exactly equal the projections  they are offset by that period s amortization of the cost of the policies purchased 
in that event  the only income statement effect from the purchased business is the realization of the discount that was initially deducted from the asset to reflect its present value 
changes in the future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on the results of operations  because the amount of amortization is expected to be equal to the profits emerging from the purchased policies  net of interest on the unrecovered present value of future profits balance 
this asset is amortized over the expected life of the related policies purchased 
present value of future profits is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
in selecting the interest rate to calculate the discounted present value of the projected future profits  smc used the risk rate of return it needs to earn in order to invest in the business being acquired or recaptured 
in determining this required rate of return  smc considers the following factors the magnitude of the risks associated with each of the actuarial assumptions used in determining expected future cash flows as described above 
our cost of the capital required to fund the acquisition or recapture 
the likelihood of changes in projected future cash flows that might occur if there are changes in insurance regulations and tax laws 
the acquired company s compatibility with other smc activities that may favorably affect future cash flows 
the complexity of the acquired company or recaptured business 
recent prices ie  discount rates used in determining valuations paid by others to acquire or recapture similar blocks of business 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected future profits is used to determine the subsequent amortization of the cost of the purchased policies for acquisitions prior to november  for acquisitions subsequent to november   the discount rate used to amortize the unamortized balance of the present value of future profits is the crediting rate of the underlying policies 
the discount rate selected may affect subsequent earnings in those instances where the purchase price of the policies exceeds the value of net assets acquired including the value of future profits discounted at the selected interest rate 
selection of a lower or higher discount rate will increase or decrease the portion of the purchase price assigned to the present value of future cash flows and will result in an offsetting decrease or increase in the amount of the purchase price assigned to goodwill 
the effect on subsequent earnings caused by this variation in purchase price allocation will depend on the characteristics of the policies purchased 
for products where the profits emerge at relatively constant levels over an extended period of time for example  most of smc s immediate and deferred annuities  use of a lower rate may result in an increase in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by a decrease in earnings in later years 
for products where profits emerge over a shorter period of time or in amounts that decrease over the life of the product for example  ordinary and term life products  selection of a lower rate will generally result in a decrease in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by an increase in reported earnings in later years 
for smc  the majority of the cost of policies purchased relates to ordinary life products and the balance to deferred annuity products 
the activity related to the present value of future profits of the business acquired or recaptured is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  beginning of year    amounts related to acquisitions and disposals    net amortization during the year   adjustments relating to net unrealized gain losses on securities available for sale balance  end of year    the percentage of future expected net amortization of the beginning balance of the present value of future profits before the effect of net unrealized gains and losses  based on the present value of future profits at december  and current assumptions as to future events on all policies in force  will be between and in each of the years through the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future profits for business acquired prior to november   reflected in smc s december  consolidated balance sheet ranged from to 
smc used a discount rate to calculate the present value of future profits on the business of the dixie national life acquisition  which is being amortized over years as the majority of the present value of future profits related primarily to the ordinary life business 
smc used a discount rate to calculate the present value of future profits on the business of the shelby life acquisition  which is being amortized over years based on the mix of annuity and life business in shelby life 
produced insurance business 
insurance products generate two types of profit streams i from the excess of investment income earned over that credited to the policyholder and ii from the excess of premiums received over costs incurred for policy issuance  administration and mortality 
costs incurred in issuing new policies are deferred and recorded as deferred acquisition costs dac  which are amortized using present value techniques so that profits are realized in proportion to premium revenue for certain products and estimated gross profits for certain other products 
profits from all of these elements are recognized over the lives of the policies  no profits are recorded at the time the policies are issued 
amortization of dac was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of dac as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge 
dac of  at december  and additions to policy acquisition costs of  for business produced during the year ended december  are generally being amortized over the expected lives of the policies  a period of approximately years  in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
interest is being accreted at during year one and thereafter  the projected crediting rate on the policies 
dac is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
the offset to these amounts is recorded directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes 
future expected amortization of dac for the next five years before the effect of net realized and unrealized gains and losses  based on dac at december  and current assumptions  is as follows in thousands gross amortization      interest accreted  net amortization      the amounts included in the foregoing table do not include any amortization of dac resulting from the sale of new products after december  any changes in future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on results of operations because the amount of amortization is expected to be proportionate to the profits from the produced policies  net of interest on dac 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums collected  investment spreads  mortality costs  surrender benefits  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the cost of policies purchased or the cost of policies produced  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
accounting for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products 
the company primarily accounts for its annuity and universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas no 
 a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
such revenues do not include the annuity and universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 
costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses  approximately of initial annuity premium deposits and of premiums from universal and interest sensitive life products for smc  are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
unit linked product accounting 
separate account assets and liabilities are maintained primarily for contracts of which the majority represents unit linked products where benefits on surrender and maturity are not guaranteed 
they generally represent funds held in accounts to meet specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the investment risk 
investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to such policyholders 
smc earns income from the investment management fee it charges on such unit linked contracts  which range from 
to of the value of the underlying separate accounts 
discussion of changes in the consolidated statement of operations from year ended december  to year ended december  operating income 
the income from operations before net realized investment gains and gain on disposal of subsidiaries was  in  or 
per share  compared to  for  or 
per share 
the increase resulted primarily from operations in the united states producing income from operations of  for compared to a loss of  for the increase is primarily due to an increase in interest spreads on an increasing asset base 
the income from international operations also increased to  for compared to  for the international operating income resulted primarily from increased fees from an increase in value of assets under separate accounts and deceased operating expenses  primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar 
premium income 
gaap premium income for was  a decrease of  or from  for this decrease is attributable to the recapture of premiums ceded of  in due to the termination and recapture of a reinsurance agreement with national mutual which offset the increase in premium income for the inclusion of shelby life in the results of operations for periods after november  the shelby life block of business recorded net premium income of  in net premiums received from the sales of interest sensitive annuities and other financial products which are not recorded as revenues were  compared to  for and  respectively 
the increase in premium deposits is partially due to an increase in gross domestic premium deposits 
gross domestic premium deposits received from interest sensitive annuities and financial products were  for compared to  for the increase in gross domestic premium is the result of an aggressive marketing campaign targeted to high volume marketing companies 
also contributing to the increase in premiums is the continued development of smc s distribution system through marketing support from standard marketing  an aggressive program aimed at retaining key producers  and an increase in the agency base achieved by expanding geographical concentration into the mid south and california 
since smc s operating income is primarily a function of its investment spreads  persistency of annuity in force business mortality experience and operating expenses  a change in premium deposits in a single period does not directly cause operating income to change  although continued increases or decreases in premiums may affect the growth rate of total assets on which investment spreads are earned 
net investment income 
net investment income increased  or to  for from  for the increase resulted from an increase in total invested assets amortized cost of approximately from december  to december   most of which occurred in the fourth quarter of due to the acquisition of shelby life  and an increase in the weighted average net yield of smc s investment portfolio exclusive of realized and unrealized gains to from for and  respectively 
the continued growth in smc s total invested assets reflects increased sales of fpdas and the inclusion of the invested assets of shelby life of approximately  in the consolidated balance sheet effective november  net realized investment gains 
net realized investment gains decreased  or to  from  for and  respectively 
net realized investment gains fluctuate from period to period and arise when securities are sold in response to changes in the investment environment which provide opportunities to maximize return on the investment portfolio without adversely affecting the quality and overall yield of the investment portfolio 
the pretax net unrealized gain on the company s fixed maturity portfolio was  at december   compared to a pretax net unrealized loss of  at december  in the absence of continued decreases in interest rates the company may be unable to realize gains on its investment portfolio at the levels of prior years or could recognize losses from sales of securities prior to maturity 
the company s future earnings could be adversely affected to the extent it is unable to realize gains on its investment portfolio 
gain on disposal of subsidiaries 
on march   smc completed the sale of a duplicate charter associated with first international to giac 
smc received sale proceeds of  including  for the charter and licenses associated with first international 
standard life realized a net pre tax gain of  on this sale 
in addition  first international  standard life and giac have entered into a series of agreements that include provisions for standard life to retain the economic interest in certain first international policies and administer first international policies in force at the date of such sale 
in an unrelated matter  smc decided in february to terminate the reinsurance agreement between standard reinsurance and salamandra  and not to renew the barbados license of standard reinsurance 
this resulted in a write off of smc s investment in standard reinsurance and certain intangible assets of standard reinsurance amounting to  the combined effect of the pre tax gain on the sale of first international and related contracts  and the standard reinsurance write offs  was  pre tax and  after tax in policy charges 
policy charges  which represent the amounts assessed against policyholder account balances for the cost of insurance  policy administration and surrenders  increased  or to  for compared to  for the increase in policy charges resulted from an increase in policy charges for standard life s universal life insurance products of  due to the inclusion of shelby life in the results of operations for periods after november   and an increase in policy surrender charges on fpdas of  the increase in annuity policy withdrawals and surrender charges on flexible premium deferred annuities generally corresponds to the aging and growth of smc s annuity business in force 
fees from separate accounts 
fees from separate accounts increased  or to  for from  for this increase is due primarily to an increase in the value of assets held in separate accounts from  at december  to  at december  net deposits from sales of unit linked products by standard management international were  and  for and  respectively 
such income fluctuates in relationship to total separate account assets and the return earned on such assets 
benefits and claims 
benefits and claims decreased  or to  for from  for the decrease in benefits and claims in resulted primarily from an increase in change in policy reserves of  in related to the termination and recapture of the reinsurance agreement with national mutual 
this decrease offset the increase in benefits and claims from adverse mortality experience and the inclusion of shelby life approximately  in in the results of operations for periods after november  throughout smc s history  it has experienced both periods of higher and lower benefits and claims 
such volatility is not uncommon in the life insurance industry and  over extended periods of time  periods of higher claims experience tend to be offset by periods of lower claims experience 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products was  for  an increase of  or from  for the increase resulted from the inclusion of interest credited of  from shelby life products  increases in interest credited rates on new annuity sales and the increases in the growth in policy reserves for fpdas from sales 
at december   the weighted average interest credited rate for standard life s currently marketed annuities and other financial product liabilities was compared to at december  salaries and wages 
salaries and wages were  for  an increase of  or from  for this increase was caused primarily by an increase in the average wages per employee in and an increase in the number of employees from at january  to at december  amortization 
amortization expense increased  or to  for from  for the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from the amortization of present value of future profits of  in for the acquisition of shelby life 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased  or to  for from  for the decrease in other operating expenses resulted primarily from eliminating in the additional cost to convert the operations and expand the marketing effort in dixie national life incurred in and a reduction in international operating expenses due to the strengthening of the us dollar 
interest expense and financing costs 
interest expense and financing costs increased  or to  for from  for the increase in interest expense and financing costs during resulted primarily from increased borrowing of  in november on the amended credit agreement and borrowings of  from an unaffiliated insurance company in connection with the acquisition of shelby life and additional borrowings of  in connection with funding capital contributions to an insurance subsidiary and redemption of class s preferred stock in federal income taxes 
federal income tax expense credit was  for  compared to  for the large credit in is primarily due to tax benefits of  related to the sale of first international 
extraordinary gain on early redemption of redeemable preferred stock 
extraordinary gains were recorded on the early redemption of the class s preferred stock for the amounts by which the repurchase price for the class s preferred stock was below its book value plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
smc recorded no extraordinary gain for compared to a  gain for effective august   smc redeemed all of its issued and outstanding class s preferred stock at redemption value of per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends 
discussion of changes in the consolidated statement of operations from year ended december  to year ended december  operating income 
the income from operations before net realized investment gains and gain on disposal of subsidiaries  was  in  or 
per share  compared to  for  or 
per share 
the change resulted primarily from international operations producing income from operations of  compared a loss of to  for and  respectively 
the international operating gains resulted primarily from increased management fees on an increasing separate account base due to portfolio sales in and  and increased value of assets under management  coupled with a decrease in marketing costs in when compared to the income loss from operations in the united states decreased to  in compared to  in the decline was attributable to an increase in interest expense from borrowings to repurchase common stock  class s preferred stock and the purchase of shelby life and additional costs to convert the operations and expand the marketing effort in dixie national life 
premium income 
gaap premium income for the was  an increase of  or from  for this increase is mainly attributable to recapture of premiums ceded of  due to the termination and recapture of a reinsurance agreement with national mutual and the inclusion of dixie national life and shelby life in the results of operations for periods after october  and november   respectively 
these amounts offset the decline in premiums from the cession of a portion of first international s life insurance business and the regular policy lapses  surrenders and expiries in smc s closed blocks of business 
net premiums received from the sales of interest sensitive annuities and other financial products which are not recorded as revenues were  compared to  for and  respectively 
the increase in premium deposits is partially due to an increase in gross domestic premium deposits 
gross domestic premium deposits received from interest sensitive annuities and financial products were  for compared to  for the increase is the result of an aggressive marketing campaign implemented by standard life with increased crediting interest rates 
first year interest crediting rates were increased approximately on certain fpdas sold after april  also contributing to the increase in premiums is the continued development of smc s distribution system through marketing support from standard marketing and an increase in the agency base achieved through the recruitment of larger managing general agencies and expanding geographical concentration into the mid south and california 
smc also decreased the quota share portion of business ceded pursuant to a reinsurance agreement from to at september   which was further decreased to effective april  premium deposits ceded pursuant to this reinsurance agreement reduced net premium deposits by  in compared to  in net investment income 
net investment income increased  or to  for from  for the increase primarily resulted from an increase in total invested assets amortized cost of approximately from to  most of which occurred in the fourth quarter due to the acquisition of shelby life 
the weighted average net yield on smc s invested assets was for both and the continued growth in smc s total invested assets reflects increased sales of fpdas and the inclusion of the invested assets of dixie national life of approximately  and shelby life of approximately  in the consolidated balance sheet effective october  and november   respectively  which was offset by the invested assets ceded in the giac reinsurance transaction of approximately  net realized investment gains 
net realized investment gains increased  or to  from  for and  respectively 
the increase primarily resulted from active portfolio management by smc 
net realized investment gains fluctuate from period to period and arise when securities are sold in response to changes in the investment environment which provide opportunities to maximize return on the investment portfolio without adversely affecting the quality and overall yield of the investment portfolio 
policy charges 
policy charges increased  or to  for compared to  for the increase in policy charges resulted from an increase in policy surrender charges on fpdas of  and the inclusion of dixie national life and shelby life in operating results for periods after october  and november   respectively  for an increase of  which offset a decrease of  for the absence of policy charges from smc s closed blocks of universal life business which were sold to giac through a reinsurance contract effective january  fees from separate accounts 
fees from separate accounts increased  or to  for from  for this increase is due primarily to an increase in the value of assets held in separate accounts from  at december  to  at december  and to higher service fees being levied on certain transactions 
net deposits from sales of unit linked products by standard management international were  and  for and  respectively 
such income fluctuates in relationship to total separate account assets and the return earned on such assets 
other income 
other income increased  or to  for compared to  for the increase resulted primarily from administration fees of  and the reserve and experience refund adjustments in connection with the agreements with giac and increased commissions received by standard marketing from the sale of unaffiliated products 
benefits and claims 
benefits and claims increased  or to  for from  for the increase resulted primarily from an increase in reserves of  related to the termination and recapture of a reinsurance agreement with national mutual 
throughout smc s history  it has experienced both periods of higher and lower benefit claims 
such volatility is not uncommon in the life insurance industry and  over extended periods of time  periods of higher claims experience tend to be offset by periods of lower claims experience 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products was  for  an increase of  or from  for the increase resulted primarily from smc s increase of credited interest rates on new annuity sales and the increases in the growth in policy reserves for fpdas from sales and the inclusion of shelby life in the operations results effective november  at december   the weighted average interest credited rate for standard life s annuities and other financial product liabilities was compared to at december  salaries and wages 
salaries and wages were  for  an increase of  or from  for this increase was caused primarily by an increase in incentive compensation expense of  amortization 
amortization expense increased  or to  for from  for the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge and increased surrenders and their corresponding increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  and from an increase of  for the amortization of present value of future profits for the acquisitions of dixie national life  shelby life and national mutual 
these items more than offset reduced amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired of  and present value of future profits of  due to the sale of first international 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased  or to  for from  for the increase in other operating expenses resulted primarily from the expenses of dixie national life and shelby life included in the results for the periods after october  and november   respectively and the increased expenses related to potential acquisitions and advisory fees 
interest expense and financing costs 
interest expense and financing costs increased  or to  for from  for the increase in interest expense and financing costs during resulted primarily from the borrowing on the amended credit agreement 
the borrowing under the amended credit agreement and the original credit agreement primarily occurred after december  in connection with the acquisition of shelby life and the repurchase of common stock and class s preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources standard management is a financial services holding company 
the liquidity requirements of standard management are met primarily from management fees  equipment rental fees and payments for other charges and dividends and interest on surplus debentures received from standard management s subsidiaries as well as standard management s working capital 
these are standard management s primary source of funds to pay operating expenses and meet debt service obligations 
the payment of dividends and interest on surplus debentures and management and other fees by standard life to standard management is subject to restrictions under the insurance laws of indiana  standard life s jurisdiction of domicile 
these internal sources of liquidity have been supplemented in the past by external sources such as lines of credit and revolving credit agreements and long term debt and equity financing in the capital markets 
smc reported on a consolidated gaap basis net cash provided by operations of  and  for and  respectively 
although deposits received on smc s interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not included in cash flow from operations under gaap  such funds are available for use by smc 
cash provided by operations plus net deposits received  less net account balances returned to policyholders on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products  resulted in positive cash flow of  and  for and  respectively 
cash generated on a consolidated basis is available to standard management only to the extent that it is generated at standard management level or is available to standard management through dividends  interest  management fees or other payments from subsidiaries 
in april  standard management instituted a program to repurchase smc common stock from time to time 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to enhance shareholder value 
standard management had repurchased  shares of smc common stock for  as of january  of the repurchases   shares were paid for through additional borrowings under the amended credit agreement   shares from the proceeds of the additional borrowings of the subordinated convertible notes  and the remainder were paid from working capital 
at january   standard management was authorized to purchase an additional  shares under this program 
at february   standard management had parent company only cash and short term investments of  these funds are available to standard management for general corporate purposes 
standard management s parent company only operating expenses not including interest expense were  and  for and  respectively 
pursuant to the management services agreement with standard management  standard life paid standard management a monthly fee of  annual fee of  during for certain management services related to the production of business  investment of assets and evaluation of acquisitions 
pursuant to the management service agreements with standard life  dixie national life paid monthly payments of  annual fee of  to standard life in both of these agreements provide that they may be modified or terminated by the indiana and mississippi departments of insurance in the event of financial hardship of standard life or dixie national life 
a management services agreement between smc and savers life was approved by the north carolina department of insurance on march  the management services agreement calls for the payment of  per month by savers life to smc for financial and regulatory reporting  investment of assets and the production of business 
smc has agreed to receive no fee  nor shall savers life have an obligation to pay  unless the capital and surplus of savers life is  after the acquisition of savers life 
the amount of capital and surplus of savers life at december  was  in addition  as a condition of the acquisition of savers life  smc entered into an agreement with the north carolina department of insurance to maintain statutory capital and surplus of savers life of at least  pursuant to the management services agreement with standard management  premier life luxembourg paid standard management a management fee of  per quarter during and for certain management and administrative services 
the agreement provides that it may be modified or terminated by either standard management or premier life luxembourg 
at april   standard management sold its property and equipment to an unaffiliated leasing financing company for  and subsequently entered into a capital lease obligation whereby standard management pays a monthly rental amount of  standard management charges a monthly equipment rental fee to its subsidiaries for this equipment and additional equipment purchased after april  the amount of the rental fee income received from standard management s subsidiaries was  and  for and  respectively 
on november   standard life acquired through merger shelby life from dlac for approximately  including  in cash   shares of restricted smc common stock valued at  and  of acquisition costs 
financing for the shelby life transaction was provided by senior debt of  under the amended credit agreement and  in subordinated convertible debt described below 
the amended credit agreement permits standard management to borrow up to  in the form of a seven year reducing revolving loan arrangement 
standard management has agreed to pay a non use fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the commitment 
in connection with the original and amended credit agreement  standard management issued warrants to the bank to purchase  shares of smc common stock 
borrowing under the amended credit agreement may be used for contributions to surplus of insurance subsidiaries  acquisition financing  and repurchases of class s preferred and smc common stock 
the debt is secured by a pledge agreement of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of standard life and standard marketing 
interest on the borrowing under the amended credit agreement is determined  at the option of standard management  to be i a fluctuating rate of interest based on corporate base rate announced by the bank from time to time plus per annum  or ii a rate at libor plus 
annual principal repayments of  begin in march and conclude in march indebtedness incurred under the amended credit agreement is subject to certain restrictions and covenants including  among other things  certain minimum financial ratios  minimum statutory surplus requirements for the insurance subsidiaries  minimum consolidated equity requirements for standard management and certain investment and indebtedness limitations 
at december   standard management had borrowed  under the amended credit agreement at a weighted average interest rate of in connection with the acquisition of shelby life  standard management borrowed  from an insurance company pursuant to a subordinated convertible debt agreement which is due in december  at june   this subordinated convertible debt agreement was amended to the principal amount of  which is due july unless previously converted  and requires interest payments in cash on january and july of each year at per annum 
at june   smc borrowed an additional  from an insurance company pursuant to another subordinated convertible debt agreement collectively  the notes which is due july unless previously converted  and requires interest payments in cash on january and july of each year at per annum 
proceeds from the additional borrowings were used for contributions to surplus of insurance subsidiaries of  redemption of class s preferred stock of approximately  and other general corporate purposes 
the notes are convertible at any time at the option of the noteholders into common stock at the rate of per share 
the notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at the option of smc commencing on july  at redemption prices equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest and declining to of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes may be prepaid prior to july  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest under certain limited circumstances 
the subordinated convertible debt agreements contains terms and financial covenants substantially similar to those in the amended credit agreement 
assuming the current level of debt under the amended credit agreement and current interest rates at december  weighted average rate of  annual debt service in would be approximately  in interest paid 
in addition  standard management has obligations under a capital lease of from the funds borrowed by standard management pursuant to the amended credit agreement and the subordinated convertible debt agreement   was loaned to standard life pursuant to an unsecured surplus debenture agreement surplus debenture which requires standard life to make quarterly interest payments to standard management at a variable corporate base rate plus per annum  and annual principal payments of  per year beginning in and concluding in the interest and principal payments are subject to quarterly approval by the indiana department of insurance  depending upon satisfaction of certain financial tests relating to levels of standard life s capital and surplus and general approval of the commissioner of the indiana department of insurance 
standard management currently anticipates these quarterly approvals will be granted 
assuming the approvals are granted and the december  interest rate of continues in  standard management will receive interest income of  from the surplus debenture for dividends from standard life to standard management are limited by laws applicable to insurance companies 
as an indiana domiciled insurance company  standard life may pay a dividend or distribution from its surplus profits  without the prior approval of the commissioner of the indiana department of insurance  if the dividend or distribution  together with all other dividends and distributions paid within the preceding twelve months  does not exceed the greater of i net gain from operations or ii of surplus  in each case as shown in its preceding annual statutory financial statements 
also  regulatory approval is required when dividends to be paid exceed unassigned statutory surplus 
for the year ended december   standard life reported statutory net gain from operations before realized capital losses of  and statutory surplus of  which includes unassigned surplus of  during  standard life can pay dividends of approximately  without regulatory approval 
as a north carolina domiciled insurance company  savers life may pay a dividend or distribution from its capital and surplus  without the prior approval of the north carolina commissioner of insurance  if the dividend or distribution together with all other dividends and distributions paid within the preceding twelve months  does not exceed the lesser of i net gain from operations or ii of capital and surplus  in each case as shown in its preceding annual statutory financial statements 
savers life was not allowed to pay a dividend in or without prior north carolina department of insurance approval due to its statutory net losses in and savers life will not be permitted to pay dividends in without such approval 
standard management anticipates the available cash from its existing working capital  plus anticipated dividends  management fees  rental income and interest payments on its surplus debentures receivable will be more than adequate to meet its anticipated parent company only cash requirements for standard management has a note receivable of  from an affiliate and a note payable of  to a different affiliate 
this note receivable and note payable are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
us insurance operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  dividend  rent  management fee and surplus debenture payments to standard management and other operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of fpdas
