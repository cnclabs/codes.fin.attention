impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenant s sales volumes and or increases in the consumer price index 
management expects that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in increases in rent over time 
however  during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
over of the properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases in which the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses 
these features in the leases reduce the company s exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on the tenants if increases in the tenant s operating expenses exceed increases in revenue
