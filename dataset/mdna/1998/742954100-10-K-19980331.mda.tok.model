see liquidity and capital resources 
paid losses and loss adjustment expenses for were million less than in primarily due to the effect of tort reform legislation enacted in michigan during a pre suit notification procedure enacted as part of such tort reform legislation has enabled the company to investigate and resolve many claims in a less expensive manner 
since the adoption of such legislation  the company has been able to utilize its internal claims management staff to a greater extent 
in the years prior to the adoption of such legislation  the company had utilized  to a greater degree  more expensive outside legal counsel to investigate and resolve claims 
in addition  paid losses and loss adjustment expenses were significantly higher in due to the high number of claims filed in just prior to the effective date of such tort reform legislation

this one time reclassification increased stockholders equity by  net of deferred federal income taxes  as of december  all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value as of december  and the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive to interest rate changes 
as of december  and  the fixed maturity portfolio had net unrealized gains of approximately million and  respectively 
the increase in net unrealized gains was due to slightly lower interest rates at year end compared to year end as of december   the fixed maturity portfolio had a weighted average modified duration of approximately four years

during and  the company continued to balance its need for rate adjustments with the goal of maintaining market share in very competitive environments in michigan  illinois  indiana and ohio 
although the company has maintained profitability and is endeavoring to offset lower premiums charged through more selective underwriting practices  there can be no assurance that these practices will be successful in the long run

estimating professional liability reserves is a complex process which is heavily dependent on judgment and involves many uncertainties 
as a result  reserve estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
it has been the practice of the company to establish its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves conservatively  as it relates to immaturely developed accident years  to minimize potential uncertainties 
nevertheless  the company s reserves have been established within the range of acceptable values estimated by the company s consulting actuary and are recorded based on such actuarial estimates 
the assumptions used in establishing the company s reserves are regularly reviewed by management and revised as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are generally reflected in current operations 
professional liability insurance incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses including the increase in reserve for extended reporting period claims for totaled million  a decrease of  as compared to professional liability insurance incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of million for as a percentage of premiums earned  the professional liability insurance incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio including the increase in reserve for extended reporting period claims improved slightly to in  as compared to in the company has continued to employ more selective underwriting practices during this time of highly competitive market conditions 
accordingly  the professional liability incurred loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has remained stable 
there can be no assurances  however  that these selective underwriting practices will be successful in the long run

the company recorded million in federal income tax expense in as compared to million in the company s effective federal income tax rate approximated in compared to in the slight increase in the effective income tax rate is due mainly to certain merger and acquisition expenses which are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
net income for was million  or per share assuming dilution  on revenues of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per share assuming dilution  on revenues of million in the favorable earnings were attributable to the factors described above 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  professional liability net premiums written were million in  an increase of when compared to professional liability net premiums written of million in the increase in professional liability net premiums written was primarily due to million in additional net premiums written by the company s expansion of business into indiana and ohio 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in professional liability premiums in the company s michigan and illinois insurance markets 
during and  the company continued to balance its need for rate adjustments with the goal of maintaining market share in very competitive environments in michigan  illinois  indiana and ohio 
although the company has maintained profitability and is endeavoring to offset lower premiums charged through more selective underwriting practices  there can be no assurance that these practices will be successful in the long run 
net investment income  excluding realized capital gains and losses  was million for  an increase of over net investment income of million for net investment income increased  despite a significant shift in the company s investment portfolio towards municipal bonds which  due to their tax exempt status  offer lower pre tax yields  due principally to the increases in invested assets associated with positive cash flows from operations 
the weighted average tax equivalent book yield of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was and as of december  and  respectively

the factors leading to such favorable development were i the company s practice of establishing its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves conservatively  as it relates to immaturely developed accident years  to minimize potential uncertainties  and ii lower than expected claims costs associated in part with tort reform legislation enacted in michigan between and such tort reform legislation shortened the statute of limitations  introduced a statute of repose with a six year limitation for adults  modified expert witness rules to require more qualified expert witnesses and capped non economic damages 
at year end  the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were discounted using a three percent interest rate assumption 
effective january   the practice of discounting reserves for financial reporting was eliminated and  accordingly  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves have been established on an undiscounted basis thereafter a more conservative accounting practice used by most publicly traded insurance companies 
policy acquisition and underwriting expenses were million in  a increase over policy acquisition and underwriting expenses of million in as a percentage of premiums earned  the underwriting expense ratio was in  up from the underwriting expense ratio of in the increase in such expenses in relative to is attributable to non recurring legal  accounting and related expenses associated with the formation of the professionals group holding company system  a one time stock bonus paid to directors  officers and employees in and start up expenses associated with the company s expansion of business into indiana and ohio 
the company recorded million in federal income tax expense in as compared to million in the company s effective federal income tax rate approximated in compared to in the decrease in the effective income tax rate is due to the company s increased holdings in tax exempt municipal bonds which caused a million or decrease in the expense and effective rate  respectively  as well as a revision to the estimate of the prior years tax liability which caused a  or decrease in the expense and effective rate  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by adjustments for other items  including dividends received deductions and non deductible meals and entertainment  respectively  in an aggregate amount of  or of the effective rate 
the prior years tax liability adjustment related to an overestimated tax accrual that was revised with the federal tax return filing 
net income for was million  or per share assuming dilution  on revenues of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per share assuming dilution  on revenues of million in the favorable earnings were attributable to the factors described above 
net income for was reduced by million net of deferred federal income taxes  or per share assuming dilution  as a result of a cumulative effect change in accounting method associated with the elimination of the company s practice of discounting its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves during liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of continuing operations 
liquidity  in the context of insurance operations  is typically determined by two distinct operations underwriting and investing 
net cash flows from underwriting operations are used to build an investment portfolio  which in turn produces future cash from investment income 
the company continuously monitors available cash and short term investment balances in relation to projected cash needs to maintain adequate balances for current payments while maximizing cash available for longer term investment opportunities 
the payment of losses  loss adjustment expenses and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business represents the company s principal need for liquid funds 
payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year 
payments for reinsurance are made within thirty days subsequent to the end of each quarter  with adjustments made after each reinsurance year 
historically  cash used to pay for these items has been provided by operations 
in  the company used a portion of its cash flow from operations to fund its purchase of a new home office facility  including furniture and equipment  for million 
as of december   no material commitments for capital expenditures existed  and management believes the company s present liquidity  together with its expected cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund any future potential commitments for capital expenditures 
the ability of professionals group to fund its operations and to pay dividends on its common stock will be dependent upon its receipt of dividends  loans or advances from its insurance company subsidiaries particularly picom 
the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions 
generally  these restrictions limit the amount of dividends such subsidiaries can pay to their respective parent in any month period to the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year excluding realized gains and losses on sales of investments  or ten percent of policyholders surplus as of the end of the preceding year 
as of january   approximately million of dividends could be paid by professionals group s direct insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
in and  professionals group s insurance subsidiaries paid cash dividends aggregating million and million  respectively  to professionals group 
none of professionals group s insurance subsidiaries paid any cash dividends in there can be no assurance as to any future dividends by professionals group or any of its subsidiaries see also note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  professionals group borrowed million under a seven year unsecured bank term loan  bearing interest at an adjustable rate of libor plus basis points the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  interest  which accrued at the rate of per annum as of december   is payable quarterly and principal is payable in installments on april of each year as follows   and  professionals group used million of the proceeds of this loan to make a capital contribution to picom  which in turn  used the proceeds to purchase a million surplus note from meemic 
the credit agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends on professionals group s common stock except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares related to stock dividends declared 
it also required the company to  among other things  maintain total consolidated stockholders equity of at least million plus of the preceding fiscal year s consolidated net income  maintain a ratio of debt to equity of not more than and maintain a fixed charges coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of not less than and  respectively 
the company was in compliance with  or has received waivers of  all required covenants at december  in april  the company completed certain transactions with meemic involving the company s purchase of a twelve year  million surplus note from meemic  bearing interest at per annum the meemic surplus note and its reinsuring  on a quota share basis  of meemic s net premiums beginning july  in connection with these transactions i the company agreed to provide meemic with information systems services and certain consulting services under a management services agreement for a base fee of million  ii professionals group nominees were elected to all positions on the board of directors of meemic  and iii the company agreed to assist meemic in acquiring the net assets of michigan educators insurance agency  inc meia  the exclusive distributor of meemic insurance products 
on september   meemic insurance services corporation meemic services corp  a newly formed subsidiary of meemic  purchased the net assets of meia 
the purchase price equaled of premiums written by meemic services corp 
through july  subject to a guaranteed minimum purchase price of million 
to fund this purchase  meemic services corp 
paid cash of million utilizing the proceeds of the meemic surplus note  and agreed to pay million to meia as additional consideration through  as provided for in the purchase agreement 
meemic guaranteed payment of the first million and professionals group guaranteed payment of the final million payable in years of such additional consideration 
the company believes the likelihood that the guarantee would become payable is minimal 
the company assisted meemic in meemic s acquisition of the net assets of meia for the reasons that follow the company believes that by virtue of such acquisition  meemic acquired greater control over the distribution and pricing of its insurance products 
the company anticipates that such control will enable meemic to increase the volume of its insurance business 
given the terms of the company s reinsurance agreement with meemic  an increase in the volume of meemic s insurance business will increase the amounts of insurance and insurance premiums ceded to picom 
at a future date  the company and meemic expect to pursue demutualization of meemic 
such demutualization would be subject to regulatory approval by the michigan commissioner of insurance and approval by meemic s policyholders 
no specific timetable has been set for demutualization and there can be no assurances that meemic will be demutualized 
on august   professionals group announced a definitive agreement to merge picom with physicians protective trust fund 
the terms of such merger  which were amended and restated on october  pursuant to a first amended and restated agreement and plan of merger dated as of october  by and among professionals group  picom and pptf the merger agreement  contemplate the combining of the operations of picom and pptf  through the conversion  subject to dissenters rights  of all membership rights of members of pptf into an aggregate of  shares of common stock of professionals group 
the contemplated merger is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests which means professionals group will carry forward to its accounts the assets and liabilities of pptf at the respective amounts reported by pptf and is expected to occur in the second quarter of  subject to regulatory and stockholder policyholder approval 
professionals group was incorporated in january for the purpose of serving as the holding company for picom and its subsidiaries 
effective august   professionals group acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of picom common stock through the merger of a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary of professionals group with and into picom the reorganization 
by virtue of the reorganization  each issued and outstanding share of picom common stock was converted into one share of common stock  no par value per share  of professionals group and picom became a wholly owned subsidiary of professionals group 
in may  and in a transaction valued at approximately million  picom acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of american insurance management corporation  a privately held indiana corporation that serves as the attorney in fact for american medical insurance exchange  an inactive indiana interinsurance reciprocal exchange 
while the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  the effect of the acquisition was not material to the company s consolidated results of operations see also note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
on july   picom repurchased  shares of its common stock approximately of the then issued and outstanding shares of picom common stock owned by physicians insurance company of ohio at a price of per share 
during  picom negotiated a reciprocal stock purchase agreement with physicians insurance company of wisconsin  inc pic wis 
under the agreement  picom acquired  shares of pic wis common stock representing of the then outstanding shares of pic wis common stock for million and pic wis purchased  shares of picom common stock representing of the then issued and outstanding shares of picom common stock for million 
the transaction replaced more than one half of the equity used to accomplish the previously reported repurchase of shares of picom common stock held by physicians insurance company of ohio 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the cost of paying losses and loss adjustment expenses 
moreover  increases in market interest rates  which often occur during periods of high inflation  reduce the fair value of the company s fixed maturity securities 
conversely  reductions in market interest rates increase the fair value of fixed maturity securities 
inflation increases the costs of settling insurance claims over time 
because insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known  the company attempts to anticipate the future impact of inflation when establishing rate levels 
the company may be limited in raising its premium levels for competitive and regulatory reasons  in which case the company  rather than its insureds  would be required to absorb the effects of inflation 
future economic changes which result in prolonged and increasing levels of inflation could cause increases in the dollar amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and thereby adversely affect future reserve development 
to minimize such risk  the company maintains what management considers to be strong and adequate reinsurance  conducts regular actuarial reviews of reserves and maintains adequate asset liquidity 
reinsurance in the normal course of business  the company seeks to reduce the loss that may arise from events that cause unfavorable underwriting results  provide additional capacity for growth and protect stockholders equity by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
at the present time  the company has both excess of loss reinsurance and errors and omissions insurance 
although reinsurance agreements contractually obligate the company s reinsurers to reimburse the company for their proportionate share of losses  they do not discharge the primary liability of the company 
the company is contingently liable for the ceded amount of reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums in the event the assuming insurance organizations are unable to meet their contractual obligations
