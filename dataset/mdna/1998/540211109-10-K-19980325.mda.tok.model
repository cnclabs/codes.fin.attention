seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors 
typically  occupancy rates are higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has incurred operating and net losses due in large part to the depreciation  amortization and interest expenses related to the capital required to expand its lodging and residential businesses 
the growth of the company s business requires substantial indebtedness to finance expansion of its lodging and multi family residential businesses 
the company expects that losses will increase as the company implements its expansion strategy 
historically  cash flow from operations has not been sufficient to fund the cost of expanding the company s business and to service existing indebtedness 
capital expenditures were approximately million during  and net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
depending on the rate of growth of its lodging and residential businesses and other factors  the company expects to incur capital expenditures of between approximately to million in and substantial amounts thereafter 
the actual amount and timing of the company s capital expenditures will vary and such variations could page be material depending upon the number of new contracts for services entered into by the company  the costs of installations and other factors 
this a forward looking statement and there can be no assurance in this regard 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility limits the amount of the company s annual capital expenditures to a certain base amount plus the amounts of certain additional financing 
the company believes that its operating cash flows and borrowings permitted under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements for to months  and  the company may increase the revolving credit facility from its present to million  subject to certain conditions 
however  this is a forward looking statement and there can be no assurance in this regard 
resnet  under its various agreements with tsat  may call upon tsat to contribute up to million of additional capital to resnet  which proceeds must be used for the purchase of satellite receiving equipment 
for additional information concerning the terms of the company s long term debt and revolving credit facility  please see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the company believes that it has various sources of financing available in addition to borrowings under the revolving credit facility  including additional amounts of long term indebtedness 
however  if the company s plans or assumptions change  if its assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if the company experiences unanticipated costs or competitive pressures  the company may be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing  or  if such financing is available  that the company will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain additional financing  if needed  could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s expansion plans 
resnet is currently at a stage of development during which it will consume  through operating losses and capital expenditures for installations  substantially more capital than it is capable of generating 
the company is currently assessing alternative strategies to reduce the negative financial impact of the operating losses and capital requirements of resnet during its growth phase 
year information the company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its computer systems and software in regard to year issues 
based on its review  the company does not anticipate any material costs or expenses  or any material adverse effect on its operations  financial condition  products or services  or competitive position as a result of such issues 
the company is cooperating with its customers and suppliers to assess the extent  if any  of year issues pertaining to such third party computer systems
