for a description of the transactions completed by the company during and to date in  see business recent developments transactions completed since january  set forth in part i item herein 
in the following analysis  management discusses the company s broadcast cash flow 
the performance of a radio station group is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the two components of broadcast cash flow are gross revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expense and non cash and non recurring charges 
the primary source of revenues is the sale of broadcasting time for advertising 
the company s most significant operating expenses for purposes of the computation of broadcast cash flow are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  and advertising and promotion expenses 
the company strives to control these expenses by working closely with local station management 
the company s revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the company s first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenues  and the fourth quarter generally produces the highest revenues 
although broadcast cash flow is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company believes that it is widely used as a measure of operating performance 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
broadcast cash flow does not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  broadcast cash flow is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in the company s business or other discretionary uses
