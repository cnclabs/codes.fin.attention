costs of company owned restaurant sales and minority interest in earnings of restaurant partnerships relate directly to company owned restaurant sales 
other expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  and general and administrative expenses  relate to both company owned restaurant operations  as well as the company s franchising operations 
the company s revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of company owned restaurants 
the company s revenues and  to a lesser extent  expenses are also affected by the number and sales volumes of franchised restaurants 
initial franchise fees are directly affected by the number of franchised restaurant openings

comparison of fiscal to fiscal total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal company owned restaurant sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million increase in company owned restaurant sales  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal average sales increases of approximately by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal and fiscal accounted for million of the increase 
franchise fee revenues increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal  primarily resulting from the opening of new franchise restaurants in fiscal compared to in fiscal franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increased sales by comparable franchised restaurants resulted in an increase in royalties of approximately million and resulted from the franchise same store sales growth of over fiscal additional franchise restaurants in operation resulted in an increase in royalties of million 
the decrease in other revenues of approximately million resulted primarily from the fiscal year gain on the sale of the company s minority interest in restaurants 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the reported decline in operating margins resulted primarily from the company s adoption of a new accounting standard  sop  which requires that pre opening and other start up costs be expensed as incurred 
the company previously capitalized such costs and amortized them over months 
implementation of the standard resulted in the reclassification of expenses from depreciation and amortization into restaurant cost of operations 
the following table sets out the pro forma operating margins for fiscal and as if the company had adopted the new standard as of the beginning of fiscal year ended august  august  pro forma margin analysis company owned restaurants food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits other operating expenses the following discussion is based on the pro forma margin analysis 
management believes the decrease in food and packaging costs resulted from the negotiation of more favorable contracts with suppliers  a reduction in promotional discounting from standard menu prices and a continued shift in product mix toward higher margin items such as drinks and ice cream 
the increase in payroll and other employee benefit costs resulted primarily from an increase in the hourly wage rate related to a minimum wage increase which was effective september  without a corresponding increase in pricing 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted primarily from increased marketing expenditures  which reflects the company s commitment to increased media penetration through its system of advertising cooperatives 
minority interest in earnings of restaurant partnerships decreased  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to in fiscal versus in fiscal this decrease reflected the minority partners share of depreciation expense associated with the roll out of a point of sale system 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to decline in future periods  as a percentage of total revenues  because the company plans to add fewer corporate employees  as a percentage of the existing corporate employee base  than in previous periods 
this strategy is expected to result in revenues growing at a higher rate than selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million due to the purchase of buildings and equipment for new restaurants  retrofit expenditures for existing restaurants  and information systems upgrades 
management expects this trend to continue due to a similar level of capital expenditures planned for fiscal the company recorded a million special provision for litigation settlement in the third fiscal quarter of as a result of the denial by the supreme court of the state of texas of the company s appeal of a decision by the texas court of appeals in a real estate related lawsuit that has been ongoing for several years 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income from operations increased to million from million in fiscal excluding the special provision for litigation settlement discussed above  income from operations increased to million 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was the result of additional borrowings to partially fund the company s capital additions of million and stock repurchases of million 
the company expects interest expense to continue to increase in fiscal provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal and net income  excluding the special provision for litigation settlement and before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for pre opening costs  increased 
net income per diluted share increased over fiscal  excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change and the special provision for litigation settlement 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal company owned restaurant sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million increase in company owned restaurant sales  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal average sales increases of approximately by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal and fiscal accounted for million of the increase 
franchise fee revenues increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal  primarily resulting from the opening of new franchise restaurants in fiscal vs 
in fiscal franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increased sales by comparable franchised restaurants resulted in an increase in royalties of approximately million and resulted from the franchise same store sales growth of over fiscal additional franchise restaurants in operation resulted in an increase in royalties of million 
the decrease in other revenues was due to the sale of the restaurant equipment division in fiscal this decrease was offset by the gain on the sale of the company s minority interest in restaurants 
the sale of these interests is not expected to have a material impact on income in the future 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal management believes the improvement in restaurant operating margins resulted from a average price increase implemented october   along with a average price increase implemented during the second quarter of fiscal  reductions in food and packaging costs due to consolidation of purchasing distribution functions and renegotiation of pricing terms  and improved operational cost controls through the implementation of a standard ideal food cost program in fiscal the improvements mentioned above were partially offset by a minimum wage increase which was effective on october   and an increase in marketing expenditures  which reflects the company s commitment to increased media penetration through its system of advertising cooperatives 
another minimum wage increase became effective september  and had a negative impact on payroll and employee benefits expense of approximately one percentage point  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales 
minority interest in earnings of restaurant partnerships increased  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase occurred primarily due to the improvements in operating margins discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from a provision for expected litigation costs of approximately million recorded in fiscal management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to decline in future periods  as a percentage of total revenues  because the company expects a significant portion of future revenue growth to be attributable to company owned restaurants 
company owned restaurants require a lower level of selling  general and administrative expenses than the company s franchising operations since most of these expenses are reflected in restaurant cost of operations and minority interest in restaurant operations 
many of the managers and supervisors of company owned restaurants own a minority interest in the restaurants  and their compensation flows through the minority interest in earnings of restaurant partnerships 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million due to the purchase of buildings and equipment for new and existing restaurants and information systems upgrades 
management expects this trend to continue due to increased capital expenditures planned for fiscal income from operations increased to million from million in fiscal excluding the provision for adoption of a new accounting standard recorded in fiscal  income from operations increased 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was the result of additional borrowings to partially fund the company s capital additions of million and stock repurchases of million 
provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal  compared to for the comparable period in fiscal net income for the period increased to million and earnings per diluted share increased to  excluding the after tax effect of the provision for adoption of a new accounting standard recorded in fiscal liquidity and sources of capital during fiscal  the company opened new restaurants and sold restaurants to franchisees 
the company funded total capital additions for fiscal of million  which included the cost of newly opened restaurants  restaurants under construction  retrofits of existing restaurants  new equipment for existing restaurants and corporate use  internally from cash generated by operating activities and through borrowings under the company s line of credit 
during fiscal  the company elected to own the real estate on of the newly constructed restaurants 
the company expects to own the land and building for approximately of its future company owned newly constructed restaurants 
in addition to the capital expenditures mentioned above  the company repurchased  shares as adjusted for the stock split of common stock for approximately million during fiscal the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides the company with a million line of credit expiring in july the company will use the line of credit to finance the opening of newly constructed restaurants  retrofit of existing restaurants  acquisitions of existing restaurants  and for other general corporate purposes to the extent such cash requirements exceed cash provided by operations 
as of august   the company s outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were million  exclusive of million in outstanding letters of credit 
the available line of credit on this facility as of august   was million 
additionally  the company completed a private placement of million in senior unsecured notes on april  these notes consist of million of series a notes which mature in  and million of series b notes which mature in interest on the notes will be payable semi annually in arrears at an average annual rate of approximately 
the company used the proceeds from the notes to pay down the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit discussed above  to repurchase common stock of the company and for general corporate purposes 
the company plans for capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  excluding potential acquisitions 
these capital expenditures are primarily for the development of additional company owned stores  retrofit of company owned stores and enhancements to existing financial and operating information systems 
in addition to the planned capital expenditures  the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of additional shares of the company s common stock 
the company expects to fund these capital expenditures and share repurchases through borrowings under its existing unsecured revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations 
the company believes that existing cash and funds generated from internal operations  as well as borrowings under the line of credit  will be sufficient to meet the company s needs for the foreseeable future 
year description 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded computer chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations which could disrupt the company s normal business activities 
the company has established a plan to prepare its systems for the year issue as well as to reasonably assure that its critical business partners are prepared 
the phases of the company s plan to resolve the year issue involve awareness  assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has completed its assessment of all internal systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue 
based upon its assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software primarily related to customized interfaces between its financial systems and other applications 
the company believes that with modifications or replacements of the identified software programs  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if all additional phases of the year plan are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company as set forth under risks and contingency plans 
in addition  the company is in the process of gathering information about the year compliance status of its key third party business partners 
status 
the company s internal information technology exposures are primarily related to financial and management information systems 
as of october   the company is complete on the remediation phase and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than february  once the software is reprogrammed or replaced with a year compliant version  the company will test and implement the software 
as of october   the company had completed of its testing and had implemented of its remediated applications 
completion of the testing phase for all significant systems is expected by june  with all remediated systems fully tested and implemented by september  the company s non information technology systems consist primarily of restaurant operating equipment including its point of sale systems 
the initial assessment of these systems has indicated that modification or replacement will not be necessary as a result of the year issue 
as such  the company is not currently remediating this operating equipment 
however  the existence of embedded technology is by nature more difficult to identify 
while the company believes that all significant non information technology systems are year compliant  the company plans to continue testing its operating equipment and expects to complete the testing by march  significant third parties 
the company s significant third party business partners consist of suppliers  banks  and its franchisees 
the company does not have any significant system interfaces with third parties 
an initial inventory of significant suppliers and distributors has been completed and letters mailed requesting information regarding each parties year compliance status 
additionally  the company has identified approximately key suppliers and distributors which it intends to meet with and discuss their year readiness 
the company intends to develop contingency plans by march  for suppliers that appear to have substantial year operational risks which may include the change of suppliers to minimize such risks 
letters will be sent to all relationship banks by december  requesting an update on their year compliance status 
review and evaluation of responses will be conducted through june  no later than september   the company will discontinue relationships with banks that indicate compliance with year has not been achieved 
a year information manual has been sent to all franchisees explaining the year issue and associated business risks 
this manual provided information and tools to assist the franchisees in assessing their year risks 
the company will continue its efforts to raise awareness and inform franchisees of the risks posed by the year throughout fiscal year costs 
the company s year plan encompasses the use of both internal and external resources to identify  remediate  test  and implement systems for year readiness 
external resources include contract resources which will be used to supplement available internal resources 
the total cost of the year project  excluding internal personnel costs  is estimated at  and is being funded by operating cash flows 
as of august   the company had incurred approximately  which has all been expensed  related to the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  is attributable to the purchase and implementation of new software and will be capitalized 
the remaining  relates to remediation and testing of software and will be expensed as incurred 
risks and contingency plans 
management of the company believes it has an effective plan in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
however  due to the forward looking nature and lack of historical experience with year issues  it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen after december  despite the year remediation efforts being made  it is likely that there will be disruptions and unexpected business problems during the early months of the company plans to make diligent efforts to assess the year readiness of its significant business partners and will develop contingency plans for critical areas where it believes its exposure to year risk is the greatest 
however  despite the company s efforts  it may encounter unanticipated third party failures  more general public infrastructure failures or a failure to successfully conclude its remediation efforts as planned 
if the remaining year plan is not completed timely  in addition to the implications noted above  the company may be required to utilize manual processing of certain otherwise automated processes primarily related to partner compensation and cash management 
any one of these unforeseen events could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows in and beyond 
additionally  the inability of franchisees to remit royalty payments on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the amount of potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of its senior notes and outstanding line of credit 
the senior notes bear interest at fixed rates which average 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of august  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
as of august   the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was million as of august  the impact on the company s results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balances under the senior notes and line of credit as of august  would be immaterial 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken  and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets 
impact of inflation though increases in labor  food  or other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations  management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
during fiscal year  however  company owned restaurants increased prices due primarily to higher labor costs resulting from increases in the federal minimum wage 
seasonality the company does not expect seasonality to affect its operations in a materially adverse manner 
the company s results during its second quarter  comprising the months of december  january  and february  will generally be lower than its other quarters due to the climate of the locations of a number of its restaurants
