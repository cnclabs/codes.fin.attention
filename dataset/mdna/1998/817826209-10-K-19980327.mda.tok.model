item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some of the matters discussed in this annual report contain forward looking statements regarding the company s future business which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and government regulations 
these issues  and other factors which may be identified from time to time in the company s reports filed with the sec  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements

net earnings per common share diluted 


the decline in the company s net earnings from the prior year resulted from start up costs associated with its strategic initiatives  higher per store labor expense  lower gas gross profits and a benefit from an irs tax settlement in merchandise sales growth over the last half of offset a portion of these factors 
management strategies since  the company has been committed to several key strategies that it believes  over the long term  will provide further differentiation from competitors and allow eleven to maintain its position as the premier convenience retailer 
these strategies include upgrading the store base  a customer driven approach to product selection  an everyday fair pricing policy on all items  daily delivery of fresh perishable items  introduction of high quality  ready to eat fresh foods  and the implementation of a state of the art retail information system 
prior to  the company focused on upgrading its store base  through remodeling existing stores and closing underachieving stores 
in late  the company completed the most extensive remodeling program in its history 
future upgrade programs will focus on retail information systems  food service and other merchandising programs 
beginning in late and throughout  the company began to focus its efforts on opening or acquiring new stores 
the company s ten year decline in operating properties was slowed in and ended in with net store growth 
store openings over the last three years totaled  and in  and  respectively 
in addition  there were stores under construction at december  in  new store openings are expected to outpace closings  with the expansion occurring in existing markets to support the company s fresh food and combined distribution initiatives 
in recent years  the company has pruned its store base  closing or disposing of those stores that either could not support its strategies  were not expected to achieve an acceptable level of profitability in the future  or had leases which expired 
as a result  store closings during the past three years totaled  and in  and  respectively 
the company expects to close slightly more stores in than it has in either of the last two years  primarily due to a large number of lease expirations 
the store additions and closings discussed above include relocations  rebuilds and seasonal activity 
the customer driven approach to merchandising focuses on providing the customer an expanded selection of quality products at a good value 
this is being accomplished by emphasizing the importance of ordering at the store level  removing slow moving items and aggressively introducing new  high potential products in the early stages of their life cycle 
this process represents an ongoing effort to satisfy the ever changing preferences of our customers 
the company s everyday fair pricing strategy is designed to provide consistent prices on all items by reducing its reliance on discounting 
when the everyday fair pricing strategy was introduced  some product prices were lowered  while others were increased to achieve more consistency 
going forward  the company plans to migrate toward lower retail prices as lower product costs are achieved through contract negotiations or strategic alliances with suppliers and distributors 
daily delivery of time sensitive or perishable items along with high quality  ready to eat foods is another key management strategy 
implementation of this strategy includes third party development and operation of combined distribution centers cdc  fresh food commissaries and bakery facilities in many of the company s markets around the country 
the commissary and bakery ready to eat items  like fresh sandwiches and pastries  along with goods from multiple vendors such as dairy products  bread  produce and other perishable goods  are combined at a distribution center and delivered daily to each store 
in addition to providing fresher products  improved in stock conditions and quicker response time on new items  the combined distribution is also intended to provide lower product costs  in part from vendors savings  through this approach 
at the end of  over  stores were serviced by daily distribution facilities 
expansion of these programs to another stores is anticipated in the development of a retail information system is began in the initial phase  completed in early  involved installing in store processors isp in each store to automate accounting and other store level tasks 
the current phase involves the installation of point of sale registers with scanning capabilities  as well as tools on the isp to assist with ordering and product assortment  and a hand held unit for ordering product from the sales floor 
after completion  the system will provide each store and its suppliers and distributors with on line information to make better decisions in anticipating customer needs 
management believes that the effective utilization of daily sales data gathered by the system will improve sales through reducing out of stock incidents and enhancing each individual store s product mix to better match customers needs 
in addition  the system will assist with monitoring inventories to better control shortage and product write offs 
while implementation costs during the roll out phase are expected to exceed the short term benefits  the anticipated long term benefits of this system  coupled with further cost reductions resulting from automation  are expected to help the company reach its goal of sustained profitable growth over the long term 
this phase of the system is currently expected to be fully operational for all stores by early except where noted  all per store numbers refer to an average of all stores rather than only stores open more than one year 
sales the company recorded net sales of billion for the year ended december   compared to sales of billion in and billion in the increase in net sales in over was a result of same store merchandise sales growth  combined with an increase in stores that sold gasoline 
the net sales increase in when compared to was due to same store merchandise sales growth  combined with an increase in the sales price of gasoline 
the following table illustrates the growth in merchandise sales merchandise sales growth data per store years ended december increase decrease from prior year us same store sales growth us same store real sales growth  excluding inflation 
eleven inflation 
the last two quarters of reflected a favorable merchandise sales trend  with third quarter us same store merchandise sales growth of  followed by fourth quarter growth of  the highest such increase since the fourth quarter of the company believes that this trend is  in part  a result of changes made to the merchandising organization and its processes in the second quarter of while average per store merchandise sales growth in and was fairly consistent among the various geographical areas  category results were mixed categories driving the merchandise sales increase were coffee  slurpee  non carbonated beverages  tobacco  services  fresh bakery and roller grill products 
certain mature categories like candy and soft drinks were virtually flat  while others such as fountain drinks and bread had slight declines 
categories with significant sales improvement in included pre paid cards and services  while traditional convenience store products such as cigarettes  non alcoholic beverages and candy  which account for almost of merchandise sales  had below average growth 
during average per store merchandise sales results varied by geographic region 
the largest sales increases occurred in those areas with the highest percentage of completed remodels florida  texas colorado 
conversely  the southern california area  which included of the company s domestic stores  experienced a decline of almost due to a sluggish economy 
gasoline sales dollars per store decreased slightly in after increases of and in and  respectively 
contributing to the decrease was a 
decline in average per store gallon volume with the sales price being virtually flat to in  the increase was mostly due to the average sales price per gallon increasing almost cents per gallon over other income other income of million for was million higher than and million higher than the improvement is primarily the result of increased royalty income from licensed operations 
while some of the royalty income could be unfavorably impacted by fluctuating exchange rates  approximately of the royalties are from area license agreements with sej 
though the dollar equivalent of the sej royalty income will fluctuate with exchange rate movements  the company has effectively hedged this exposure by using the royalty income to make principal and interest payments on its yen denominated loan 
upon repayment of the yen loan  currently projected for  the royalty income will not be pledged 
thereafter  the royalties under that license agreement will again be paid to the company or may be used to collateralize other financing arrangements 
one year following such repayment  the yen denominated royalty payments from sej will be reduced by approximately two thirds in accordance with terms of the license agreement 
gross profits merchandise gross profit data years ended december merchandise gross profit dollars in millions    increase decrease from prior year all stores average per store gross profit dollar change margin percentage point change 


average per store merchandise sales total merchandise gross profit dollars increased in from both higher average per store sales and margins 
the decline in was primarily from store closings and a slightly lower margin 
the increase in merchandise margin in was primarily due to improved sales in some higher margin categories like slurpee  coffee  non carbonated beverages and services 
these increases were partially offset by higher write offs  as the company focused on expanding its fresh food program  both geographically and with new products 
more aggressive retail pricing continues to present a challenge in today s increasingly more competitive environment 
management is actively working to improve merchandise margin while providing fair and consistent prices 
cigarettes currently contribute approximately of both the company s total merchandise gross profit and total sales 
with the recent legal settlements between cigarette manufacturers and several state governments  the company anticipates that the cost of cigarettes could rise in the near future 
additionally  there are numerous examples of pending state and federal legislation aimed at reducing minors consumption of tobacco products which include significant increases in cigarette taxes 
it is impossible to predict the exact impact these potential cost increases would have on the company s gross profits  partially due to uncertainties regarding competitor reaction to the increases 
during  merchandise margin declined slightly due to three main factors rising product costs  lower than average sales growth of high margin items and higher product write offs 
in  sales of higher margin categories like pre paid phone cards and services performed well enough to offset cost increases in various other categories that could not be passed on to the consumer for competitive reasons 
gasoline gross profit data years ended december gasoline gross profit dollars in millions increase decrease from prior year average per store gross profit dollar change margin point change in cents per gallon 


average per store gas gallonage 

in  gasoline gross profits declined million from the levels achieved in excluding the stores on the west coast  the company s gasoline gross profits increased million in compared to this increase was comprised of a slight average per store gallon increase and an increase in gas store months 
the stores on the west coast of the company s total gas stores were impacted by industry product supply problems and intense competitive conditions  creating a situation where  in some cases  the company s cost exceeded other operator s retail price of gasoline 
in general  over the last two years  lower margins in cents per gallon have been created by market conditions that have kept wholesale costs high  while competitive pressures have kept retail prices in check 
in many of these situations  the company has chosen to maintain margin levels at the expense of gallonage growth 
although competitive pressures will continue  the company feels there is a chance the industry supply problems experienced over the last two years may be easing 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses osg a years ended december dollars in millions total operating  selling  general and administrative expenses    ratio of osg a to sales increase decrease in osg a compared to prior year the increase in osg a expenses  and the ratio to sales  in compared to  is primarily the result of the following factors incremental costs related to the retail information system initiatives  increase in store labor due to a tight labor market and minimum wage increases  higher depreciation expense due to the extensive remodeling program completed in late  completion of new stores and other initiatives  more environmental remediation  and higher store insurance due to the comparison with favorable claims experience reflected in osg a expenses  and the ratio to sales  declined in  when compared to  despite the incremental costs of the retail information system initiatives 
the largest item contributing to the improvement was lower insurance costs 
based upon favorable claims experience  the company lowered its insurance accruals 
other factors aiding the comparison included the absence of a significant restructuring charge compared to a charge of million in  declines in environmental remediation expenses  savings from reductions in force and lower expenses from having fewer stores 
the majority of the decrease in osg a expenses in resulted from cost savings realized from reductions in force  combined with the effect of having fewer stores see management strategies 
in december  the company accrued million for severance costs and realignment of office space 
these reductions were substantially complete in  and changes in estimates from the original accrual did not have a material impact on earnings 
the company continues to review the functions necessary to enable its stores to respond faster and more cost efficiently to rapidly changing customer needs and preferences 
in conjunction with this review  management continues to realign and reduce personnel and office facilities  in order to eliminate non essential costs  while devoting resources to the implementation of its retail information system and other strategic initiatives 
in early  the company implemented additional changes and anticipates reflecting a one time charge for severance benefits of approximately million in the first quarter of management expects future periods expenses to increase with the continued roll out of the retail information system and accordingly  the ratio to sales is anticipated to increase until the roll out is substantially complete and more related benefits are attained see management strategies 
the company is a defendant in two legal actions  which are referred to as the eleven offf and valente cases  filed by franchisees in and  respectively  asserting various claims against the company 
a nationwide settlement has recently been negotiated and  in connection with the settlement  these two cases have been combined on behalf of a class of all persons who operated eleven convenience stores in the united states at any time between january  and july   under franchise agreements with the company 
class members have until march  to opt out of the settlement  and a final hearing to approve the settlement is currently scheduled on april  the company s accruals are sufficient to cover the payment due under the settlement with no material impact upon earnings  as well as no anticipated impact on earnings 
interest expense  net net interest expense decreased slightly in compared to due to lower average borrowing throughout the year  partially offset by lower interest income due to the money order agreement 
approximately of the company s debt contains floating rates that would be unfavorably impacted by rising interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt was for versus and for and  respectively 
the company expects net interest expense in to remain relatively flat  based upon anticipated levels of debt and interest rate projections  but there will be several offsetting items impacting interest expense 
factors increasing interest expense include higher borrowings obligations to finance new store development and the redemption of the company s senior subordinated debentures debentures which currently recognize no interest expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructuring  as discussed further in the debentures section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
this redemption is being funded with convertible quarterly income debt securities convertible debt due see liquidity and capital resources 
items which will decrease interest expense include a lower interest rate on the existing yen denominated loan and higher capitalized interest 
the interest rate on the existing yen denominated loan was reset in march of  resulting in a rate reduction of basis points 
net interest expense increased million in compared to due to lower interest income  combined with higher interest expense from the convertible quarterly income debt securities convertible debt due which were issued in november and are not accounted for under sfas no 
the lower interest income was primarily the result of a new money order agreement that eliminated interest income from the funding arrangement  however  it provided lower cost of goods and operating costs  which more than offset the impact of the lost interest 
interest on the convertible debt was almost entirely offset by reduced principal balances and lower rates on floating rate debt 
page in accordance with sfas no 
 no interest expense is recognized on the company s public debt securities 
these securities were recorded at an amount equal to the future undiscounted cash payments  both principal and interest  and accordingly  the cash interest payments are charged against the recorded amount of such securities and are not treated as interest expense 
income taxes the company recorded tax expense in of million  million in and a tax benefit of million in higher income tax expense in  when compared to  was due to a settlement of an irs tax examination  resulting in a million tax benefit in the increase in taxes versus resulted from the rise in earnings before income taxes and extraordinary items  which increased by in compared to the tax benefit in was the result of reversing a valuation allowance  based on the company s demonstrated ability to produce higher levels of taxable income  resulting in the recognition of an million deferred tax asset 
extraordinary gain on november   the company completed a tender offer for of the face value of both its first priority senior subordinated debentures due december  million and second priority senior subordinated debentures series a million due june  collectively  the debentures 
under the terms of the offer the final clearing prices were and for the and debentures  respectively  per  face amount  resulting in a cash outlay by the company of million 
to finance the purchase of the debentures  the company issued million in convertible debt to ito yokado co  ltd  and seven eleven japan co  ltd  the joint owners of iyg holding company  which is the company s majority shareholder 
the company recognized a million after tax extraordinary gain on the purchase of the debentures in the fourth quarter of the gain resulted from purchasing the debentures below their face value and from retiring the future undiscounted interest payments on that portion of the debentures that were purchased see interest expense  net section 
liquidity and capital resources the majority of the company s working capital is provided from three sources i cash flows generated from its operating activities  ii a million commercial paper facility guaranteed by ito yokado co  ltd  and iii short term seasonal borrowings of up to million reduced by outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility 
the company believes that operating activities  coupled with available short term working capital facilities  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund current operating and capital expenditure programs  as well as to service debt requirements 
in february  the company issued million of convertible debt to ito yokado co  ltd  and seven eleven japan co  ltd 
the convertible debt is subordinated to all existing debt except the convertible debt which has the same priority ranking 
the debt has a year life  no amortization and an interest rate of 
the instrument gives the company the right to defer interest payments thereon for up to consecutive quarters 
the debt mandatorily converts into  shares of the company s common stock if the company s stock achieves certain levels after the third anniversary of issuance 
the proceeds from the convertible debt will be used to redeem the company s debentures at par with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes 
redemption of the debentures will result in a gain of nearly million from the retirement of future undiscounted interest payments as recorded under sfas no 
in february  the company entered into a new unsecured bank debt credit agreement new credit agreement  refinancing its old term loan million  revolving credit facility and letters of credit million each  collectively secured under the senior bank debt credit agreement old credit agreement  all of which were scheduled to mature on december   with a new term loan facility term loan and revolving credit facility 
the term loan million has scheduled quarterly repayments of million commencing march  through december  the new revolving credit facility million expires february and allows for revolving borrowings revolver  and for issuance of letters of credit not to exceed million 
interest on the term loan and revolver is based on a variable rate equal to the administrative agent bank s base rate or  at the company s option  a rate equal to a reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
per year for drawn amounts 
the new agreement requires letter of credit fees to be paid quarterly at 
per year on the outstanding amount 
in addition  a facility fee of 
per year is charged on the aggregate amount of the new credit agreement facility and is payable quarterly 
the cost of borrowings and letters of credit under the new credit agreement represents a decrease of 
and 
per year  respectively  from the old credit agreement 
in april  the company entered into a million master lease facility mlf  which will be the primary financing for a complete integrated point of sale system see management strategies 
the lease payment on the mlf will be based on a variable rate equal to the libor rate plus a blended all inclusive spread of 
per year 
the six and one half year mlf has a three year noncancellable term with semi annual renewal options 
the commitment period for this lease expires in early  and based upon current roll out schedules  the company does not expect the mlf to be fully funded at that time 
as a result  the company intends to seek an extension of the mlf or find other financing  by the end of  to fully fund the roll out of the point of sale system 
the new credit agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants requiring  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including interest and rent coverage  fixed charge coverage and senior indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the covenant levels established by the new credit agreement generally require continuing improvement in the company s financial condition 
the covenants in the new credit agreement  when compared to the old credit agreement  allow the company more flexibility in its borrowing levels and capital expenditures 
for the period ended december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants required under the new credit agreement  including compliance with the principal financial and operating covenants calculated over the latest month period as follows requirements covenants actuals minimum maximum interest coverage to to fixed charge coverage to to senior indebtedness to ebitda to to includes effects of the sfas no 
interest payments 
in  the company repaid million of debt  which included million for principal payments on the company s yen denominated loan hedged by the royalty income stream from its area licensee in japan and million for sfas no 
interest 
outstanding balances at december   for the commercial paper  the term loan and the revolver  were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the new credit agreement totaled million 
cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million in and million in contributing to the decrease in net cash from operating activities was an increase in inventories  caused by a december cigarette buy in and generally higher per store inventory levels  combined with the timing of payments and receipts see results of operations section 
capital expenditures during  net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of payments of million for property and equipment 
the majority of this capital was used for new store development  continued implementation of the company s retail information system  remodeling stores  new equipment to support merchandising initiatives  upgrading retail gasoline facilities  replacing equipment and complying with environmental regulations 
the proceeds from sale of property and equipment primarily consists of the sale leaseback funding of the master lease facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects capital expenditures  excluding lease commitments  to exceed million 
capital expenditures are being used to develop or acquire new stores  upgrade store facilities  further implement a retail information system  replace equipment  upgrade gasoline facilities and comply with environmental regulations 
the amount of expenditures during the year will be materially impacted by the proportion of new store development funded through working capital versus leases and the speed at which new sites acquisitions can be located  negotiated  permitted and constructed 
in february  the company announced the signing of a definitive agreement with mdk corporation of goshen  indiana  to acquire red d mart convenience stores in the south bend  indiana  area 
the transaction is scheduled to be completed in mid capital expenditures gasoline equipment the company incurs ongoing costs to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations primarily relating to underground storage tank ust systems 
the company anticipates it will spend approximately million in on capital improvements required to comply with environmental regulations relating to usts  as well as above ground vapor recovery equipment at store locations  and approximately an additional million on such capital improvements from through environmental in december  the company closed its chemical manufacturing facility in new jersey 
as a result  the company is required to conduct environmental remediation at the facility and has submitted a clean up plan to the new jersey department of environmental protection the state  which provides for active remediation of the site for approximately a three to five year period  as well as continued groundwater monitoring and treatment for a projected year planning period 
the projected year clean up period represents a reduction from the previously reported year period and is a result of revised estimates as determined by an independent environmental management company in the first quarter of these revised estimates  which generally resulted from the conditional approval of the company s plan  reduced both the estimated time and the estimated costs to complete the project and resulted in decreasing the liability and the related receivable balances by million and million  respectively 
while conditional approval was received on its clean up plan  the company must supply additional information to the state before the plan can be finalized 
the company has recorded undiscounted liabilities representing its best estimates of the clean up costs of million at december  in  the company and the former owner of the facility executed a final settlement pursuant to which the former owner agreed to pay a substantial portion of the clean up costs 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement and the financial resources of the former owner  the company has recorded a receivable of million at december  additionally  the company accrues for the anticipated future costs and the related probable state reimbursement amounts for remediation activities at its existing and previously operated gasoline sites where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
at december   the company s estimated undiscounted liability for these sites was million 
this estimate is based on the company s prior experience with gasoline sites and its consideration of such factors as the age of the tanks  location of tank sites and experience with contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work 
the company anticipates that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases at these sites as of december   will be incurred within the next five years 
under state reimbursement programs  the company is eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of future remediation costs  as well as a portion of remediation costs previously paid 
accordingly  at december   the company has recorded a net receivable of million for the estimated probable state reimbursements 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  the company takes into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  existing claim backlog  status of clean up activity and claim ranking systems 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amount is net of an allowance of million 
while there is no assurance of the timing of the receipt of state reimbursement funds  based on its experience  the company expects to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds  except from california  within one to three years after payment of eligible remediation expenses  assuming that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have been fully developed 
the company estimates that it may take one to seven years to receive reimbursement funds from california 
therefore  the portion of the recorded receivable amounts that relates to sites where remediation activities has been conducted has been discounted at to reflect their present value 
thus  the recorded receivable amount is also net of a discount of million 
the estimated future assessment and remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some of the company s older computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations 
the company has replaced  over the last couple of years  or has plans to replace significant portions of its existing systems with third party provided software which properly interprets dates beyond december  in addition  the company has contracted resources to modify the remainder of its existing software to make it year compliant 
based on a recent assessment  the company believes all system modifications and related testing should be completed by early the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
at this time  based on presently available information  the company does not foresee any material effects related to outside company compliance 
the company does not believe the costs related to the year compliance project will be material to its financial position or results of operations 
however  the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and the actual costs and vendor compliance could differ materially from those plans  resulting in a material financial risk
