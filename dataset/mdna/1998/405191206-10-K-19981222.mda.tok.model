results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal decreased million  or  from the prior fiscal year  to million 
the decrease is attributable to a decrease in net sales of at the direct distribution centers  at the full service distribution centers and at the advantage auto stores 
these decreases are generally attributable to softness in the auto parts industry caused by various factors  which include improved vehicle manufacturing and performance  longer vehicle warranties  leased vehicles  warranted pre owned vehicles  and increased competition 
throughout the fiscal year the company closed seven advantage auto stores and opened five new locations  which contributed to the net sales decline in the division

fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal increased million  or  from the prior fiscal year  to million 
the increase is attributable to net sales increases of at the direct distribution centers and at the full service distribution centers  partially offset by a net sales decline of at the advantage auto stores 
the direct distribution centers increase resulted from the october nu way acquisition and a increase in comparable location sales from the previous fiscal year 
the advantage auto stores net sales decline is principally due to three store closings during fiscal and a decrease in comparable net sales primarily as the result of general softness in the automotive parts industry and increased competition 
gross profit from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or  of net sales for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased as the result of two acquisitions during fiscal  and to a lesser extent  the changing sales mix and maturation of the direct distribution division  which generally has a higher gross margin than full service distribution center sales

see note to company s consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal the appropriate waivers were received for the fixed charge covenant deficiencies 
in december  fleet capital agreed to change the company s fixed charge coverage ratio to 
for the first two quarters of fiscal  and to 
and for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively  which will be measured quarter by quarter 
as of november   the company had an outstanding balance of million under the new credit facility with availability of million 
in the autoworks chapter proceeding  the unsecured creditors committee had indicated that it may pursue certain claims against the company 
on april   a settlement agreement and release was negotiated between the company and the committee 
under the settlement agreement and release  the committee agreed to release the company from all claims in exchange for the company s payment to the autoworks bankruptcy estate of up to a maximum of million over five years 
if certain payments are made in a timely manner  the company will pay less than million  but not less than million by june  the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and release by order dated june   the settlement agreement and release was thereafter signed by all parties and the company made the first payment to the autoworks bankruptcy estate in the amount of  on july  in the future the company may make minor strategic acquisitions and open new direct distribution centers and advantage auto stores to the extent that its debt service and other funding requirements permit 
the company s ability to open new direct distribution centers depends on the company s ability to negotiate extended payment terms with vendors  which initially minimizes additional working capital requirements and on consents from the company s lender 
the company anticipates that its sources of cash flow will provide sufficient working capital to operate its business  make expected capital expenditures and to meet its other short term and longer term liquidity needs at least through the end of fiscal year the year issue is the result of computer software programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s software programs  computer hardware or equipment that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in miscalculation or system failures 
the plan is to devote necessary resources required to resolve any significant year issues in a timely manner 
the company has developed an informal plan to ensure that all of its significant date sensitive computer software and hardware systems and other equipment utilized in its various distribution and administrative activities utilizing embedded chips or software  will be year compliant and operational on a timely basis 
the formal plan will address all of the company s locations and includes a review of computer applications that connect elements of the company s business directly to its customers and suppliers 
the plan is also to include an assessment process to determine that the company s significant customers and suppliers third party activities will also be year compliant 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue includes four major phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
the company has substantially completed the assessment phase of its plan for all of its significant information technology and operating equipment that it believes could be affected by the year issue 
based upon its assessment  the company concluded that it would be necessary to reprogram and or replace certain of its information technology 
the company also determined that certain of its operating equipment would also require modifications to make certain they remain operational 
the remediation of operating equipment is approximately complete  and the company is targeting completion of its related remediation efforts by the end of the second quarter of certain desktop personal computers that were year deficient have been replaced as part of the company s scheduled rotation replacement program  the cost of which does not impact the year project 
testing and implementation of the affected equipment is targeted to be substantially completed during the second quarter of next year 
to date  the company has not identified any information technology it or non it system that presents a material risk of not being year ready or for which a suitable alternative cannot be implemented 
however  as the initiative moves further into the testing phase  it is possible that the company may identify potential risks of year disruption 
it is also possible that such a disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is still in the process of modifying or replacing certain time sensitive software programs and other date sensitive devices to avoid a potential inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
with respect to third party activities  the company will make inquiries of its significant customers and suppliers and  at the present time  is not aware of problems that would materially impact the company s operations 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that these customers and suppliers and in turn their customers and suppliers will be year compliant in a timely manner 
the inability of these parties to successfully resolve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company 
software modification to the company s mainframe computer system has already begun 
the vendor of the system has commenced the distribution of year software upgrades 
it is anticipated that all upgrades will be implemented and tested by the end of the second quarter of there will be no expense to the company  as modified year software is a part of the company s software maintenance agreement 
substantially all of the company owned remote store systems have been upgraded with modified year software without cost to the company  as these costs are also protected under the software maintenance agreement for these systems 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the required year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project including renovation  validation and implementation by june  the company s total cost to address the year issue is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flow 
the elements of such costs are as follows amounts in thousands of dollars incurred through costs yet total september  to be estimated incurred cost capital expenditures related to new systems and equipment operating expenses related to modifications of existing systems and equipment total capital and expense the company could potentially experience disruptions to some aspects of its various activities and operations as a result of non compliant systems utilized by the company or unrelated third parties 
contingency plans are  therefore  under development to mitigate the extent of any such potential disruption to business operations 
the costs of the year project and the date which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains  and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no

it also requires that an enterprise a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
the company will begin reporting comprehensive income in its quarterly filing on form q as of and for the quarter ended december  it s comprehensive income will consist of net income  as historically reported  and the unrealized gain loss on the marketable security owned by the company see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  which is currently reported as a component of stockholders equity in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprises and related information which establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and majorcustomers 
sfas no 
 which is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december   or the company s fiscal  generally requires that financial information be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
in the initial year of application  comparative information for earlier years is to be restated 
the company will begin reporting segment information in its annual filing on form k as of and for the fiscal year ended september   and will continue to report such information in its quarterly filings on form q thereafter 
the company believes that it has two reportable segments under sfas no 
 differentiated along the channel of distribution direct vs 
full service as discussed under the caption business in item of this report 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
in general  the company has been able to pass on to its customers any increases in the cost of its inventory 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on the demand for automotive aftermarket products 
historically  the company s net sales and gross profits have been higher in the second half of each fiscal year than in the first half 
important information regarding forward looking statements certain statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts  including but not limited to i anticipated trends in the company s business and the automotive replacement parts industry  ii the sufficiency of cash to fund the company s debt service requirements and working capital needs iii certain statements found under the captions results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and year  are forward looking statements within the meanings of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of  as amended  such statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  plan and similar expressions 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
the actual results of the future events described in the forward looking statements in this form k could materially differ from those contemplated in the forward looking statements in this form k 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties i discussed herein  ii contained in the company s other public reports and filings and public statements from time to time and iii set forth below the company is highly leveraged  with substantial existing indebtedness 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness will depend on its future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  prevailing interest rate levels  and financial  competitive  business and other factors beyond its control 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences  including i the company s future ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes may be limited because of the existence of this indebtedness and the borrowing advance terms thereof  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness until its term loan and supplemental line of credit have been paid in full  thereby reducing funds available for operation  iii certain of the company s borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could cause the company to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates  and iv the company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and may be limited in its ability to respond to changes in the automotive parts industry and competitive pressures 
failure to comply with the company s payment  covenant or other obligations under its credit facilities could result in a default thereunder that  if not cured or waived  could result in acceleration of the relevant indebtedness or of other indebtedness governed by agreements or instruments containing cross default provisions 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and its dollar sales and unit volume could be negatively affected by its ability to maintain or increase prices  changes in sales mix and changes in the demand for automotive products and changes in the automotive replacement parts industry generally  including pricing and other changes by the company s competitors 
the company competes directly and indirectly with numerous distributors  retailers and manufacturers of automotive aftermarket products  some of which distribute in channels that may be expanding in terms of market share relative to the channels in which the company distributes its products 
in addition  some of the company s current and potential competitors are larger  have greater financial resources  and are less leveraged than the company 
furthermore  particularly in light of the trend in the automotive parts industry toward increasing consolidation at the warehouse and jobber levels  the company s financial performance may be significantly affected by the company s ability to compete successfully for associated jobber customers and otherwise take advantage of consolidation opportunities and other trends 
the company s financial performance is subject to and could be negatively impacted by changes in economic conditions  vehicle quality  extension of new parts warranties and maintenance  vehicle scrappage rates and weather conditions  which can cause seasonal variations in the company s results of operations 
the occurrence of violent weather or mild weather may result in significant fluctuations in operating results 
temperature extremes tend to enhance sales by causing a higher incidence of parts failure and increasing sales of seasonal products  while milder weather tends to depress sales 
in light of the trend in the automotive parts industry toward increasing consolidation at the warehouse and jobber levels  the company s financial performance may be significantly affected by the company s ability to compete successfully for associated jobber customers and otherwise take advantage of consolidation opportunities and other industry trends 
the company s ability to do so depends on its ability to secure the consent of its lender to future acquisitions and its ability to finalize such transactions 
if such a transaction is effected  the company s financial performance will depend on its ability to conclude the acquisitions on favorable terms and to enhance those acquisitions and integrate them into its operations 
full realization of the potential benefits of any significant acquisition will be dependent upon a variety of factors  including i retention of a substantial portion of sales  ii achieving sales volumes sufficient to utilize reductions in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  iii achieving significant reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses by  among other things  consolidating redundant operating and administrative facilities and closure of non performing facilities and iv obtaining deferred payment terms and other changeover incentives from suppliers 
there can be no assurance as to the extent to which any such benefits may be realized from any acquisitions or the timing of any such realization 
failure to achieve a substantial portion of such potential benefits within time frames anticipated by the company could materially and adversely affect the company s future results of operations and financial position 
the company s past success has been largely dependent on certain key personnel of the company  including michael futerman and eli n 
futerman 
the loss of the services of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in order to implement and manage its growth strategy  the company will be dependent upon its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to secure or retain such personnel 
the company is a defendant in various lawsuits 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any of these lawsuits 
to the extent that the company sustains losses growing out of any pending litigation which are presently not reserved or otherwise provided for  its earnings and liquidity could be adversely affected 
the failure of the company or its material suppliers to effectively address year issues could adversely effect its future earnings and liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company holds a zero coupon bond to secure certain self insured claims 
the fair market value of such bond was approximately  as of september  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the value of the bond tends to fluctuate with market interest rate movements 
the company does not believe that the security is material to the company s financial position  results of operation or cash flows
