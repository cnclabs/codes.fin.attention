item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s net income was million for  as compared with million for and million for diluted earnings per common share were for  up from in  which had increased from in the company s returns on average assets and average stockholders equity increased to and  respectively  in  from and  respectively  in and from and  respectively  in contributing to the million improvement in net income for  as compared with  were increases in net interest income  fee income  and gains associated with mortgage banking activities  as well as the effect of a million charge in to recapitalize the saif the saif special assessment 
these factors were offset  in part  by a higher level of securities related losses associated with balance sheet restructuring initiatives and increases in certain expenses due primarily to business expansion efforts  as well as million of income tax benefits recognized during in connection with the final resolution of certain tax filing positions taken in prior years 
in december  the company implemented a balance sheet restructuring initiative  which included the transfer of its entire billion portfolio of securities held to maturity to securities available for sale 
as part of this initiative  which was undertaken in conjunction with the company s reassessment of its asset liability management strategy  the company designated billion of the transferred securities for sale 
it is anticipated that such securities will be sold during the company experienced growth in loan production in all lending areas in  as compared with  particularly with respect to residential real estate loans  which increased largely as a result of the namc acquisition 
the company s total loan production which consists of both originations and purchases amounted to billion for  up billion from the prior year 
the namc acquisition also contributed significantly to an almost increase in the company s portfolio of loans serviced for others during  which amounted to billion at the end of the year 
in connection with the bfs acquisition  the company acquired five new york city branches with deposits of approximately million at the date of the acquisition 
in addition  the bfs acquisition added approximately million to the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio 
non performing assets declined from million at december  to million at year end  principally due to the sales of approximately million of non performing residential real estate assets during the second quarter of the npa sales 
in connection with the npa sales  the company recorded special provisions for loan and other real estate owned ore losses totaling million 
results of operations net interest income net interest income amounted to million in  up million  or  from  primarily due to an increase in the company s net interest margin to for from for the prior year 
this improvement in the net interest margin principally reflects the company s operating strategy of increasing its emphasis on loans  while reducing its reliance on mbs  which  in general  provide a lower yield than the company s loans 
in  as compared with  the average balance of loans increased billion  or  while the average balance of mbs declined billion  or 
loans represented of total average interest earning assets during  as compared with of total average interest earning assets during the prior year 
improved asset quality  principally as a result of the npa sales  and growth in deposits as a percentage of total interest bearing liabilities  due in part to the bfs acquisition  also contributed to the improved net interest margin 
these factors were partially offset by a flattening of the interest rate yield curve during  higher borrowing costs  and a million investment during the third quarter of in a bank owned life insurance program the boli program  associated revenues of which are reflected in non interest income 
the company expects that the flat interest rate yield curve  if sustained  will continue to exert pressure on its net interest income and net interest margin 
during  net interest income amounted to million  an increase of from million during  despite a million reduction in average interest earning assets 
the company s net interest margin of for increased basis points from the level in significant factors contributing to the increases in net interest income and the net interest margin in as compared with included growth in average loans of million  or  a more favorable interest rate yield curve  lower overall funding costs  and a balance sheet restructuring plan initiated at the end of as part of that plan  the company  during  sold approximately billion of securities available for sale  including certain lower yielding mbs  the proceeds from which were primarily used to reduce borrowed funds

during  the company recognized net gains of million on sales of loan servicing rights  substantially due to a sale  in december  of approximately billion in principal amount of loan servicing rights 
the sale of loan servicing rights in december was associated with the company s interest rate risk management program and was intended to reduce the impact of a declining long term interest rate environment on the company s mortgage servicing assets 
during  the company sold approximately billion in principal amount of loan servicing rights and recognized gains of million 
no such sales occurred during sales of loan servicing rights are dependent on a variety of factors  including market conditions and existing operating strategies  thus  the level of future sales of loan servicing rights  if any  cannot currently be predicted 
during  the company sold four florida branches and one new york branch with aggregate deposits at the time of sale of approximately million 
a net gain of million was recognized on these sales

other 
other non interest income amounted to million for  as compared with million and million for and  respectively

non interest expense amounted to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the million growth in non interest expense in as compared with was principally associated with the namc acquisition 
the increase in non interest expense of million in as compared with the prior year was primarily attributable to the saif special assessment  coupled with certain non recurring personnel expenses and business expansion efforts  primarily with respect to its residential real estate loan origination capabilities 
the impact of these factors was mitigated by a reduction in restructuring and related expense associated with the anchor merger and legislation which reduced the bank s federal deposit insurance premiums

large  jr  the company s former chief executive officer  and severance benefits incurred in as a result of the relocation of the headquarters of the company s mortgage banking operations from uniondale  new york to tampa  florida  the effects of which were partially offset by anchor merger related staff reductions 
the increases in compensation and employee benefits expense in and  as compared with the respective prior years  also reflect  among other factors  higher levels of commissions and incentives  as well as the impact of normal merit increases 
occupancy and equipment expense  net  was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with the prior year 
the growth in such expense was largely the result of business expansion efforts  including the namc acquisition and the bfs acquisition  and the enhancement of the company s technological capabilities 
occupancy and equipment expense  net  which amounted to million in  had declined million  or  from  substantially due to cost savings associated with the anchor merger  including the closing of of the bank s branches 
other g a expense increased to million for from million for  largely due to the acquisitions of namc and bfs  which  among other things  contributed significantly to year to year increases of million in data processing and communications expense and million in goodwill amortization 
the higher level of other g a expense in  as compared with  also reflects expenses of million incurred during in connection with the development and implementation of a plan to prepare the company s computer systems for the year see year issue 
other general and administrative expense in rose million from million in this increase was primarily associated with a million rise in marketing expenses  due principally to television advertising costs  the outsourcing of additional aspects of the company s data processing operations during the first quarter of  and the implementation of various other strategic initiatives 
other general and administrative expense levels in and  as compared with the respective prior years  were reduced by million and million  respectively  as a result of lower federal deposit insurance premiums due to certain legislative actions during and amortization of mortgage servicing assets

during  amortization of mortgage servicing assets was million  down from million in at december   the carrying value of the company s mortgage servicing assets was million  up  primarily due to the namc acquisition  from million and million at year end and  respectively 
in a declining long term interest rate environment  actual or expected prepayments of the loans underlying the company s mortgage servicing assets portfolio may increase  which would have an adverse impact on the value of such assets 
in connection therewith  the company  during  expanded its use of derivative financial instruments as a hedge against its mortgage servicing assets see asset liability management derivative financial instruments and sold approximately billion in principal amount of loan servicing rights underlying the mortgage servicing assets portfolio  which resulted in a reduction in the carrying value of that portfolio of approximately million 
other real estate owned ore expense  net

year issue the company acknowledges the challenges posed worldwide due to the current inability of certain computer systems to properly recognize the date change from december  to january  failure to adequately meet these challenges could have a material adverse effect on the operations of a financial institution  such as the company 
the company has completed the process of assessing the systems issues associated with this year problem and adopted a plan to prepare its computer systems  software  and applications to properly process dates beyond december  the year plan 
the year plan requires modifications to be made to certain of the company s existing systems and  in other cases  conversions to new systems or software 
in addition  the company is involved in ongoing communications with its significant third party contractors  such as vendors and service providers  for the purpose of evaluating their readiness to meet the challenges of the year and the extent to which the company may be affected by the remediation of their systems  software  and applications 
the company cannot guarantee that the computer systems of its third party contractors will be remediated on a timely basis or that the failure of any such party to remediate  or a remediation that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company anticipates that the primary costs associated with the development and implementation of the year plan will be in the areas of remediation and testing of its computer applications  principally consisting of costs related to outside consultants and applications upgrades 
the company currently estimates that this plan  including unit testing  will be completed by the end of  with full integrated testing completed by the second quarter of  and that total related pretax costs will be approximately million  of which approximately is expected to be incurred during these estimates are based on certain assumptions relating to future events  including  but not limited to  the remediation efforts of third party contractors  the continued availability of certain resources  and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could be significantly different from those estimates  due to  among other factors  the unavailability and cost of trained personnel and the failure to identify all affected systems 
asset liability management general the goal of asset liability management is the prudent control of market risk  liquidity  and capital 
asset liability management is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the boards of directors of the holding company and the bank  which oversee the development and execution of risk management strategies in furtherance of these polices 
the asset liability management committee almac  which is comprised of members of the company s senior management  monitors the company s interest rate risk position and related strategies 
market risk in general  market risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices  such as prices of equities 
market rate sensitive instruments include derivative financial instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps and options  other financial instruments  such as investments  loans  mbs  deposits  and other debt obligations  and derivative commodity instruments  such as commodity futures  forwards  swaps and options that are permitted to be settled in cash or another financial instrument 
the company did not enter into any market rate sensitive instruments for trading purposes during however  as discussed below  the company enters into such instruments in connection with its various business operations  particularly its mortgage banking activities 
loans originated  and the related commitments to originate loans that will be sold  represent market risk that is realized in a short period of time  generally two to three months 
the company s primary source of market risk exposure arises from changes in united states interest rates and the effects thereof on mortgage prepayment and closing behavior  as well as depositors choices interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates may result in reduced earnings and erosion of the market value of assets and liabilities 
the company does not have any material exposure to foreign exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
movements in equity prices may have an indirect  but limited  effect on certain of the company s business activities and or the value of credit sensitive loans and securities 
interest rate risk management the company manages its interest rate risk through strategies designed to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate exposure throughout a range of interest rate environments 
these strategies are intended not only to protect the company from significant long term declines in net interest income as a result of certain changes in the interest rate environment  but also to mitigate the negative effect of certain interest rate changes upon the company s mortgage banking operating results 
the company seeks to contain its interest rate risk within a band that it believes is manageable and prudent given its capital and income generating capacity 
as a component of its interest rate risk management process  the company employs various derivative financial instruments 
the company s sensitivity to interest rates is driven primarily by the mismatch between the term to maturity or repricing of its interest earning assets and that of its interest bearing liabilities 
in general  the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature  on average  sooner than its interest earning assets 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk arising from the option risk embedded in many of the company s interest earning assets 
for example  mortgages and the mortgages underlying mbs may contain prepayment options  interim and lifetime interest rate caps and other such features driven or otherwise influenced by changes in interest rates 
prepayment option risk affects mortgage related assets in both rising and falling interest rate environments as the financial incentive to refinance a mortgage loan is directly related to the level of the existing interest rate on the loan relative to current market interest rates 
extension risk on mortgage related assets is the risk that the duration of such assets may increase as a result of declining prepayments due to rising interest rates 
certain mortgage related assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than others  resulting in a higher risk profile 
because the company s interest bearing liabilities are not similarly affected  the company s overall duration gap generally increases as interest rates rise 
in addition  in a rising interest rate environment  adjustable rate assets may reach interim or lifetime interest rate caps  thereby limiting the amount of upward adjustment  which effectively lengthens the duration of such assets 
lower interest rate environments may also present interest rate exposure 
in general  lower interest rate environments tend to accelerate prepayment rates  which both shorten the duration of mortgage related assets and accelerate the amortization of any premiums paid in the acquisition of these assets 
the recognition of premiums over a shorter than expected term causes yields on the related assets to decline from anticipated levels 
in addition  unanticipated accelerated prepayment rates increase the likelihood of potential losses of net future servicing revenues associated with the company s mortgage servicing assets 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk resulting from certain changes in the shape of the yield curve particularly a flattening or inversion also called yield curve twist risk of the yield curve and to differing indices upon which the yield on the company s interest earning assets and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities are based basis risk 
as further described below  in evaluating and managing its interest rate risk  the company employs simulation models to help assess its interest rate risk exposure and the impact  and probability of occurrence  of alternate interest rate scenarios  which consider the effects of adjustable rate loan indices  periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  estimated loan prepayments  anticipated deposit retention rates  and other dynamics of the company s portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
moreover  in order to reduce its sensitivity to interest rate risk  the company s investment strategy has emphasized adjustable rate loans and securities and fixed rate medium term securities 
derivative financial instruments the company uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to assist in managing its interest rate risk exposures 
derivative financial instruments employed by the company at december  were interest rate swaps  interest rate swaptions  interest rate floors  interest rate caps  forward contracts to purchase or sell loans or securities  and options to purchase or sell certain of these and other instruments at designated prices 
while the company s use of derivative financial instruments has served to mitigate the unfavorable effects changes in interest rates may have on its results of operations  the company continues to be susceptible to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management instruments 
the company s assets generally reprice or mature at a longer term than the liabilities used to fund those assets 
consequently  the company uses derivative financial instruments in its efforts to reduce the repricing risk 
the company uses three major classes of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk interest rate swaps  where the company pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate  interest rate caps  where the company receives the excess  if any  of the prevailing floating rate usually london interbank offered rates libor over a specified rate the cap level  and interest rate swaptions  where  in exchange for the payment of a premium  the company has the right to enter into pay fixed interest rate swaps at a future date 
the pay fixed rate swaps are used to modify specific variable rate liabilities and thereby improve the stability of the company s net interest margin 
interest rate caps are used to hedge the periodic and lifetime rate caps embedded in specific adjustable rate loans and securities and to limit the effect of increases in the cost of short term funds above certain specified maximum levels 
interest rate swaptions are used to hedge the repricing risk on certain assets with high prepayment risk 
the use of derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes resulted in decreases in net interest income during and of million and million  respectively  as compared with an increase in net interest income of million during mortgage banking risk management instruments 
the company uses two major classes of derivative financial instruments to protect against the impact of substantial declines in long term interest rates and the consequent increase in mortgage prepayment rates interest rate swaps  where the company receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate  and interest rate floors  where the company receives the difference  if any  between a designated average long term interest rate usually the ten year constant maturity treasury index and a specified strike rate 
the company uses three major classes of derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk in its loans held for sale and loan purchase commitment pipeline 
to the extent that the company is confident that it will have loans to sell  the company sells loans into the forward mbs market 
such short sales are similar in composition as to term and coupon with the loans held in  or expected to be funded into  the loans held for sale portfolio 
in addition  because the amount of loans that the company will fund  as compared with the total amount of loans that it has committed to fund  is uncertain  the company purchases various options  including puts and calls on both the forward mbs market and the interest rate futures market
