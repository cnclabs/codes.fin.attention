such laws typically impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such substances 
the costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to promptly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person 
certain laws also impose requirements on conditions and activities that may affect the environment or the impact of the environment on human health 
failure to comply with such requirements could result in the imposition of monetary penalties in addition to the costs to achieve compliance and potential liabilities to third parties 
among other things  certain laws require abatement or removal of friable and certain non friable asbestos containing materials acms in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling 
certain laws regarding acms require building owners and lessees  among other things  to notify and train certain employees working in areas known or presumed to contain acms

all of the properties but not properties for which the company holds an option to purchase but does not yet own have been subject to phase i environmental assessments or updates of existing phase i environmental assessments within approximately the last six years 
such assessments generally consisted of a visual inspection of the properties  review of federal and state environmental databases and certain information regarding historic uses of the property and adjacent areas and the preparation and issuance of written reports 
some of the properties contain  or contained  underground storage tanks used for storing petroleum products or wastes typically associated with automobile service or other operations conducted at the properties 
certain properties contain  or contained  dry cleaning establishments utilizing solvents 
where believed to be warranted  samplings of building materials or subsurface investigations were  or  with respect to one property  will be undertaken 
at certain properties  where warranted by the conditions  the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance program that establishes operating procedures with respect to acms 
the costs associated with the development and implementation for such programs were not material 
although there can be no assurances that such environmental liability does not exist  none of the environmental assessments have identified and the company is not aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties in which the company or the operating partnership has or had an interest whether as an owner or operator that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
nevertheless  it is possible that the environmental assessments available to the company do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities  that subsequent investigations will identify material contamination  that adverse environmental conditions have arisen subsequent to the performance of the environmental assessments  or that there are material environmental liabilities of which management is unaware 
moreover  no assurances can be given that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of the properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the properties or by third parties unrelated to the company  the operating partnership or the relevant property partnership 
the existence of any such environmental liability could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flow and the funds available to the company to pay dividends 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
general risks of the company s business general factors affecting investments in shopping center properties and effect of economic and real estate conditions a shopping center s revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national and regional economic climates  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of retail space  perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center  and the willingness and ability of the shopping center s owner to provide capable management and maintenance services 
in addition  other factors may adversely affect a shopping center s value without affecting its current revenues  including changes in governmental regulations  zoning or tax laws  potential environmental or other legal liabilities  availability of financing  and changes in interest rate levels 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at the properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  outlet malls  wholesale clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and  most recently  shopping via the internet 
competition could adversely affect the operating partnership s revenues and funds available for distribution to partners  which in turn will affect the company s revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders 
geographic concentration the properties are located principally in the southeastern united states in alabama  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
seventeen malls  eleven associated centers  sixty four community centers and the office building are located in these states

as of december   the properties located in the southeastern united states accounted for of the company s total assets  and provided of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  third party interests in certain properties the operating partnership owns partial interests in six malls  five associated centers  one community center and the office building 
the operating partnership or an affiliate of the company is the managing general partner of the property partnerships that own such properties  except for the governor s square mall and its associated center  governor s plaza  in which affiliates of the operating partnership are non managing general partners 
where the operating partnership serves as managing general partner of property partnerships  it may have certain fiduciary responsibilities to the other partners in those partnerships 
in certain cases  the approval or consent of the other partners is required before the operating partnership may sell  finance  expand or make other significant changes in the operations of such properties 
to the extent such approvals or consents are required  the operating partnership may experience difficulty in  or may be prevented from implementing its plans with respect to expansion  development  financing or other similar transactions with respect to such properties 
with respect to governor s square and governor s plaza  the operating partnership does not have day to day operational control or control over certain major decisions  including the timing and amount of distributions and decisions relating to sales  expansions and financings  which could result in decisions by the managing general partner that do not fully reflect the interests of the company  including decisions relating to the standards that the company is required to satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes 
dependence on significant properties hamilton place and coolsprings galleria accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total revenues of the company for the period ended december  the company s financial position and results of operations will therefore be disproportionately affected by the results experienced at these properties 
dependence on key tenants the limited inc stores including intimate brands maintains mall stores and in the year ended december  accounted for approximately of total revenues of the company 
food lion serves as an anchor tenant in of the community centers and in one associated center

the company s strategy for growth management believes that per share growth in the company s funds from operations  as defined below  is one of the key factors in enhancing shareholder value 
management also believes that funds from operations is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits  and its consistent determination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
it is the objective of the company s management to achieve growth in funds from operations through the aggressive management of the company s existing properties  the expansion and renovation of existing properties  the development of new properties  and select acquisitions 
funds from operations can also be affected by external factors  such as inflation  fluctuations in interest rates or changes in general economic conditions  which are beyond the control of the company s management 
funds from operations is defined by the company as gaap net income loss before property depreciation  other non cash items consisting of the effect of straight lining of rents  gains or losses on sales of real estate and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
funds from operations also includes the company s share of funds from operations from unconsolidated affiliates but minority investors interests are excluded from funds from operations 
the company complies with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit revised definition of funds from operations by not adding back to income from operations depreciation and amortization of finance costs and non real estate assets 
the company continues to exclude outparcel sales and the effect of straight line rents from its funds from operations calculation  even though the revised definition allows the inclusion of such items 
funds from operations is a non gaap statement and does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

risks associated with the company s growth strategy in connection with the implementation of this growth strategy  the company and the operating partnership will incur various risks including the risk that development or expansion opportunities explored by the company and the operating partnership may be abandoned  the risk that construction costs of aproject may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project not profitable  the risk that the company and the operating partnership may not be able to refinance construction loans which are generally with full recourse to the company and the operating partnership  the risk that occupancy rates and rents at a completed project will not meet projections  and will therefore be insufficient to make the project profitable  and the need for anchor  mortgage lender and property partner approvals for certain expansion activities 
in the event of an unsuccessful development project  the company s and the operating partnership s loss could exceed its investment in the project 
the company has in the past elected not to proceed with certain development projects and anticipates that it will do so again from time to time in the future 
if the company elects not to proceed with a development opportunity  the development costs associated therewith ordinarily will be charged against income for the then current period 
any such charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken 
competition there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at the properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  outlet malls  wholesale clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition could adversely affect the operating partnership s revenues and funds available for distributions to partners  which in turn will affect the company s revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with tenant sales achieving the highest levels during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
the malls earn most of their temporary rents rents from short term tenants during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year 
qualification as a real estate investment trust the company has elected to be taxed as real estate investment trust under the code  commencing with its taxable year ended december   and will seek to maintain such status

if the company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates

management believes that the properties are adequately insured in accordance with industry standards

clair square and foothills mall  which were acquired during  were included in the stabilized mall category at december  in the years ended december   and  average stabilized mall store sales per square foot were approximately  and  respectively computed using a monthly weighted average 
average stabilized mall store sales per square foot increased by for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  average base rent per square foot at the mall stores decreased from at december  to at december  average base rents decreased in the mall stores during due to the fact that several higher quality  larger space tenants leased space during the year 
the revenue increases from increases in occupancy have more than made up for any reduction in revenues from average base rents going forward 
occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for tenants in the stabilized malls excluding st 
clair square and foothills mall from and were  and for the years   and  respectively 
the malls are generally located in middle markets 
management believes that the malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only or largest enclosed malls within their respective trade areas

it is management s expectation that the company will continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and grow its business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken by the reit as suitable opportunities arise 
such activities are not expected to be undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved 
the company will fund its major development  expansion and acquisition activity with its traditional sources of construction and permanent debt financing as well as from other debt and equity financings  including public financings  and its credit facilities 
other capital expenditures management prepares an annual capital expenditure budget for each property which is intended to provide for all necessary recurring capital improvements 
management believes that its annual operating reserve for maintenance and recurring capital improvements and reimbursements from tenants will provide the necessary funding for such requirements 
the company intends to distribute approximately to of its funds from operations with the remaining to to be held as a reserve for capital expenditures and continued growth opportunities 
major tenant finish costs for currently vacant space are expected to be funded with working capital  operating reserves  or revolving lines of credit  and a return on the funds so invested is expected to be earned 
for the year ended december   revenue generating capital expenditures or tenant allowances for improvements were million 
these capital expenditures generate a return by increased rents from these tenants over the term of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  or remodeling and renovation costs  were million 
revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as parking lot and roof repairs  which are recovered from the tenants  were million in the company believes that the properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the handling  discharge and emission of hazardous or toxic substances 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority  and is not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents from the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
year issues the company has certain existing computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send orders and invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed a program to identify its applications that are not year compliant 
as a result of this identification program  the company believes that while its core accounting application is year compliant  certain of its other applications are not yet year compliant 
the company has undertaken to correct or replace all non compliant systems and applications 
given the information known at this time about the company s systems that are noncompliant and the company s ongoing efforts to correct or replace all non compliant systems  management does not expect the year compliance of the company s systems to have a material effect on the company s future liquidity or results of operations 
no assurance can be given  however  that all of the company s systems will be year compliant or that compliance costs or the impact of a failure by the company to achieve substantial year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future liquidity or results of operations 
the company has initiated communications with its significant suppliers and tenants to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of such parties to remediate their year compliance issues 
no assurance can be given  however  that the systems of these outside parties will be made year compliant in a timely manner or that the noncompliance of the systems of any of these parties would not have a materially affect on the company s liquidity or results of operations

for all periods ending after january cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the cash provided from the operations of thirteen new properties and the acquisition of four properties in the last twenty four months 
cash flows used in investing activities for increased by million  or  to million compared to million in this increase was due primarily to the borrowing and escrow of cash on december  to purchase asheville mall in asheville  north carolina on january   offset by a smaller dollar amount of acquisitions in as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities for increased by million  or  compared to primarily due to increased borrowings related to the development and acquisition program offset by the january follow on offering which was used to pay down borrowings 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations as defined on page provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the properties 
funds from operations is defined by the company as net income loss before property depreciation  other non cash items consisting of the effect of straight lining of rents and the write off of development projects not being pursued  gains or losses on sales of real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
the cost of interest rate caps and finance costs on the company s lines of credit are amortized in interest expense and therefore reduces funds from operations 
the company s calculation of funds from operations excludes the difference in average rents straight lining and actual rents received 
funds from operations also includes the company s share of funds from operations in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of funds from operations in consolidated properties 
the use of funds from operations as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the operating partnership and the company 
accordingly  management expects that funds from operations will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners including the company 
management also believes that funds from operations is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits and provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash from operations available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in  funds from operations increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in the increase in funds from operations was primarily attributable to the continuing increase in revenues and income from operations  new developments and acquisitions 
beginning with the first quarter of the company complied with nareit s revised definition of funds from operations by not adding back depreciation and amortization of finance costs and non real estate assets to income from operations 
the company has restated prior year s funds from operations to conform with the revised definition 
although nareit allows it the company will continue to exclude outparcel sales which would have added million in and the effect of straight line rents which would have added million in from its funds from operations calculation  even though the revised definition allows their inclusion 
the company s calculation of funds from operations is as follows dollars in thousands three months ended year ended december  december  income from operations     add depreciation amortization from consolidated properties     income from operations of unconsolidated affiliates   depreciation amortization from unconsolidated affiliates   write off of development costs charged to net income subtract minority investors share of income from operations in nine properties minority investors share of depreciation and amortization in nine properties preference return paid to mortgagees adjustment for the straight lining of rents consolidated properties   unconsolidated affiliates minority investor s share of nine propertiese depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets amd finance costs total funds from operations
