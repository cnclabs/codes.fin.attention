air services the company s air courier and airfreight service begins with a customer placing an order  which is then dispatched for pickup by a local driver 
a tracking number is assigned to the shipment and entered into the company s computer system 
the computer system than selects the optimal route for the shipment based on delivery  destination and timing considerations  tracks the shipment as it flows through the delivery stream until it is ultimately delivered to the recipient and prepares the appropriate billing charges 
at the final destination  a proof of delivery is obtained to conclude and confirm the delivery 
at any point in the process  the company is able to inform the customer as to the exact location of its shipment within the distribution network 
sales and marketing the company believes that a direct sales force most effectively reaches its customers for same day delivery services and  accordingly  the company does not currently engage in mass media advertising 
the company markets directly to individual customers by designing and offering customized service packages after determining a customer s specific delivery and distribution requirements 
the company is implementing a coordinated major account strategy by building on established relationships with regional and national customers 
the company also employs certain direct response marketing techniques 
many of the services provided by the company  such as facilities management  distribution and scheduled services  are determined on the basis of competitive bids 
however  the company believes that quality and service capabilities are also important competitive factors 
in certain instances  the company has obtained business by offering a superior level of service  even though it was not the low bidder for a particular contract 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from customers with whom it has entered into contracts 
virtually all scheduled dedicated vehicle and facilities management services are provided pursuant to contracts 
most of these contracts are terminable by the customer on relatively short notice without penalty 
competition the market for the company s delivery service is highly competitive 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which it competes are reliability  quality  breadth of service and price 
the company competes on all such factors 
most of the company s competitors in the same day ground and air delivery market are privately held companies that operate in only one location or in a limited service area 
however  there is a growing trend toward consolidation in the industry 
certain of the company s competitors have recently consolidated  such as corporate express  inc  dynamex inc and dispatch management services  inc 
in addition  ups and fedex have begun to provide same day air delivery services 
in addition to the same day delivery services provided by the company  customers also utilize next day and second day services 
the market for next day and second day services is dominated by nationwide network providers  such as fedex and ups  which have built large  capital intensive distribution channels that allow them to process a high volume of materials 
in order to effectively operate their networks  these companies typically have fixed deadlines for next day or second day delivery services 
in contrast  the company specializes in on demand  next flight out deliveries or services which  by their nature  are not governed by rigid time schedules 
if a customer is unable to meet a network provider s established deadline  the company can pick up the shipment  put it on the next available flight and deliver it  in some cases  before the network provider s scheduled delivery time 
the company s services are available twenty four hours a day  seven days a week 
the company obtains space on scheduled airline flights to provide its air services and accordingly does not have to acquire or maintain an expensive fleet of airplanes 
as a result  the company can provide a more flexible  specialized service to its customers without incurring the high fixed overhead that the larger network providers must incur 
acquisitions and divestitures in november the company commenced operations simultaneously with the acquisition of eleven companies providing same day delivery and logistics services

to a limited degree  state and local authorities have the power to regulate the delivery of certain types of shipments and operations within certain geographic areas 
interstate and intrastate motor carrier operations are also subject to safety requirements prescribed by the united states department of transportation the dot and by state departments of transportation 
the company s failure to comply with the applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of one or more of the company s operating permits

in  a subsidiary of the company satisfactorily concluded an employment status examination 
the company has been informed that two additional examinations will be conducted in regarding employment status at certain other company subsidiaries 
the company continues to believe that the independent contractors utilized by the company are not employees under existing interpretations of federal and state laws

overview the consolidated financial statements of the company including all related notes which appear elsewhere in this report should be read in conjunction with this discussion of the company s results of operations and its liquidity and capital resources 
on december   the company entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of its fulfillment and direct mail business and thereby executed its previously announced plan to discontinue providing such services 
accordingly  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company s fulfillment and direct mail business have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s results in were impacted by the sale of its contract logistics subsidiary which accounted for million in revenue for and  to the date of its sale in january results of operations compared with revenue increased million  or  from million in to million for the year ended december  were it not for the decrease in revenue attributable to the sale of the contract logistics subsidiary  revenue would have reflected an increase of million  or  from million in to million for the year ended december  air courier revenue increased million  or and ground delivery revenue increased million  or for the year over the year air courier revenue benefited from the expansion and internal growth of existing accounts as well as the full year contribution of acquisitions made by the company during ground delivery revenue increased by million from the addition of time service and facilities management revenue as a result of previously disclosed acquisitions and the addition of several new contract distribution routes in the pharmaceutical  electronic repair and office products industries 
the increases in ground delivery revenue discussed above were offset by a decrease of million in the company s banking division due to continued industry consolidation 
two of the company s largest banking customers merged  decreasing their branch network and the number of stops required 
the company believes this upward trend in ground and air delivery revenue will continue in the future as a result of internal growth and its focus on selective and strategic acquisitions in while company management restricted its acquisition activity in  the goal for is to focus on selective and strategic acquisitions where the company can enhance current operations or expand into certain new market areas 
cost of revenue includes  among other things  payment to employee drivers  owner operators and independent contractors as well as agents  airfreight carriers  commercial airlines  and pick up and delivery fees 
these costs increased by million  or from million for the year to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue is due to several factors which include significant start up costs in connection with new contracts added in the pharmaceutical and office products distribution industries as well as an increase in costs necessary to support a growing revenue base in ground delivery 
the company was impacted early in by airline fuel surcharges as well as a change in the general business mix which reduced certain consolidation opportunities in selected air freight shipments in the company s major markets 
as a result of the above  gross profit increased by  or  from million for to million for the year ended december  excluding the effect on gross profit of the contract logistics subsidiary  gross profit would have increased by million or from million for to million for selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a includes salaries  sales commissions and travel to support the company s marketing and sales effort 
also included are the expenses of maintaining the company s information systems  human resources  financial  legal  procurement and other administrative functions 
s  g a decreased by million  or from million in to million in the sale of the company s contract logistics subsidiary accounts for million of that decrease 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a special charge of million which included contract and salary settlements  abandonment of operating leases and other costs associated with management headcount reduction and other consolidation issues 
the restructuring charge included in s  g a resulted in a net reduction of sg a costs of approximately  in the balance of the reduction is principally the result of reduced salaries at the operating regions due to continued internal consolidation 
as a result of the above  operating income increased for the year ended december  by million from a loss of million in to an operating profit of million in when excluding the results of the company s contract logistics subsidiary which was sold in early  operating income would have increased million 
the gain recognized by the company on the aforementioned sale of its contract logistics subsidiary in january amounted to  before applicable taxes 
interest expense increased by  from  in to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an overall increase in the level of borrowing by the company during as compared to to a lesser extent  the company was also subject to interest rate increases during the first quarter of with its previous lenders prior to the establishment of its current revolving credit facility see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
non comparability of results of operations compared to because the acquired companies operated as separate independent entities prior to their acquisition  comparisons between the consolidated results of the company for the year ended december  and the pro forma combined historical results of the acquired companies for the year ended december   are difficult to make for numerous reasons  including the following in  the acquired companies were all subsumed within the common management of the company 
this resulted among other things in a each subsidiary being subjected to an administrative charge  b reallocation of costs  such as  for instance  common insurance being acquired for the company and its subsidiaries as a whole  and c the subsidiaries being relieved of the necessity of performing various administrative functions for themselves 
in  the company began the process of merging and rationalizing operations of the previously unrelated acquired companies 
the company incurred approximately million in expenses during related to corporate overhead and the costs of operating as a public company  compared to approximately  in most of the acquired companies were operated as subchapter s corporations prior to their acquisition 
the selected financial data presented in this report includes the actual financial results of the company for the years ended december   and the pro forma combined historical results reflect the combined operations of the acquired companies for the period from january to september  and the results of operations of consolidated delivery logistics  inc and subsidiaries for the year ended december  for all the reasons set forth above and others  combined results are not indicative of results that would have been achieved if the acquired companies had actually been combined during those periods  and may not be comparable to or indicative of future performance 
nonetheless  the following section discusses consolidated results compared to pro forma combined historical results to indicate general trends affecting operations 
the following section should be read with the foregoing caveats as to non comparability in mind 
results of operations compared to consolidated delivery s revenue increased to million in from million in in spite of the loss of significant revenue in the company s contract logistics subsidiary  the company achieved revenue growth in all other areas of its business 
revenue in ground delivery  including rush  scheduled and distribution increased from million in to million in air courier produced a increase to million in from million in revenue in the company s logistics business declined by from million in to million in contract logistics revenue contributed to the overall decline in logistics revenues by million due to the cancellation and or non renewal of several long term contractual relationships 
the significant decline in contract logistics revenues during contributed to the company s decision to sell its contract logistics subsidiary early in ground delivery revenue benefited from the acquisition of three companies in the northeast during in  internal growth of the air courier business was augmented by the acquisition of two companies  which solidified and expanded the new york to los angeles air route 
the increase in cost of revenue during caused the company s gross profit percentage to decline from in to in among other factors contributing to the increase in cost of revenue is a change in the company s general business mix to lower margin business  mobilization and start up costs for several large distribution contracts and the effect of fuel surcharges from several air carriers
