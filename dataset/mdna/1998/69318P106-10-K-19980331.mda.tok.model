and its subsidiaries wells 
however  all financial information for periods ended before december   unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires  is for pcd inc and its subsidiaries  excluding wells 
overview pcd designs  manufactures and markets electronic connectors for use in integrated circuit ic package interconnect applications  industrial equipment and avionics 
electronic connectors  which enable an electrical current or signal to pass from one element to another within an electronic system  range from minute individual connections within an ic to rugged  multiple lead connectors that couple various types of electrical electronic equipment 
the company was founded in and the current chairman  john l 
dwight  jr  acquired a controlling interest in over the years  the company has made a number of strategic acquisitions and investments to both bolster existing product lines and expand into selected key markets

year ended december  pro forma product categories ic package interconnects industrial interconnects avionics terminal blocks and sockets total table gives effect to the wells acquisition assuming such transaction had occurred on january  wells acquisition on december   the company purchased wells the wells acquisition 
the acquisition significantly expanded the company s product offerings in the ic package interconnect category and added principal facilities in south bend  indiana and yokohama  japan  as well as technical support operations in regensburg  germany and penang  malaysia  sales offices in san jose  california  northhampton  england  seoul  south korea and singapore  and a stamping facility in harrisburg swatara  pennsylvania 
in combining the existing ic package interconnect business of pcd with that of wells  the company now supports complete design  development  manufacturing and marketing of test and burn in sockets in two of the world s largest ic package interconnect markets the united states and japan 
wells was acquired for access to its burn in technology and customer base 
the purchase price for wells was million in cash and the company incurred approximately million in acquisition related costs resulting in a total purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase in accordance with apb opinion no 
as a result  a purchase price premium of million was recorded on the transaction

the completion costs for these ipr d programs are expected to be approximately million 
the company intends to further develop the ipr d projects  and expects successful completion of a number of them 
however  the company recognizes that development of the ipr d possesses certain risks such as failure of one or more of the critical technologies to function according to specifications or customer rejection  which may directly impact these projects reaching technological feasibility 
the company expects the useful lives of the ipr d projects to be to years  if technological feasibility is reached 
if the ipr d projects were not successfully developed  it would negatively impact the future performance and the ability of the company s burn in socket segment to compete 
wells product development is highly focused and customer driven  and generally related to a specific product or next generation platform 
often  successful projects are able to be commercialized into major product lines  as demonstrated by recent sales results 
wells is in the process of developing significant next generation product programs with major customers 
prior to the acquisition of wells by the company  wells was a wholly owned subsidiary of siebe  having been purchased in may as part of siebe s strategic acquisition of unitech plc 
the stated objective of siebe s purchase of unitech was to combine the two companies power supply and control operations 
wells  a small non strategic and non core subsidiary of unitech  represented less than of the total purchase consideration 
subsequent to the acquisition by siebe  wells grew substantially and expanded its customer base  product lines and product development processes

years ended december  and december  net sales 
net sales increased to million for  from million for this change in net sales reflected increased market penetration of the company s ic package interconnects and industrial interconnects 
the greatest portion of this growth was derived from higher sales volume of the ic package sockets  particularly the ball grid array bga burn in sockets 
sales of this product family  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  grew to approximately million in from  in the industrial interconnect line was also favorably impacted by new product introductions 
sales of the high density terminal block line  which was introduced in late  grew to approximately  in from  in sales to customers located outside the united states  either directly or through us and foreign distributors  were of net sales in  compared with of net sales in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for  from million for as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased to for from for the increase in gross margin was attributable to a shift in product mix back to ic packaging interconnects from industrial interconnects and avionics terminal blocks and sockets  higher sales volume and cost improvements resulting from the company s continuous cost reduction program

gross profit increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased from in to for this decrease in gross margin was attributable to a shift in product mix from ic packaging interconnects to industrial interconnects and avionics terminal blocks and sockets and a one time expense for a design change to a nonstandard product in the ic package interconnect category 
this decline was partially offset by increased manufacturing and labor efficiencies resulting from higher sales volume and the best cost producer program 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased by  to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for this decrease in operating expenses is the result of having recorded professional fees in associated with pending patent litigation  partially offset by increased expenses in resulting from the company s status as a publicly traded company

inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold used in plating  copper and brass used for contacts  and plastic material used in molding connector components 
in the past  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to similarly offset such cost increases in the future 
year compliance costs many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
to distinguish st century dates from th century dates  these date code fields must be able to accept four digit entries 
the company utilizes a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems across its entire organization  including applications used in manufacturing  product development  financial business systems and various administrative functions 
the company believes that  with the exception of the south bend  indiana location of wells cti wells cti south bend  its computer systems will be able to manage and manipulate all material data involving the transition from to without functional or data abnormality and without inaccurate results related to such data 
however  there can be no assurances that potential systems interruptions or the cost necessary to update software would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or business

the company believes that  within the next nine months  it will have to replace the current systems at wells cti south bend with new systems that are year compliant 
failure to replace such systems could result in the generation of erroneous data or system failure 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with year compliance  and year issues involving systems of wells cti south bend could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or business 
the cost of replacing computer systems of wells cti south bend is currently estimated to be up to
