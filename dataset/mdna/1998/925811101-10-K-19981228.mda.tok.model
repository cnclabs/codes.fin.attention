the company is in the process of assessing the status of its principal suppliers year readiness and their plans to address problems that their computer systems may face in correctly processing date information as the year approaches 
however  since the ultimate success of the company s customers and suppliers to become compliant is largely outside of the company s control  no assurances can be made that the company will be unaffected by the year should the company s suppliers fail to achieve year compliance  the supply of product to the company may be interrupted resulting in possible lost revenue to the company due to its inability to supply finished product to its customers 
if such interruptions are prolonged  it could have a material adverse effect on the company

although the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen during  in past years the us dollar had weakened dramatically in relation to the yen  resulting in increased costs for such products

depending on market conditions  the company will enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency risk on these product purchases
