item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis mesa air group  inc and its subsidiaries mesa or the company are a group of regional airlines and related companies providing service across the united states as americawest express  mesa airlines  united express and us airways express 
the following tables set forth selected operating and financial data of mesa for the years indicated below operating data years ended september passengers    available seat miles    revenue passenger miles    load factor revenue per asm cent cent cent yield per rpm cent cent cent cost per asm cent cent cent financial data years ended september percent cost percent cost percent cost amount of per amount of per amount of per revenues asm revenues asm revenues asm flight operations  cent  cent  cent maintenance  cent  cent  cent aircraft and traffic servicing  cent  cent  cent promotion and sales  cent  cent  cent general and administrative  cent  cent  cent depreciation and amortization  cent  cent  cent other operating items  cent  cent total operating expenses  cent  cent  cent interest expense  cent  cent  cent revenue and expense comparison fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues increased by million percent for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in operating revenues is the result of a percent increase in passengers  partially offset by a percent decrease in average fares 
capacity  measured by available seat miles asms  increased by percent and passenger traffic measured by revenue passenger miles rpms which is one passenger carried one mile  increased by percent 
the load factor increased from percent to percent  yield passenger revenue per rpm decreased to cent in fiscal from cent per rpm  and revenue per asm increased to cent from cent per asm in fiscal the airline industry has a history of fare and traffic volatility 
management expects revenue per available seat mile to remain relatively stable in existing markets during the next fiscal year 
however  the crj jet aircraft  which is faster and flown over a longer stage length than turbo prop aircraft  generates lower revenue per asm than turbo prop aircraft 
because the company expects to operate increasing numbers of crj aircraft in the future  overall revenue per asm is expected to be lower in the fiscal year than that attained in fiscal flight operations expense increased by percent to million cent per asm for the fiscal year ended september   from million cent per asm for the year ended september  fuel costs increased by million to cent per asm from cent per asm during the current period as compared to the prior period 
of that increase  million is a result of a cent per gallon increase in the average price of fuel with increased usage accounting for the balance 
pilot costs increased by million during the year due primarily to a million increase in pilot wages and payroll taxes 
of this increase million was a result of increased rates of pay associated with the new pilot contract which became effective in december and million of the increase was due to an increase in the number of pilots employed 
the costs of pilot meals and lodging increased by million as a result of the new contract and conversion to operating under far part dispatch costs increased by million and pilot training costs rose by million in the period due to the stricter operating requirements of far part these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate million reduction in aircraft lease costs during the fiscal year which resulted from the purchase of aircraft in may  previously operated by mesa under operating leases 
aircraft ownership costs are reported as depreciation and interest expense rather than flight operations expense 
maintenance costs increased by million to million cent per asm for the fiscal year  from million cent per asm for the prior year 
the requirements of operating under far part  the associated new training requirements and implementation of the consent order with the federal aviation administration faa resulted in a percent increase in the number of mechanics per airplane in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in number of mechanics per aircraft and a wage increase granted to the mechanics resulted in increasing labor costs by approximately million during the fiscal year 
an increase in the number of aircraft engine overhauls resulted in an increase in engine overhaul expense of million percent 
aircraft and traffic servicing costs increased to million cent per asm during fiscal from million cent per asm in fiscal station labor costs rose by million due to an across the board wage increase granted in september in order to attract and retain qualified individuals 
non completion costs increased by million in fiscal the increase was caused by a higher than normal level of flight cancellations as a result of flight crew scheduling difficulties and training delays 
the flight crew scheduling difficulties and training delays were related to the significant changes required by conversion to far part and compliance with the faa consent order 
deicing costs increased 
million and security expenses increased 
million in over the prior year 
increased costs of security are directly related to the increase in passengers carried 
promotion and sales expense increased slightly from million to million 
general and administrative costs declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was reduced management compensation expense under the management incentive program 
depreciation and amortization expense rose by million to million and interest expense increased by million to million 
the increase in depreciation and interest expense was due to the purchase of aircraft in may  which had previously been operated by mesa under operating leases  and the purchase of new beechcraft aircraft financed with debt 
at september   the company recognized a provision of million for the non renewal of the westair  and potential early termination of the mai  code sharing agreements with ual 
this provision is included in other operating items 
see footnotes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the million provision provides for the estimated loss on the retirement or sale of aircraft  parts and equipment which are expected to be surplus to the needs of the company upon expiration or potential early termination of the code sharing agreements 
in addition  the provision includes an estimate for all other anticipated costs of discontinuation or sale of the westair  denver and pacific northwest operations 
other operating items in fiscal also includes a gain from the settlement with an aircraft manufacturer of million and a million aircraft return provision related to the final settlement and return of the company s fokker aircraft 
in fiscal  the company recognized a million provision related to return of the fokker aircraft 
the company s effective tax rate of is comparable with prior years 
fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues increased million percent for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in operating revenues is the result of a six percent increase in passengers and a four percent increase in average fares 
capacity  measured by available seat miles asms  increased by percent 
the load factor increased from percent to percent and revenue per asm increased from cent to cent 
the airline industry has a history of fare and traffic volatility  however  management expects revenue per available seat mile to remain relatively stable during the next fiscal year 
flight operations expense decreased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in primarily due to a reduction of fleet integration costs during the current year  a conversion of many aircraft from being operated under operating lease to owned aircraft  and the operation of jet aircraft throughout the entire fiscal year 
however  this benefit was partially offset by higher than average pilot training costs in the third and fourth quarters caused by the increased turnover caused by major airlines increased hiring of mesa pilots and an increase in fuel related to a new tax on jet fuel and a general increase in price 
maintenance expense was essentially unchanged at cent per asm in aircraft and traffic servicing cost increased slightly from cent per asm in to cent per asm in this increase is primarily the result of increased operating fees at denver international airport 
these costs include landing fees  station wages  rent and other station costs 
promotion and sales expense decreased slightly from cent in to cent per asm in these costs include commissions  booking fees and other reservation costs and will vary with revenue 
general and administrative expense remained constant at cent per asm 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in primarily due to additional depreciation on owned aircraft 
interest expense increased from cent per asm in to cent per asm in as a result of financing more aircraft through use of debt rather than operating leases 
mesa incurred an effective tax rate of approximately percent for the year this rate is lower than due in part to implementation of a state tax minimization program 
the combination of the above factors  excluding a one time accrual for fokker return costs of cent per asm  resulted in a slight increase in operating expenses from cent per asm in to cent per asm in liquidity and capital resources mesa s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of september  amounted to million 
this was an increase of million over the prior year 
mesa generated approximately million in cash from operating activities during mesa s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are intended to be used for working capital  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
mesa had receivables of approximately million at september  which consist primarily of amounts due from code sharing partners ual and us airways 
under the terms of the ual and us airways agreements  mesa receives a substantial portion of its revenues through the airline clearing house 
historically  mesa has generated adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs 
management s belief that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs is a forward looking statement 
actual cash flow could materially differ from the forward looking statement in the event of the termination of one or more code sharing agreements  a substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to mai under its code sharing agreement with ual or us airways  termination of one or more of the company s credit facilities resulting in the need to repay unanticipated debt  reduced levels of passenger revenue  additional taxes or costs of compliance with governmental regulations  fuel cost increases  increase in competition  increase in interest rates  general economic conditions and unfavorable settlement of existing or potential litigation 
at september   mesa had a line of credit with a bank of million which was being utilized solely to secure outstanding letters of credit 
an aggregate ceiling of million applies to the letters of credit issued under this agreement  of which million were outstanding at september  should mesa draw upon this line of credit  an interest rate of libor plus percent percent will apply 
the line matures on march   and bears an annual fee of percent 
as of september   mesa was not in compliance with certain debt covenants of the line of credit agreement  however the bank has waived compliance with such covenants 
certain loan and debt agreements with banks contain covenants which require mesa to maintain or exceed stated levels of net worth and to equal or exceed specified debt and working capital ratios 
as of september   mesa was not in compliance with certain of these financial ratio covenants with total borrowings of million which have been classified as current portion of long term debt in the accompanying balance sheet 
in january  certain other financial ratio covenants were either waived or amended effective september  the company believes it will be in compliance with either its present covenants or amended covenants through september  except for the aforementioned borrowings of million which has been classified as current portion of long term debt 
the company s belief that it will be in compliance with its covenants or amended covenants is a forward looking statement and its compliance could be impacted by the costs further described herein related to restructuring the company s operations and the timing and sale of aircraft 
mesa has significant operating lease obligations on existing aircraft 
at september   mesa leased aircraft with remaining terms of up to years 
future lease payments due under all aircraft operating leases were approximately million at september  as previously reported  the company gave notice to bombardier regional aircraft division brad of its decision to exercise an option to cancel five dash aircraft on order and cancel delivery of the eight remaining previously ordered dash aircraft because of production delays and initial operating reliability issues 
the company had originally ordered of the seat  turboprop aircraft 
long term financing for all dash aircraft delivered and placed in service has been completed 
on august   the company reached an agreement with brad providing for conversion of the remaining eight dash aircraft on order into orders for eight canadair regional jet crj aircraft 
in august  mesa entered into a memorandum of understanding with brad to acquire crj passenger jet aircraft with options to acquire an additional of the jet aircraft 
in august  mesa announced that it would exercise options for of its option aircraft reserved under the option agreement including the conversion of eight of its dash aircraft then on order to crj passenger jet aircraft 
the order for aircraft totals approximately million 
mesa has an million deposit with brad relating to this order 
this deposit will increase to million by september  eleven crj aircraft had been delivered to mesa by december  the company expects to receive nine more crj aircraft in and the remaining jets are scheduled to be delivered in the company has an agreement to trade in embraer brasilia emb aircraft to brad on a one for one basis for the crj aircraft being acquired from brad 
eight of the emb trade in aircraft were originally traded in on the eight dash aircraft order which were subsequently converted into orders for crj aircraft 
all emb aircraft are required to be in airworthy condition under mesa s maintenance program at the time of the trade in 
mesa has committed to maintain the trade in emb aircraft on its maintenance program until such aircraft are sold or released to another operator 
as of december   emb s have been delivered to brad 
should the company fail to receive favorable financing terms from third parties on the ordered crj aircraft to be delivered to the company  the company has the right to obtain financing for the crj aircraft from brad  subject to the company meeting certain creditworthiness standards 
approximately million was incurred as a one time expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the two fokker aircraft returned by the company to daimler benz 
on january   one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  fca  inc  entered into a distributorship agreement the distributor agreement with sino swearingen aircraft company  l 
p 
ssac for the distribution of corporate jets 
the distributor agreement requires fca to maintain a retail sales area  hangar and maintenance facility  with appropriate staff  an adequate supply of spare parts at a general aviation airport strategically located within fca s distribution area  and certain other requirements 
the company is subject to an annual minimum purchase requirement to be adjusted by ssac and the company on an annual basis 
the initial annual purchase requirement was three aircraft 
fca has agreed to purchase eight aircraft from ssac with delivery dates beginning in the first quarter of and ending in the first quarter of the current purchase price of each aircraft is approximately million and is subject to change by ssac 
fca is required to make progress payments to ssac on each aircraft as follows upon execution of the purchase agreement   days prior to delivery date   days prior to delivery date   at delivery  approximately million based upon the current purchase price reduced by the distributors profit 
in total  fca is presently obligated to purchase eight aircraft for approximately million at current prices 
fca is also obligated to purchase an adequate supply of parts to support aircraft sold in the distribution area 
in february  fca made progress payments of  to ssac against its purchase order for eight aircraft 
the chief executive officer of ssac  mr 
jack braly  is a member of the board of directors of mesa air group  inc see  item  certain relationships and related transactions 
the company has negotiated year engine maintenance contracts with general electric aircraft engines ge for the crj and with pratt and whitney  canada aircraft services pwc for the dash aircraft 
the ge engine maintenance contract provides coverage for the engines on the first crj aircraft to be delivered 
the company is presently negotiating with ge to add the crj aircraft engines for additional crj aircraft to this maintenance contract 
the pwc contract provides coverage for all dash aircraft engines operated by the company 
both contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair event and a fixed dollar amount per flight hour  subject to escalation based on changes in the cpi  for the number of flight hours incurred since the previous event 
as a result of a special review by the faa of mesa s operations  a consent order was signed with the faa in september  assessing a compromise civil penalty of  mesa paid  of the compromise amount  and the remaining  was waived in september upon mesa s compliance with provisions of the consent order 
company management is monitoring the extent of new costs imposed on its and seat aircraft operations by the implementation of the additional operating procedures required by far part and the consent order 
at present  management believes the continuing costs of implementing the new operating procedures required by far part and the consent order approximate million per annum 
the million of increased costs are primarily related to additional training  dispatch and maintenance procedures 
the ongoing costs estimates to comply with far part regulations and the consent order are forward looking statements that involve a number of uncertainties which could cause actual costs to differ materially from the forward looking statements including  among other factors  promulgation of future faa regulations  administrative rules  or informal requests by the faa requiring the hiring of additional personnel  addition of new aircraft mechanical equipment  payment of additional fines and the impact of future laws or congressional investigations all of which could have the effect of increasing the costs of compliance 
in connection with the million loss provision for the fiscal year ended september   the company believes that it will incur approximately to million in cash expenditures in fiscal primarily as a result of the costs to be incurred for disposition of the surplus aircraft  severance and other expenditures 
the estimated cash expenditure is a forward looking statement which is subject to change caused by  among other factors  the timing  sale and relocation of aircraft  employee severance and relocation costs  and other costs related to the company s restructuring of its operations 
mesa does not expect any material negative impact to its operations as a result of inflation 
mesa believes fares and fee per departure rates  and accordingly revenues  can be changed to offset the impact of inflation 
at september   approximately percent of the company s million of indebtedness was at fixed rates 
however  million of the total debt converts from fixed to variable interest rates upon the seventh anniversary of the delivery date of the financed aircraft and may be affected by inflation if such inflation results in an increase in interest rates 
management s belief that inflation will have no material negative impact on the company is a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements due to general economic factors which cannot be foreseen or controlled by mesa and its management 
management of the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failure 
to date the company has not completed its analysis of the potential year risk and therefore the cost to the company as a result of year software has not been fully determined
