item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general during the past two fiscal years  the company s revenues increased at a compound annual rate of to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september   and its operating income increased at a compound annual rate of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s recent growth has been generated almost exclusively by increasing the number of terminals operated by the company and growth in revenue produced by existing terminals 
since october   it has added terminals  increasing the total to at september  at that date  of these terminals had been open less than months 
the company plans to continue to expand its terminal network 
the company currently plans to open terminals in approximately additional cities in fiscal such plans  however  are subject to change based on a variety of factors 
the company may complement its internal expansion with selective acquisitions 
the opening of a new terminal generally has an initial negative impact on the company s profitability due to operating losses of the new terminal 
the opening of a new terminal generally does not require significant capital expenditures 
additionally  personnel costs are contained at the time of the opening of a new terminal because commissions are generally not paid until salesmen achieve minimum sales levels and until managers achieve terminal profitability 
although future new terminals may be opened in cities smaller than those in which the company s more mature terminals are located  the company believes the results of new terminals should benefit from a ready base of business provided by its existing customers 
the company intends to continue to expand its international freight forwarding business 
international shipments typically generate higher revenues per shipment than domestic shipments 
the company anticipates that the costs of transportation for international freight will be higher than for domestic freight as a percentage of such revenues  resulting in lower gross margins than domestic shipments  however  the company does not expect its operating expenses to increase in proportion to such revenues 
in april  the company expanded its international operations through the acquisition of the operations of eagle transfer  inc and of s 
boardman air services limited 
the company also intends to continue the growth of its local pick up and delivery operations 
by providing local pick up and delivery services with respect to shipments for which it is the freight forwarder  the company has been able to increase its gross margin with respect to such shipments because it captures margins which were previously paid to third parties 
however  the company s local pick up and delivery services provided to other non forwarding customers generate a lower gross margin than the company s domestic forwarding operations due to their higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues 
effective october   eagle elected to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of certain state tax laws 
from october  until the termination of its s corporation status  the company paid no federal income tax 
for financial reporting purposes  for periods prior to the company s initial public offering  eagle recorded a provision for state income taxes for all states in which it operated 
the company also has recorded for fiscal the federal income tax liability for each of its subsidiaries  which had paid federal income taxes 
shortly prior to the initial public offering in december  eagle s status as an s corporation was terminated  and for periods thereafter  eagle has been liable for federal income taxes and state income taxes in certain states 
prior to the closing of the initial public offering  eagle declared distributions payable both in cash and in the form of special distribution notes in an amount equal to all of eagle s undistributed s corporation earnings up through such closing 
the final payment of these notes was made in fiscal the company has no plans to pay any dividends or distributions in the foreseeable future 
on october   the company purchased a interest in eagle freight services  inc and c d freight services of california  inc 
from a third party and  during fiscal purchased a interest in freight services management  inc from the company s chairman of the board and initiated operation of eagle usa transportation services  inc and eagle usa import brokers  inc the eagle subsidiaries 
the remaining interests in the eagle subsidiaries were purchased from the company s chairman of the board immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering in december because eagle controlled the eagle subsidiaries  results for fiscal reflect the operations of all of the eagle subsidiaries as if they had been owned by the company as of the beginning of the period presented 
the company has experienced significant growth primarily through increases in sales at existing terminals and opening new terminals 
in september the company completed the acquisition of the assets of a columbus  ohio transportation provider and in april completed acquisitions of operations primarily servicing south america and the united kingdom 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company anticipates that its growth strategy in the future will include internal growth in its domestic and international freight forwarding  local pick up and delivery and truck brokerage business  and could also include additional acquisitions 
the company s ability to continue its growth will depend on a number of factors  including existing and emerging competition  the ability to open new terminals  the ability to maintain profit margins in the face of competitive pressures  the continued recruitment  training and retention of operating and management employees  the strength of demand for its services and the availability of capital to support such growth and the ability to identify  negotiate and fund acquisitions when appropriate 
international operations are likely to involve increased costs and risks including those related to foreign regulation  intensified competition  currency fluctuations and exchange controls 
acquisitions involve risks  including those relating to the integration of acquired business  retention of prior levels of business  retention of employees  diversion of management attention  amortization of acquired intangible assets  unexpected liabilities and other problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing any of its business strategy or plans for future growth 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
disclosure of information about capital structure for all periods ending after december  sfas no 
contains no changes in the disclosure requirements of the company because it was previously subject to such requirements pursuant to other statements and opinions 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of the enterprise and related information 
the adoption of both statements is required for the company s fiscal year ending september  under sfas no 
 companies are required to report in the financial statements  in addition to net income  comprehensive income including  as applicable  foreign currency items  minimum pension liability adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas requires that companies report separately  in the financial statements  certain financial and descriptive information about operating segments  if applicable 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
or sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

the number of shipments increased in part attributable to an increased number of smaller shipments during the ups strike and the total weight of cargo shipped increased over fiscal for those terminals open as of the beginning of fiscal  revenues increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues for fiscal were comprised of million of forwarding revenues  million of local pick up and delivery revenues and million of other freight forwarding revenues

cost of transportation increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was the result of several factors 
for the period october to may  several of the company s transportation providers implemented a fuel surcharge which was not in effect during fiscal increased revenues from international freight which generally have lower gross margins than domestic shipments  which were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  also contributed to the higher cost of transportation as a percentage of revenues 
additionally  the reinstatement on march  of the federal air cargo transportation excise tax the federal excise tax  which had previously expired january   negatively impacted cost of transportation as a percentage of revenues for the year

the company estimates that the ups strike resulted in approximately million in incremental revenue which generated approximately after tax profit on such revenue 
the strike had a slightly positive impact on gross profit margin as the increased traffic from the strike carried higher yields on a per pound basis 
the strike  however  resulted in higher operating expenses primarily personnel costs which offset these higher yields 
the company does not expect to retain any of the business it gained through the ups strike  as the two companies generally occupy separate niches within the freight transportation marketplace

year issues the securities and exchange commission has published guidance regarding the effect of year issues on companies 
the year or yk problem arose because some computer programs use only the last two digits of a year to refer to a date  causing them to not properly recognize a year that does not begin with 
the company has completed its initial assessment of possible exposure of yk issues 
the company believes that its primary operating and accounting information systems are and have always been compliant with the century factor 
to date  the company has not identified any non information technology systems that use embedded technology on which it relies 
based upon the company s assessment of its relationships with vendors  suppliers  customers and banks  the company is not aware of situations where material disruptions of its business activities are likely to occur because of year non compliance by third parties 
the company s assessment of its year issues involves many assumptions 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove accurate  and actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions 
in conducting its year compliance efforts  the company has relied primarily on representations from third parties with which the company has business relationships  and has not independently verified these representations 
with respect to the company s internal systems  the company has conducted tests of its critical processes 
there can be no assurance that these representations will prove accurate or that the tests have been subjected to a sufficient sample of conditions 
a year failure could result in a business disruption that adversely effects the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  if a year failure causes insufficient air lift to be available to the company  the company s air freight forwarding operations would be curtailed and the company might also be unable to provide sufficient alternative services such as ground  rail or ocean cargo capacity to meets is expected levels of operations 
there can be no assurance that the global transportation industry and regulatory authorities  including but not limited to the united states department of transportation and related agencies  will not be affected in a way that negatively affects the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company is unable to determine the potential business interruption costs which might be incurred as a result of yk issues  including the costs if the cargo capacity of airline  trucks  rail and ocean vessels is insufficient to meet the company s then operating requirements in any of its geographic regions 
the company is currently exploring risk management alternatives with respect to possible business interruption which may result if certain of the company s critical vendors and suppliers are not ready for the yk problem by january  and it is expected that such plans will continue through the year the company s internal yk assessment is largely complete  however  the company s assessment of yk issues caused by its relationships with third parties is expected to continue until and through the year the company has not to date expended and does not currently plan to expend any significant amount of funds for yk issues 
despite the company s assessment to date  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect that the yk issues will have on the company 
seasonality historically  the company s operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the second quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the fourth quarter has traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s terminal network 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and  as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company currently does not have any outstanding short term or long term debt instruments as of september  accordingly  the company does not have market risk related to interest rates 
the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as it relates to the earnings of its united kingdom  canada and mexico subsidiaries  as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
at september   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which these subsidiaries are denominated would not have a material impact on operating income for the year ending september  the company does not purchase futures contracts nor does it purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
