historically  revenues in the first quarter have been lower than in the preceding fourth quarter due to customer budgeting and purchasing patterns 
the company s results of operations have been and may in the future be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to a variety of factors  including the timing of significant orders  the timing of the introduction or announcement of new or enhanced products by the company or its competitors  variations in net revenue by product and distribution channel  increased price and other competition  capital spending patterns of end users  delays in shipping new or existing products  conditions within the software and networking industries  and economic conditions generally 
revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of as a result of the management agreement

at december  and  the company did not have an outstanding balance under the line of credit agreement 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was thousand  thousand  and million  respectively 
in  net cash used in operating activities consisted of million of net income from operations  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to new product introductions  increased stocking levels as a result of increased revenue and related unit shipments  and procedures put in place by the company during to help ensure more complete availability of product in stock 
in  net cash used in operating activities consisted of million net loss from operations which was the result of a million charge for purchased incomplete research and development relating to the acquisitions of leprechaun software international  ltd  netrend corporation and the lan software business from technocom  plc  a million charge for asset write down related to restructure charges  depreciation and amortization of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and increase in prepaid assets of million

the company believes that its existing cash balances  funds generated from operations  and available borrowings under its line of credit will be sufficient to finance the company s operations through december in the event the company acquires one or more businesses or products  the company s capital requirements could increase substantially  and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
certain factors that may affect future results some statements contained in this form k that are not historical statements including but not limited to  statements concerning estimates of future revenues  operating expense levels and such operating expense levels relative to the company s total revenues constitute forward looking statements under the safe harbour provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following risk factors  among other factors including the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense level and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results stated in such forward looking statements 
change in marketing strategy historically  the company has marketed all of its products other than the comprehensive client management ccm products through its free trial marketing system 
pursuant to the elron transaction  the company sold  among other things  its free trial marketing system  subject to a limited license back to the company 
this license will allow the company to continue to use the free trial marketing system to market its current groupware products  including future versions and feature extensions of such products  to existing customers and identified potential customers  for a period of three years from the closing date of the elron transaction the closing date  subject to termination in the event of a sale of the groupware products or a sale of all or substantially all of the company s business or assets 
although the company retains limited rights to the free trial marketing system  the company s ability to implement a marketing strategy based on the free trail marketing system has been severely curtailed because the company no longer has the personnel and infrastructure necessary to support such a strategy 
moreover  the company has made the strategic decision to limit its groupware marketing efforts to exclusively selling new seats to its existing customer base  while focusing the majority of its management  financial and technical resources on its enterprise desktop management products 
ccm product marketing strategy the target market for the ccm products is entirely different from the target market for the products the company has marketed and sold through its free trial marketing system 
the target market for ccm products consists primarily of large corporations such as deutsche telekom and munich reinsurance both existing ccm customers 
in addition  ccm product sales per customer are generally in the range of  to  as opposed to an average sale per customer for the company s groupware products of approximately  sales of ccm products pose significantly greater financial risks  and require greater up front investments in marketing  technical and financial resources  than sales of the company s historical products 
as a result  the company is adopting a new and untested marketing strategy using a direct sales force and in field service organization 
this marketing strategy requires significant investments in additional marketing and technical personnel  retraining of existing personnel  ongoing product development and creation of an in field service organization 
to date  substantially all of the company s marketing of ccm products has been in europe 
while the company has developed valuable experience and expertise in europe  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to transfer such experience and expertise to the north american market 
as a result of the elron transaction  the company will rely on fewer large customers for its revenue since the target market for ccm products is primarily large corporations 
currently  only one customer accounts for more than of the company s net revenue 
for the twelve months ended december   deutsche telekom accounted for million  or of net revenue from the company s current products 
it is possible that the company s change in marketing strategy will result in other customers accounting for more than of the company s net revenues 
technological requirements of the ccm products  product development the technological demands of the ccm products require a commitment of significant ongoing financial  technical and personnel resources to product development  training of service technicians and customer training 
because the company s historical products were not as technologically demanding as the ccm products  the company has not to date made the required investment and has not proven that it can develop and maintain the organization required to support such products 
the company believes that its experience with the ccm products in europe will provide a valuable base on which to build the necessary financial  technical and personnel resources to sell  market  develop and support the ccm products in north america  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to expand and develop its resources to support ccm products in north america 
the ccm product is typically larger and more complex than the products that the company has previously developed 
the company s ability to continue to enhance the ccm product to meet customer and market requirements will depend substantially on its ability to effectively manage its development effort  to attract and retain the required development personnel in cambridge  massachusetts and starnberg  germany and to coordinate and manage geographically remote development efforts 
financial resources required by the ccm products the company has estimated that the product development  marketing and sales costs of the ccm products are approximately to million per month 
the company believes that it has sufficient financial resources to fund these costs through at least december there can be no assurance that the company s estimate of the marketing  sales and product development costs of the ccm products will prove correct  that such costs will not increase beyond the company s available financial resources  or that additional sources of capital  if and when needed  will be sufficient or available 
rapid technological change the groupware and enterprise desktop management software markets are characterized by rapid technological developments  changes in customer requirements  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend  in part  unpon its ability to enhance its existing applications  develop and introduce new products that take advantage of technological advances  and respond promptly to new customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
as discussed above  the company has made a strategic decision to limit its groupware marketing efforts to exclusively selling new seats to its existing customer base 
the company has identified a number of enhancements to ccm which it believes are important to its continued success in the enterprise desktop management software market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis  enhancements to its existing products or new products  or that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
failure by the company in any of these areas could materially and adversely affect the company s business  condition financial and otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
in addition  from time to time the company or its competitors may announce new products with capabilities or technology that could have a potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products or render such products obsolete 
there can be no assurance that announcements by the company or its competitors of new products will not cause customers to defer purchasing the company s existing products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future changes in dos  windows  windows nt  unix  netware or other popular operating systems would not result in incompatibility with the company s products 
the company s failure to introduce new products on a timely basis that are compatible with operating systems and environments preferred by desktop customer users would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to increase in the future 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for its products include performance  functionality  ease of use  ease of installation  quality  customer support  breadth or product line  speed of product delivery  frequency of upgrades and updates  brand name recognition  company reputation  adherence to industry standards  integration with third party solutions and price 
certain of the criteria upon which the performance and quality of the company s groupware software compete includes speed of response  ease of use  ease of installation  interoperability with other messaging systems and simplicity of administration 
the company believes that it generally competes favorably with repect to each of these factors  howver  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
certain of the company s cometitors have been in the market longer than the company  and other competitors are larger and may have greater name recognition that the company 
as is the case in many segments of the software industry  the company may encounter increasing price competition in the future 
this could reduce average selling prices and  therefore  profit margins 
competitive pressures could result not only in sustained price reductions but also in a decline in sales volume  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively against existing and potential competitors in these markets  many of whom have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and support resources and name recognition than the company 
the groupware  network management and security and client management software markets are highly fragmented  with products offered by many vendors 
in the e mail market  the company competes with offerings from software  shareware and freeware developers 
shareware is software that is made available electronically on bulletin boards systems 
shareware users are encouraged to evaluate the software for a short period of time and then either cease using it or pay a license fee 
in the group scheduling market  the company also competes with personal information manager products pims that have been enhanced to include some group scheduling features 
in addition  the trend toward enterprise wide communications software solutions may result in a consolidation of the communications software market around a smaller number of vendors who are able to provide all of the necessary software and support capabilities 
in the client management market  the company faces competition from large and established companies  such as microsoft  intel and ibm tivoli  which offer client management capabilities as part of their systems  network and or desktop management systems 
moreover  microsoft has announced the zero administration initiative for windows zaw  which includes a set of technologies that address some of the same client management issues as ccm 
microsoft has described components of zaw as being available for future versions of the windows nt and windows operating systems  as well as the microsoft systems management server product 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to compete effectively against client management software which is included free with operating system software 
see business competition 
product development the company has in the past experienced delays in software development  and there can be no assurance that it will not experience further delays in connection with its current or future product development activities 
the company puts all of its products through alpha and beta test cycles and makes significant efforts to debug all products before commercial release 
the company makes well marked alpha and beta versions of its software available for evaluation and testing and solicits and responds to input from evaluators 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not contain undetected errors or version compatibility issues  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
delays and difficulties associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
in addition to developing new products  the company s internal development staff is focused on developing upgrades and updates to existing products and modifying  enhancing and completing any acquired products and incomplete projects 
future enhancements may  among other things  include additional functionality  respond to user problems or address issues of compatibility with changing operating systems and environments 
failure to release such enhancements on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
if the company believes that a licensed product continues to be valuable after the expiration of the initial license term  it will seek to extend the term of the license 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend the term of expiring licenses  or that the economic arrangements for such extensions would be comparable to the arrangements in effect during the initial license term 
inclusion of ccm and groupware in system software and application suites in the future  vendors of operating system software and applications sold for a single price generally referred to as application suites may continue to enhance their products to include certain functions that are currently provided most often by ccm and groupware software or may bundle these products in their application suites at no additional charge 
the widespread inclusion of the functions provided by the company s products as standard features of operating system software could  particularly if the quality of such functions were comparable to that of the company s products  render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
furthermore  even if the ccm and groupware software functions provided as standard features by operating systems are more limited than those of the company s products  there is no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept such functions in lieu of purchasing additional software 
if the company were unable to develop new ccm and groupware software products to further enhance operating systems and to replace successfully any obsolete products  the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
potential acquisitions the company may in the future undertake additional acquisitions that could present challenges to the company s management  such as integrating and incorporating new operations  product lines  technologies and personnel 
if the company s management is unable to manage these challenges  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
any acquisition  depending on its size  could result in significant dilution to the company s stockholders 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any acquired products will gain acceptance in the company s markets 
past acquisitions the company has in the past made a number of acquisitions that have been and are being integrated and incorporated into the company s operations  along with the acquired product lines  technologies and personnel 
if the company s management is unable to continue to manage these challenges  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that any acquired products will gain acceptance in the company s markets 
indirect channels of distribution the company markets its products other than on command ccm through distributors and resellers in addition to its direct sales force 
these distributors and resellers also sell other products that are complementary to  or compete with  those of on 
there can be no assurance that these distributors and resellers will not give greater priority to products of other suppliers 
they have no long term obligation to purchase products from the company 
since the company s agreements with its distributors provide for a right of return  revenue recognized upon sales to distributors is subject to a reserve for returns 
although management believes that the current reserve balance is adequate to cover this exposure  there can be no assurance that any future period reserves for returns will be adequate 
in addition  the company may be unaware of the nature and scope of the representations made to customers by these distributors and resellers 
for example  they could make representations to customers about the company s current and future products which are inaccurate or incomplete 
this could result in the products not meeting the customers expectations or requirements 
although the company s agreements with its distributors generally provide the company with recourse against unauthorized action taken by the distributors  there can be no assurance that the company could recover adequate compensation to cover the damage caused by an inaccurate representation 
proprietary technology the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets and copyrights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its software 
the company uses a printed shrink wrap license for users of its groupware products distributed through traditional distribution channels in order to protect its copyrights and trade secrets in those products 
since these shrink wrap licenses are not signed by the licensee  many authorities believe that they may not be enforceable under many state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
if such licenses are not enforceable  the user would not be bound by the terms thereof  including the terms which seek to protect the company s proprietary technology 
if the printed shrink wrap licenses prove to be unenforceable  this may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
the company has signed license agreements from users of its enterprise desktop management products to protect its copyrights and trade secrets in those products 
the licenses may not be enforceable under some state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
if such licenses are not enforceable  the user would not be bound by the terms thereof  including the terms which seek to protect the company s proprietary technology 
if the signed license agreements prove to be unenforceable  this may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect the company s proprietary rights or offer only limited protection for those rights 
furthermore  in countries with a high incidence of software piracy  the company may experience a higher rate of piracy of its products 
the company has obtained registrations in the united states for the following trademarks on technology  notework  meeting maker  on technology design  on location  instant update and davinci systems 
the company has filed for the trademark on command ccm in the united states  the european community  canada and australia 
the company has obtained only four foreign registrations of its notework mark and two foreign registrations of its meeting maker mark  due to significant costs involved in obtaining foreign registrations 
as a result  the company may not be able to prevent a third party from using its trademarks in many foreign jurisdictions 
the company has not to date registered any of its copyrights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary software technology will be adequate to deter misappropriation of this technology 
lesser sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to avoiding copyright infringement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operation 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights of technology companies  although  to date  the company has not been subject to any such litigation 
although the company does not believe that it is infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as the company may acquire or license a portion of the software included in its future products from third parties  its exposure to infringement actions may increase because the company must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of any software being acquired 
the company generally obtains representations as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software and generally obtains indemnification to cover any breach of such representations 
however  there can be no assurance that such representations are accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for a breach of such representations 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect trade secrets and other intellectual property rights owned by the company 
the company may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and cause diversion of management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company could be subjected to lawsuits by customers  past  present or future  and others due to possible errors in the company s software 
the company is not aware of any material errors in its software or any pending or threatened litigation 
the company maintains insurance covering such liabilities in the amounts of million domestically and million internationally 
the company believes that its insurance coverages are sufficient to cover any such losses 
international revenue in fiscal and  total revenue from international licenses license revenue from outside the united states represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company expects that international revenue will constitute a significantly greater portion of the company s total revenue in accordingly  a greater percentage of the company s total revenue will be subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on demand for its products  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown of european business activity in the third quarter and tariffs and other trade barriers 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international license revenue 
loss of key management personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key technical and management employees 
while the company s employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  the employees  with the exception of messrs 
herman delatte  loren platzman  john bogdan and edward green  are generally not otherwise subject to employment agreements or noncompetition covenants 
the loss of the services of any of the company s key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operation 
the company does not maintain life insurance policies on key employees 
the company s success also depends in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition in the software industry for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel and in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires 
groupware business the company has made the strategic decision to limit its groupware marketing efforts to exclusively selling new seats to its existing customer base  while focusing the majority of its management  financial and technical resources on the ccm products 
the company believes that in the short term the company can significantly reduce the costs associated with the groupware products while continuing to generate cash flow from the sale of these products 
however  there can be no assurance that cash flow from the sale of the groupware products will not decrease faster than expected 
in addition  over the longer term  the company s strategic decision to cease marketing the groupware products to new customers will lead to an erosion of the customer base and a reduction of revenue from such products 
the company s ability to attract and retain the employees needed to service the groupware products may be materially adversely affected by the company s strategic decision to de emphasize the groupware products 
any loss of revenue from the groupware products may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operation 
strategic reorganization on july   the company reorganized and restructured its operations 
on october   additional restructuring actions were implemented 
these actions were designed to focus the company on the ccm business 
to date  the implementation of this new corporate strategy has included hiring a new chief executive officer  electing a new chairman of the board of directors  de emphasizing the acquisition of new customers in the company s groupware and network management and security business  discontinuing sales of the company s virus protection software  closing or reducing the company s offices in sydney  australia  paris  france  london  united kingdom  and munich  germany while building up the company s office in starnberg  germany and laying off approximately employees 
there can be no assurance that the company s new corporate strategy will be successfully implemented 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will not engage in further reorganizations or restructurings in the future 
variability of quarterly operating results the company s licensing activity and results of operations can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
causes of such fluctuations may include  among other factors the volume and timing of new and repeat orders  the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements by on or third parties  failure to ship trials  changes in response rates to the company s mailings and telemarketing programs  interruption in the company s overnight delivery  telephone or internal networks and databases  work stoppages  changes in product prices  changes in operating expenses  changes in product mix  increase in international sales as a percentage of total revenue  seasonality  trends in the computer industry  unavailability of product  potential software viruses and perceived threats thereof  customer order deferrals  general economic conditions  extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation and the occurrence of unexpected events 
while to date  the company has not experienced any work stoppages or unavailability of products  there can be no assurance any of such events will not occur in the future 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
because of the nature of its distribution methods for its groupware  the company has virtually no backlog with respect to such products and generally cannot predict when users will license such products 
as a result of the longer enterprise sales and product roll out cycle for ccm  the company will be better able to assess anticipated customer orders for ccm 
historically  repeat orders have accounted for a significant portion of the company s total revenue  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain current repeat order rates in the future  especially after consummation of the proposed transaction and in light of the de emphasis in marketing efforts for the groupware and network management and security products 
furthermore  since the company s cost of total revenue is relatively low and its operating expenses are relatively fixed  any revenue shortfall in a quarter will result in a substantially similar shortfall in net income 
in addition  significant quarterly fluctuations in licensing activity will cause significant fluctuations in the company s cash flows and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and deferred revenue accounts on the company s balance sheet 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality  due in part to customer buying patterns 
in recent years  the company generally has had greater demand for its products in the fourth quarter and has had weaker demand for its products during the first quarter 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer budgeting and purchasing patterns 
the company believes this pattern will continue 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
volatility of stock price the trading price of the company s common stock has been  and in the future may be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to actual or anticipated quarterly operating results of the company  announcements of technological innovations or new applications by the company or its competitors and general market conditions in the software industry  as well as other events or factors 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of many technology companies and has often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
this volatility may adversely effect the market price of the company s common stock
