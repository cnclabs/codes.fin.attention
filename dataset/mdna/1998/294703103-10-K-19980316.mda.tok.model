in accordance with the resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  ffo represent net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring or sales of property  plus depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
for the periods presented  depreciation  gain on the sale of hotel properties  minority interest and the extraordinary charge from write off of deferred financing fees were the only non cash adjustments 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments with respect to indebtedness on the hotels

the partnership receives cash payments from the lessees pursuant to the percentage leases 
the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  is dependent upon the lessees ability to make payments under the percentage leases 
all of crossroads lease obligations are guaranteed by interstate

at december   the company had outstanding debt of approximately million  including million under the bonds  and million under the unsecured line of credit  leaving approximately million available for future acquisitions 
the company s consolidated indebtedness was of its investments in hotels  at cost  at december  during  the company spent million  including million for renovations required by franchisors  to fund capital improvements to its properties  including replacement of carpets  drapes  renovation of common areas and improvements of hotel exteriors 
in addition  the company has committed to fund approximately million in for capital improvements  million of which is renovations required by franchisors 
the company intends to fund such improvements out of future cash from operations  present cash balances and borrowings under its unsecured line of credit 
under the unsecured line of credit and the bonds  the partnership is obligated to fund of room revenues per quarter on a cumulative basis  to a separate room renovation account for the ongoing replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels 
during and  non recurring enhancements for capital expenditures  based upon of room revenue  were million and million  respectively 
management believes that these amounts will be sufficient to fund required expenditures for the term of the percentage leases with the capital improvements anticipated and recurring repairs and maintenance performed by the lessees 
the company elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with its taxable year ended december   and expects to continue to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been reflected in the financial statements 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
the company intends to pay these distributions from operating cash flows

the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund both operating requirements and payment of distributions by the company in accordance with reit requirements 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of additional equity securities of the company or  in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties  the issuance of partnership units 
pursuant to the partnership agreement for the partnership  subject to certain holding period requirements  holders of units have the right to require the partnership to redeem their units 
during the year ended december   no units were tendered for redemption 
pursuant to the partnership agreement  the company has the option to redeem units tendered for redemption on a one for one basis for shares of common stock or for an equivalent amount of cash 
the company anticipates that it will acquire any units tendered for redemption in the foreseeable future in exchange for shares of common stock and has agreed to register such shares so as to be freely tradeable by the recipient 
inflation operators of hotels in general have the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit the lessees ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality hotel operations historically are seasonal in nature  generally reflecting higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenues to the extent that it receives percentage rent
