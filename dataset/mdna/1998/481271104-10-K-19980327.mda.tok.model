revenue growth has been primarily due to increases in average billing rates

the information management services business currently has two primary divisions the nt client server and network services division and the document management and imaging services division  the latter of which contains the consulting services division 
the business was originally formed in to provide networking services to educational markets  network design  installation and maintenance utilizing the company s private label pc products 
its nt client server and network services division was later expanded to include additional platforms and peripherals 
like other resellers  this division generates relatively low operating margins on hardware and software sales which have accounted for a substantial portion of networking revenues 
as such  this division historically has generated operating losses 
beginning in  the company anticipated the emergence of a market incorporating imaging and document management technology 
it entered this market first as a reseller of optika imaging systems  inc software  and later expanded its product line to include both high production  high end systems such as filenet and low end workflow imaging systems such as watermark  keyfile and lotus notes 
more recently  the company has devoted substantial resources to expand the infrastructure of its document management and imaging services division to support sales growth  including the hiring of numerous consulting  engineering  sales and administrative personnel since the beginning of revenue attributable to document management and imaging services division has grown from million in to million at december   representing approximately and of the information management services business total revenue in those periods  respectively 
however  the company s document management and imaging activities have generated operating losses to date due to slower than expected market expansion combined with the substantial investment in infrastructure development

seasonality and quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the company s last eight fiscal quarters 
in the opinion of the company s management  this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results set forth herein

 dollars in thousands net revenues         cost of sales exclusive of items shown separately below         selling and operating         general and administrative         total costs and expenses         income loss from operations    interest income expense and other  net income loss before income taxes    because the company only derives revenue in its contract placement business when its consultants are actually working  its revenues and operating results are adversely affected when its clients facilities close due to holidays or inclement weather 
the company also incurs additional expenses in its first fiscal quarter  in part as a result of higher employment and related payroll taxes 
during the quarters ended december  and  the number of holidays and vacation days marginally affected revenues in the contract placement business 
in addition  the company s contract placement business experienced higher than expected turnover of recruiting and sales personnel in the third and fourth quarters of the effect of this turnover  as well as lower than expected revenues in the information management services business  was the primary cause of the decrease in revenues on a quarter to quarter basis in the second half of liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s need for working capital has increased as its revenues have grown and it has used borrowings under its credit facility to fund working capital 
in february  however  the funds available for working capital purposes increased substantially as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from the offering 
the company continues to use the net proceeds from the offering as well as its cash flow from operations to fund its working capital and acquisition needs 
while the company has historically maintained minimal cash balances  the proceeds from the offering have increased it s cash and cash equivalents as of december  to million from approximately  at december  and  at december  in addition  the company has invested in short term  investment grade securities which amounted to  at december  subsequent to december  the company used a significant portion of its cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  approximately million  to purchase the assets of isi 
the company expects to use the remaining proceeds from the offering in the company used cash in operations of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this result is attributable to several factors  including an increase in net income of million in compared to and an increase in cash from operations offset by the purchase of short term investments in specifically  the company reduced the rate of growth in accounts receivable while increasing revenues  due primarily to increased controls on credit and collections since december  the increased controls have resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable days outstanding from approximately days at december  to approximately days at december  while the company will continue to strive to improve the credit and collection process  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain or improve its current credit and collection practices 
cash purchases of fixed assets for the fiscal years ended december    and were million   and  respectively 
these purchases were related primarily to the purchases of computers  software  and imaging equipment to upgrade the company s technology infrastructure  as well as the furnishing of new office facilities 
in the first quarter of the company received repayment of its loans to officers and related parties in the aggregate amount of  during the first quarter of  the company completed the offering 
from the proceeds of  net of underwriting discounts and commissions the company paid approximately  of accounting  legal  financial advisory  printing and other costs associated with the offering 
the company repaid in full its note payable due to the bank in the amount of million as well as an additional million in advances  and repaid other long term debt of million  which included payments related to the notes payable for the acquisitions of berkeley and systems automation 
subsequent to december  the company repaid the remaining  balance outstanding on the notes payable related to the berkeley acquisition  and repurchased as treasury stock  common shares  at a price of per share  which had been issued to the stockholders of berkeley in lieu of  of notes payable at the completion of the initial public offering 
the company has available an million revolving advance facility the line of credit with pnc bank  na successor to midlantic bank  na the line of credit expires on may  and carries interest at the bank s prime rate 
this facility allows the company to borrow the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable or million 
as of december  the company had no borrowings against the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains customary restrictive covenants  including limitations on loans the company may extend to officers and employees  the incurring of additional debt and the payment of dividends on the company s common shares 
the company is currently engaged in discussions with the bank to extend the line of credit to may   increase the maximum borrowings to million or of eligible accounts receivable  whichever is less  and offer the company the option of borrowing funds at either the bank s prime rate or basis points over the london inter bank offering rate 
however  there can be no assurance given that the company will be able to negotiate an extension of the line of credit on such terms pending completion and execution of loan documentation 
the company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will finance additional acquisitions  fund increases in accounts receivable and allow internal growth through new office locations 
the company believes that the proceeds from the offering and borrowings under the line of credit  or other credit facilities which may be available to the company in the future  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
inflation the company does not believe that the rates of inflation prevailing in the united states in recent years have had a significant effect on its operations 
year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties for whom the company implements year solutions on their computer systems 
the company believes its recently implemented financial information system is year compliant 
further  the company is currently in the process of replacing its two candidate and client databases utilized in its contract placement and permanent placement business with software systems that are represented by the vendors thereof to be year compliant 
the company is analyzing its remaining computer systems to identify any potential year issues and will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis 
management has not yet determined the cost related to achieving year compliance 
management believes  based on its available information that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effects on its business operations or financial condition 
forward looking information this report and other reports and statements filed by the company from time to time with the securities and exchange commission collectively  sec filings contain or may contain certain forward looking statements and information that are based on beliefs of  and information currently available to  the company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by the company s management 
when used in sec filings  and in oral statements by the company the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  future  intend  plan and similar expressions as they relate to the company or the company s management  identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to the company s operations and results of operations  competitive factors and pricing pressures  shifts in market demand  the performance and needs of the industries served by the company  and other risks and uncertainties  including  in addition to any uncertainties specifically identified in the text surrounding such statements and those identified below  uncertainties with respect to changes or developments in social  economic  business  industry  market  legal and regulatory circumstances and conditions and actions taken or omitted to be taken by third parties  including the company s shareholders  customers  suppliers  business partners  competitors  and legislative  regulatory  judicial and other governmental authorities and officials 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated  believed  estimated  expected  intended or planned 
dependence on availability of qualified technical consultants the company is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain technical consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of its clients 
to keep pace with rapidly evolving information technologies and changing client needs  the company must continually evaluate and upgrade its database of available qualified technical consultants 
competition for individuals with proven technical skills is intense  and  as is currently customary in the industry  the company does not have any exclusive contracts with its consultants 
the company competes for such individuals with other providers of technical staffing services  systems integrators  providers of outsourcing services  computer systems consultants  clients and temporary personnel agencies 
factors influencing such competition include compensation  benefits  growth opportunities and pre existing relationships with other companies  particularly specialty staffing companies 
as the company expands into new geographic areas  it may experience difficulty attracting qualified technical consultants who have a prior relationship or familiarity with more established specialty staffing companies in such areas 
there can be no assurance that qualified technical consultants will continue to be available to the company in sufficient numbers to meet the company s current and anticipated growth requirements 
acquisition risks a principal component of the company s growth strategy is the acquisition of companies that will complement and expand the company s existing businesses  principally in new geographic markets 
the successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on the company s ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire such companies on suitable terms and integrate their operations with those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that  if identified  the company will be able to acquire such companies on suitable terms 
the specialty staffing industry is relatively mature 
acquisitions in this industry are therefore likely to be at higher relative prices than for other industries due to competition from other staffing companies for acquisition candidates 
acquisitions also involve a number of special risks  including i adverse effects on the company s reported operating results  including increased goodwill amortization and interest expense  ii diversion of management attention  iii risks associated with unanticipated problems  liabilities or contingencies  iv difficulties related to the integration of the acquired business  and v dilution of existing shareholders 
the occurrence of some or all of the events described in these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to manage growth sustained or significant growth  if achieved  will subject the company to risks by placing a substantial strain on the company s available managerial  sales  recruiting  financial and other resources 
specifically  such growth will require the company to i hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing markets as well as markets in which the company has no prior operating experience  ii increase the sales and recruiting staffs in the first half of in its contract placement and permanent placement businesses by  iii develop and maintain relationships with an increasingly large number of highly qualified technical consultants  iv maintain cost controls in all of the company s businesses  and v apply its management practices to a significantly larger organization 
expansion beyond the geographic areas where the company s offices are presently located will further increase demands on the company s management 
the company s ability to manage its staff and facilities growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operational  financial and other internal systems 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be successfully implemented or adequate to support the company s expanded operations 
furthermore  an element of the company s business strategy is to cross sell the existing services of its four businesses to new and existing clients 
historically  these businesses have operated independently  producing only occasional referrals  and there can be no assurance that the company will successfully market such services on an integrated basis 
history of operating losses in information management services business the company s information management services business has had net operating losses since its commencement in  experienced a loss from operations of approximately million for the year ended december   and at december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
the losses have resulted from high marketing and general and administrative costs associated with building the business infrastructure and technical service capabilities  combined with historically low profit margins related to the hardware component of the nt client server and network services division and a slower emergence of the document management  document conversion and imaging market than anticipated by the company 
specifically  the costs associated with building this division s document management and imaging division s service capabilities have included the hiring of sales and technical personnel  the opening of a new office in new york city  and the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of two imaging and document management companies 
the company is currently focusing on achieving profitability in its information management services business by expanding it through internal growth  new service offerings and acquisitions  but cannot provide any assurances as to when it will achieve profitability  if at all 
typically  the decision by a prospective customer to install a network or to implement a document management system requires the company to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle and involves a significant commitment of resources by the customer over an extended period of time 
for these and other reasons  the sales and implementation cycles are subject to a number of significant delays over which the company has little or no control 
even if it increases sales  there can be no assurance that the information management services business will achieve a pricing and cost structure that will generate profits  or that the company will be able to identify and acquire appropriate acquisition candidates on favorable terms 
failure of the information management services business to grow through internal expansion and favorable acquisitions or to achieve profitability would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  including the potential impairment of recorded goodwill associated with the company s information management services business 
in addition  if the information management services business is unable to achieve profitability  it will not realize the federal tax benefit of its million operating loss carryforward which will expire between and dependence on contract placement business the company s contract placement business was responsible for  and of total company revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  for the years ended and  one customer of the contract placement business  merck company  inc  accounted for approximately and of total contract placement revenues  respectively  and and of total company revenues  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain this level of revenue from this client 
the ability of the company to sustain or increase revenues in the contract placement business is subject to various factors  including its ability to attract and retain qualified technical consultants  to hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing and new markets  to apply its management practices to a significantly larger organization and to consummate acquisitions of and to successfully integrate profitable staffing companies 
the inability of the company to successfully manage these factors would have a material adverse effect on the revenues of the contract placement business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase its contract placement revenues 
furthermore  a decline in the level of contract placement revenues would have a material adverse effect on the company
