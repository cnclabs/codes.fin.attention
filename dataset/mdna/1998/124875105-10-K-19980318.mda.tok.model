over the past three years  the corporation s results of operations have been significantly impacted by the following non recurring items which are described below 
to effect the salem trust and amfed mergers  the corporation incurred million of merger related expense in which included severance and other employee benefit costs  excess facilities costs  system conversion costs and other transaction related expenses 
the after tax effect of the merger related expense was million 
during  the corporation experienced two non recurring items 
first  the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic assessed a special one time levy the fdic special assessment to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund the saif which resulted in a special assessment totaling million for the subsidiary banks in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  ccb protested the amount of special assessment levied on certain portions of the saif deposit base and received a million reduction in the assessment 
ccb s saif deposits resulted from its prior acquisitions of thrift institutions 
second  through congressional legislative action  the recapture of tax bad debt reserves required upon a savings bank s conversion to a commercial bank was forgiven 
consequently  a million tax benefit was recorded prior to a former savings bank s merger into ccb the recapture tax benefit

net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total earning assets

as shown in table  the corporation realized net taxable equivalent interest income of million in average earning asset increases of million in were due to internal growth 
the percentage of loans and leases to total earning assets increased to during from in this shift from lower yielding investments and other short term funds to higher yielding loans and leases had a moderate effect on the yield on earning assets as it increased from s to s 
increases in the volume of earning assets  aided by increases in the rates earned on these assets  resulted in a million increase in total interest income 
offsetting the increased interest income were increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities and the rates paid on those liabilities which resulted in a net increase in net interest income of million and a net interest margin of for this compares to a net interest margin for both and the contribution of free liabilities to the net interest margin computed as net interest margin less the interest rate spread rose to basis points in from basis points in the interest rate spread grew basis points to for which compares to in and in see table for further analysis of the effects of volume and rate on net interest income

in  the corporation realized net taxable equivalent interest income of million 
average earning asset increases of million in were due to internal growth 
changes in the mix of earning assets toward higher earning loans and lease financing and increases in net interest income due to higher volumes were partially offset by lower rates earned on assets 
consequently  the interest rate spread fell to in from s 
however  the contribution of free liabilities to the net interest margin rose to basis points in from basis points in as a result  the net interest margin remained steady at  the same rate as the overall increase in net interest income of million was due to increases in volume of million offset by decreases in rate of million 
growth in the average earning asset base in the previous three years has primarily occurred in the loans and lease financing portfolio 
following a trend begun in  the mix in earning assets continued to shift toward loans and lease financing due to increased loan demand 
expansion of the earning asset base during the periods presented has been funded primarily with increases in the deposit base and the retention of earnings 
substantially all deposits originate within the market areas of ccb and amfed 
average total deposits increased by approximately million or in and million or in other income and other expenses other income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts  trust and custodian fees  sales and insurance commissions  fees and service charges for various other banking services provided to customers and accretion of negative goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions 
other income  excluding net securities gains or losses  totaled million for the year ended  an million increase over increases in other income were experienced in all categories of other income due to growth of the asset and customer bases  a stronger emphasis on the collection of fees for services rendered and new revenue generating customer service initiatives 
in addition  a heightened sales focus accompanied by expansion of incentive based compensation plans and the strength of the economic base in the markets served should result in higher revenues in other income  excluding net securities gains or losses  totaled million in and million in the five year compound growth rate for other income was at december  as in prior years  service charges on deposit accounts were the largest source of other income 
these service charges amounted to million in  a increase over the increase was due primarily to growth in the deposit base  repricing of certain customer services and additional surcharge income from foreign non subsidiary bank customers atm use on the subsidiary banks expanded atm network 
in addition  a greater emphasis was placed on developing potential commercial customers 
during  service charges on commercial accounts increased  over s level due to higher volume of accounts and expansion of services offered 
the corporation monitors service charges closely and evaluates such fees periodically to ensure that they reflect the costs of providing the services and to consider competitive factors 
trust and custodian fees rose to million in from million in due to growth in assets managed by the trust department and the continued promotion of employee benefit trust products introduced in trust and custodian fees totaled million in in july  amfed opened a trust department which currently has two offices located in south carolina 
management is positioning the trust departments to attract new consumer trust business as the number of people aged and over with incomes exceeding  is projected to grow significantly over the next five years as the baby boomer population reaches retirement age 
in addition  employee benefit related trust business will continue to be pursued as the subsidiary banks market the k spectrum r product 
managed assets totaled billion at december  and billion at december  sales and insurance commissions income totaled million in and million in the corporation offers complete brokerage services to customers through its subsidiaries  ccbiisc and asc  and an independent brokerage firm which generated million of income in and million in through a correspondent bank program initiated in  ccbiisc began providing brokerage services to another financial institution which will provide additional commission income 
ccbiisc will continue to pursue other correspondent bank relationships 
revenue in this category is also derived from the sale of insurance products and annuity products 
management anticipates a greater emphasis in on the sale of insurance products  particularly credit life insurance  by adopting some of amfed s successful insurance programs across the corporation s franchise 
negative goodwill the excess of net assets acquired over costs totaling million was recorded in connection with acquisitions completed in and is being accreted to income over a ten year period on a straight line basis 
accretion of negative goodwill totaled million in  and included in and s other operating income are mortgage servicing rights capitalization gains of million and million  respectively  from the sale of mortgage loans with servicing retained 
during  the corporation adopted accounting standards which require the recognition of mortgage servicing rights msr as an asset when mortgages are sold or securitized and servicing rights retained  regardless of how those servicing rights were acquired 
at december  and  there was no impairment of the recorded msr and no adjustment to the msr valuation account was made during or the corporation may periodically sell mortgages with servicing released through a contract with an out of state financial institution 
the corporation may elect to sell its originated servicing since it does not have the economies of scale needed to make mortgage servicing a profitable line of business over the long term

the taxable equivalent basis is computed using a federal tax rate and applicable state tax rates 
noninterest expenses  excluding non recurring items  rose million or in over s level of million 
this increase was due primarily to a million increase in personnel expense 
despite the increases  noninterest expenses are growing at a slower rate than average assets 
as reported in table  total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets continued to show improvement  falling to for from a high of in the increase in personnel expense was due in part to general wage and employee benefit increases and a greater emphasis on incentive based compensation 
within personnel expense  salaries and wages increased million  employee benefits increased million and the remaining increases were in employee training and other costs 
net occupancy and equipment expense remained stable for the three year period ended december  the costs of disposing of excess facilities and operational systems are included in merger related expense and are excluded from the analysis in table other operating expenses  excluding non recurring items  increased by million in or from overall  other operating expenses have increased due to the expanded branch network 
increases were experienced in data processing  printing and office supplies  postage and telecommunications 
additional marketing expense of  was incurred due in part to the marketing of the alternative service delivery channels introduced over the last three years 
these service delivery initiatives include on line banking  extended hour in store branches and telebanking

as shown in table  noninterest expense  excluding non recurring items  decreased as a percentage of average assets from in to in excluding the impact of the special assessment  s other operating expenses of million increased over s million 
the million decrease in deposit and other insurance expense resulting from reduced fdic deposit insurance premiums was offset by a million increase in professional services fees for the engagement of consultants to recommend opportunities to earn additional noninterest revenues or to decrease noninterest expenses through improvement of operating processes and procedures 
the improvement in the operating efficiency ratios disclosed in table are due in part to implementation of those recommendations 
the corporation s efficiency ratio noninterest expense as a percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income and other income has improved over the past four years from in to in as disclosed in table management s goal is to reach and maintain an efficiency ratio of less than 
management will continue to closely monitor this ratio and anticipates continuing improvement as revenue enhancement opportunities are identified and cost containment programs are continued

this loan growth percentage was achieved despite the securitization and sale of million of mortgage loans and the sale of finance south s million of consumer loans 
the five year compound growth rate for average loans and lease financing was and for average assets was 
loans and lease financing the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are comprised primarily of diversified credits with little borrower or industry concentration 
management believes that lending to smaller sized commercial customers and consumers allows a higher interest rate spread which helps support the net interest margin 
table shows the year end breakdown of the major categories of the loans and lease financing portfolio for the previous five years based upon regulatory classifications 
outstanding loans and lease financing increased million over s outstandings 
all of the loan growth was internally generated 
substantially all loans are made on a secured basis with the exception of revolving credit accounts and  with the exception of marketable mortgage loans  are originated for retention in the subsidiary banks portfolios 
in general  the subsidiary banks do not purchase loans or participate with others in the origination of loans and confine their lending activities to north and south carolina except for credit card receivables which are offered on a nationwide basis and automobile loans which are offered from virginia to georgia through referrals from a major automobile insurance company 
lending officers of the subsidiary banks generally consider the cash flow or earnings power of the borrower as the primary source of repayment 
the subsidiary banks do not engage in highly leveraged transactions or foreign lending activities 
there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans other than those categories in table t a b l e loans and lease financing in thousands as of december commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      instalment loans to individuals      revolving credit      lease financing      total gross loans and lease financing      less unearned income      total loans and lease financing      during  certain loans were reviewed and found to have been improperly classified as to loan type 
consequently  loans totaling million were reclassified from commercial  financial and agricultural to real estate mortgage million and real estate construction million 
loans in the commercial  financial and agricultural category consist primarily of short term and or floating rate commercial loans made to medium sized companies 
there is no substantial loan concentration in any one industry or to any one borrower 
real estate construction loans are primarily made to commercial developers and residential contractors on a floating rate basis 
cash flow analyses for each project are the primary decision factor  with additional reliance upon collateral values 
management expects moderate to strong growth to continue in these categories during the subsidiary banks will maintain their focus on quality credit underwriting 
see table for a schedule of maturities and sensitivities of certain loan types to changes in interest rates 
real estate mortgage loans consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences of total real estate mortgage loans 
the remainder of real estate mortgage loans are primarily for commercial purposes and often include the commercial borrower s real property in addition to other collateral 
it is the subsidiary banks general policy to retain adjustable rate  first deed of trust mortgage loans within the portfolio and sell all fixed rate production 
while the lower interest rate environment anticipated for is favorable to home buyers and borrowers seeking to re finance their mortgages  with the subsidiary banks plans to sell all marketable fixed rate mortgages  the mortgage portfolios may not grow in proportion to s expected production volume 
consequently  management anticipates only moderate growth in this category for instalment loans to individuals consist primarily of loans secured by automobiles and other consumer personal property 
lending officers consider the customer s debt obligations  ability and willingness to repay and general economic trends in their decision to extend credit 
since  the corporation has had an alliance with a major automobile insurance company  which  through referrals from company agents  has increased the amount of automobile loans outstanding 
the agreements with the insurance company cover a market area stretching from virginia to georgia 
revolving credit includes overdraft protection and traditional credit card products 
the credit card program was restructured in late customers have more options based on credit card interest rates and annual fees 
additionally  a credit card product offering travel awards for airline flights based on card usage was introduced 
this product  which is administered by a third party  is expected to generate significant consumer interest as the travel awards are not limited to a particular travel partner but can be used with any of the major airlines 
amfed did not offer credit cards at the time of the merger and thus their customer base provides an additional opportunity to grow the credit card portfolio 
with continued emphasis on prudent underwriting standards  management expects moderate growth during the leasing portfolio  net of unearned income  increased in to million 
the leasing portfolio is not concentrated in any one line of business or type of equipment 
management intends to expand the leasing portfolio through an emphasis on commercial equipment leases  which it feels is a more profitable market than consumer leases 
t a b l e maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates in thousands as of december  commercial  financial and real estate agricultural construction total due in one year or less    due after one year through five years fixed interest rates    floating interest rates    due after five years fixed interest rates    floating interest rates    total    investment securities investment securities increased from year end to billion at december  due to the interest rate environment  the corporation is experiencing higher levels of paydowns for mortgage backed securities included within us government agencies and corporations 
these funds are being reinvested in shorter term us treasury securities and us government agencies as there is not an interest rate advantage in committing funds to longer term investments 
despite investment securities period to period increase  investment securities as a percentage of total earning assets declined due to the previously discussed shift in earning assets to higher yielding loans 
average investment securities totaled of total average earning assets for versus for taxable securities remain the primary component of the portfolio 
the corporation segregates debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values into one of three categories for accounting and reporting purposes 
debt and equity securities that the corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
securities held to maturity totaled million or of the total investment securities portfolio at december  debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
the corporation had no trading securities at december   or nor at any time during those years 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or as trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders equity  net of taxes 
at december   securities available for sale totaled billion  which represented over of the total portfolio 
the mark to market adjustment for available for sale securities totaled million in unrealized gains at december  and  after considering applicable taxes  resulted in a million addition to total shareholders equity 
as of december   the mark to market adjustment for available for sale securities totaled million and resulted in a million addition to total shareholders equity after applying applicable taxes 
the corporation does not currently anticipate selling a significant amount of the securities available for sale in the near future 
future fluctuations in shareholders equity may occur due to changes in the market values of debt and equity securities classified as available for sale

these banking offices have extended hours during the weekday and are open on weekends and holidays 
an additional seven new ccb offices are planned for in store banking offices are a new source of consumer loans and deposits and noninterest fee income 
long term debt and other borrowings the corporation s ratio of long term debt to shareholders equity increased to at december  from at december  the increase was due to obtaining additional advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb at favorable interest rates 
the advances were used to fund loan growth 
during  the corporation repurchased and retired million of the million of subordinated notes issued during the early retirement resulted in a net gain of  also during  amfed prepaid two fhlb advances with interest rates from to which resulted in prepayment penalties of million  after tax

the remainder  tier ii capital  may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock  and a limited amount of the general reserve for loan and lease losses 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve board has adopted a minimum leverage capital ratio under which a bank holding company must maintain a minimum level of tier i capital to average total consolidated assets of at least in the case of a bank holding company which has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion 
all other bank holding companies are expected to maintain a leverage capital ratio of at least to above the stated minimum

the corporation s dividend guideline is to pay approximately to of operating earnings in dividends 
management feels that this guideline provides a reasonable cash return to shareholders and at the same time maintains sufficient equity to support future growth and expansion 
capital expenditures for new and improved facilities as well as furniture and equipment amounted to million in  million in and million in there were no significant capital resource commitments at december  other than the operating lease commitments specified in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and resolution of year technology concerns as discussed below 
internally  the corporation has budgeted million in for technological improvements and new or renovated facilities 
technology improvements planned for include tools to enhance cross selling  track profitability of individual customers and measure product profitability 
year issue the corporation is in the midst of its project to assess and correct the impact of the year issue 
the year issue resulted from many computer programs having been written using two digit dates rather than four to define the applicable year 
historically  the first two digits were eliminated to save memory 
since there is no accommodation for the full four digit year  a serious problem occurs when is used to identify the year it is not only impossible to distinguish from but it also becomes difficult to calculate the passage of time between preceding years and the year this error could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process customer transactions  properly accrue interest income and expense or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  non banking systems such as security alarms  elevators  telephones  etc 
are subject to malfunction due to their dependence upon computers for proper operation 
as described  the year issue presents a number of challenges to financial institution management  correction of year issues will be costly and complex for the entire industry 
based on a recently completed assessment  the corporation has determined that it will be required to modify a significant portion of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  due to the corporation s use of one integrated financial management system for many of its primary applications loans  deposits  general ledger  etc 
and restrictions on custom coding  the corporation has no reason to believe that these applications will not become year compliant through upgrades of the existing software 
these upgrades were provided to the corporation in early after the software vendor completed its testing of year compliance 
outside consultants assisting in the assessment phase of year issues determined that the corporation s policy of controlling custom code saved approximately million to million in year expense 
the assessment phase also identified certain software systems and hardware that will have to be replaced 
the corporation presently believes that with the identified modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the corporation 
the corporation will utilize both internal and external resources to modify or replace and test software for year modifications 
the corporation anticipates that its critical applications will be modified or replaced by the end of which will allow testing and any subsequent modifications to be completed in as the corporation and its subsidiary banks are regulated by federal and state banking regulatory agencies  they will be required to comply with those agencies year modification schedules 
the federal banking agencies plan to conduct a supervisory review of all financial institutions year conversion efforts by mid federal regulators are currently conducting such a review of ccb  management does not anticipate criticism of its year progress to date or its anticipated schedule to complete the year project as it has adopted the regulators project management process 
management believes that it will meet the regulators timeframe for year compliance 
during and  the corporation incurred less than  of expenses attributable to the year project 
the total remaining cost of the year project is estimated at million  of which million is attributable to the purchase of new software and hardware which will be capitalized 
the remaining million  which will be expensed as incurred over the next three years  is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
the corporation is communicating with its significant vendors to determine the extent to which the corporation is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
in addition  the corporation will initiate communication with its significant corporate customers to determine the extent of their year preparedness 
as most corporate customers depend on computer systems that must be year compliant  a disruption in their business may result in potentially significant financial difficulties that could affect their creditworthiness 
finally  financial institutions such as the subsidiary banks exchange large volumes of date sensitive data electronically between other financial institutions  customers and their regulatory agencies 
there can be no guarantee that those external systems will properly exchange date time data with the corporation s systems 
the corporation will test and verify  as appropriate  data exchanges with clearing associations  governmental entities  customers and other financial institutions 
the estimated costs to assess the impact on third parties are included in the corporation s total year project costs and estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the corporation s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the corporation s systems  would not have an adverse effect on the corporation 
the costs of the year project and the date on which the corporation plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved at the cost disclosed or within the timeframe anticipated

unallocated portion of reserve    total    the allocation of the reserve for loan and lease losses by loan type is based on management s on going evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses 
since the factors involved in such evaluation are subject to change  the allocation of the reserve to the respective loan types is not necessarily indicative of future losses in each loan type 
additionally  no assurances can be made that the allocation shown will be indicative of future allocations 
loans are considered impaired if it is probable that the subsidiary banks will be unable to collect all amounts due under the terms of the loan agreement 
the value of the impaired loan is based on the present value of the impaired loan s expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  the observable market price of the impaired loan  or the fair value of the collateral for a collateral dependent loan 
any measurement losses are recognized through additions to the allowance for loan losses 
at december  and  impaired loans amounted to million and million  respectively 
the related reserve for loan and lease losses on these loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan and lease financing portfolio 
a key tool in controlling loan losses is the corporation s loan grading system that begins at the inception of the credit relationship 
under this grading system  substantially all credit relationships greater than  excluding residential mortgage and home equity lines are assigned grades that direct the timing and intensity of loan review activity throughout the life of the relationship 
all significant relationships are reviewed at least annually 
relationships that have the lowest grade are reviewed each thirty days 
management periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve through a model which incorporates the results of credit reviews  historical loss experience and other factors 
based on this review  the loan and lease loss reserve is adequate to cover known and inherent losses in the loan and lease financing portfolio 
the most recent regulatory agency examinations have not revealed any material problem credits that had not been previously identified  however  future regulatory examinations may result in the regulatory agencies requiring additions to the reserve for loan and lease losses based on information available at the examination date 
liquidity and interest sensitivity liquidity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan and capital expenditure commitments  maintain reserve requirements  pay operating expenses  provide funds for dividends  debt service and other commitments and operate the organization on an ongoing basis 
funds are primarily provided by the subsidiary banks through financial resources from operating activities  expansion of the deposit base  borrowing funds in money market operations and through the sale or maturity of assets 
net cash provided by operating activities and deposits from customers have historically been primary sources of liquidity for the corporation 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average total deposits have grown by million  million and million during the three previous years 
average certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more still comprise a relatively small percentage of average total deposits  in versus in these deposits increased on the average million from to management intentionally keeps the corporation s reliance on the higher cost large certificates of deposit low because of the availability of less expensive sources of funding and considers them a secondary source of liquidity that can be obtained as needed 
at december   time certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more were million compared to million at december  during  the maximum month end balance for time certificates of deposit in amounts of  totaled million 
the following is a remaining maturity schedule of these deposits at december  in thousands over over months through through or less months months total jumbo deposits     as previously discussed  due to increased loan demand  the subsidiary banks have become net short term borrowers 
the corporation s average short term borrowings  net of average short term investments  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
correspondent relationships are maintained with several larger banks to be able to purchase federal funds when needed 
also available as liquidity sources are access to the federal reserve discount window and ccb s million line of credit maintained with the fhlb 
this line of credit is secured by a blanket collateral agreement on ccb s mortgage loan portfolio 
maturities of securities held for investment and sales and maturities of securities categorized as available for sale are other sources of liquidity 
securities with carrying values of million mature in the available for sale portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  obligations of us government agencies and corporations and equity securities 
securities available for sale will be considered in the corporation s asset liability management strategies and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs and or significant prepayment risk 
liquidity at the parent company level is provided through cash dividends from the subsidiary banks  the repayment of demand notes payable to the parent company from the subsidiary banks and the capacity of the parent company to raise additional funds as needed 
in addition to ensuring adequate liquidity  the corporation is concerned with the management of its balance sheet to maintain relatively stable net interest margins despite changes in the interest rate environment 
responsibility for both liquidity and interest sensitivity management rests with the corporation s asset liability management committee alco comprised of senior management 
alco reviews the corporation s interest rate and liquidity exposures and  based on its view of existing and expected market conditions  adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income to the extent possible while minimizing the risk associated with unanticipated changes in interest rates 
determining and monitoring the appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities and the impact on earnings of changes in interest rates is accomplished through alco s use of gap analysis and simulation analysis 
gap analysis measures the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities at a given point in time 
the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities is based on the timing of contractual maturities and repricing opportunities 
prepayments of loans and certain investment securities and early withdrawals of deposits represent options which may or may not be exercised 
a positive interest sensitive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities 
the reverse situation results in a negative gap 
management feels that an essentially balanced position of total earning assets between interest sensitive assets and liabilities is necessary in order to protect against wide fluctuations in interest rates 
an analysis of the corporation s interest sensitivity position at december  is presented in table at december   the corporation had a cumulative negative gap interest sensitive liabilities exceeding interest sensitive assets of million or of total earning assets over a twelve month horizon 
the ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities was 
x 
gap analysis is a limited measurement tool  however  because it does not incorporate the interrelationships between interest rates charged or paid  balance sheet trends and management s reaction in response to interest rate changes 
in addition  a gap analysis model does not consider that changes in interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
therefore  alco uses gap analysis as a tool to monitor changes in the balance sheet structure 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on the corporation s earnings  alco uses simulation analysis

the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it is prepared 
investment securities are presented at their amortized cost 
the mark to market adjustment of  for available for sale securities is not included 
simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model which incorporates current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates  and future volumes 
using this information  the model calculates earnings estimates for the corporation under multiple interest rate scenarios 
to measure the sensitivity of the corporation s earnings  the results of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
as a matter of policy  alco has stated that the maximum negative impact to net income from a positive or negative basis point change in interest rates over a month period should not exceed  which was achieved during at december   interest sensitivity was well under this guideline 
alco actually manages earnings sensitivity  however  with a targeted goal of only a to impact on net income 
if simulation results show that earnings sensitivity exceeds the targeted limits  alco will adopt on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
management uses both on and off balance sheet strategies to manage the balance sheet 
the most efficient and cost effective method of on balance sheet management is creating desired maturity and repricing streams through the tactical pricing of interest earning and interest bearing on balance sheet products 
alco reviews the interest earning and interest bearing portfolios to ensure that the corporation has a proper mix of fixed and variable rate products 
emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where possible 
this strategy increases liquidity and is necessitated by the continued shortening of maturities and more frequent repricing opportunities of the corporation s funding sources 
as of year end  approximately of all loans reprice or mature within days 
see table for additional detail regarding loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates at december  within the corporation s overall interest rate risk management strategy  off balance sheet derivatives have been and may be used in the future as a cost and capital efficient way to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity of on balance sheet assets or liabilities 
as of december   the corporation had an off balance sheet derivative financial instrument in the form of an interest rate swap a basis swap with a notional principal of million 
the interest rate swap was entered into in november and has a two year term 
the purpose of entering into the interest rate swap was to synthetically convert us treasury based liabilities into prime rate based liabilities and to lock in a wide spread between the two indices 
this financial instrument had a nominal positive effect on interest expense for the corporation was not party to any other off balance sheet derivative financial instruments during although off balance sheet derivative financial instruments would not expose the corporation to credit risk equal to the notional amount of the contracts  the corporation would be exposed to credit risk to the extent of the fair value of the unrealized gain if any in the off balance sheet derivative instrument if the counterparty failed to perform 
credit risk resulting from a counterparty s nonperformance of any contracts would be monitored through routine review of the counterparty s financial ratings 
the corporation has not experienced any liquidity problems in the past nor are problems anticipated in the future 
reliance will continue to be placed on the same funding sources  primarily financial resources provided by operating activities and expansion of the core deposit base 
management will continue to monitor the corporation s interest sensitivity position with goals of ensuring adequate liquidity while at the same time seeking profitable spreads between the yields on funding uses and the rates paid for funding sources 
other accounting matters the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures of information about capital structure 
sfas no 
continues the existing requirements to disclose the pertinent rights and privileges of all securities other than ordinary common stock but expands the number of companies subject to portions of its requirements 
specifically  sfas no 
requires all entities to provide the capital structure disclosures previously required by apb opinion no 
companies that were exempt from the provisions of opinion no 
will now need to make those disclosures 
sfas no 
will have no impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
the objective of the statement is to report a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events during the period other than transaction with owners therein defined as comprehensive income 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other nonshareholder changes in equity 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application permitted 
if comparative financial statements are provided for earlier periods  those financial statements shall be reclassified to reflect application of the provisions of sfas no 
adoption of this statement will not change total shareholders equity as previously reported 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
requires disclosures for each segment that are similar to those required under current standards with the addition of quarterly disclosure requirements and a finer partitioning of geographic disclosures 
it requires limited segment data on a quarterly basis 
it also requires geographic data by country  as opposed to broader geographic regions as permitted under current standards 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application permitted 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements as the corporation has one operating segment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
the corporation s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of the corporation s loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
the corporation does not maintain a trading account nor is the corporation subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk rests with the asset liability management committee alco which is comprised of senior management 
alco regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate risk position and adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income while maintaining market risk within a set of board approved guidelines 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on the corporation s earnings  alco uses simulation analysis 
simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model which incorporates current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates and future volumes 
to measure the sensitivity of the corporation s earnings  the result of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
the model assumes an immediate parallel shift in interest rates 
as a matter of policy  alco has stated that the maximum negative impact to net income from a positive or negative basis point change in interest rates over a month period should not exceed 
however  alco actually manages earnings sensitivity within a targeted range of only a to impact on net income 
the corporation s interest rate risk position based on simulation results as of december  is as follows basis point change in interest rates projected percentage change in net income 
as of december   management believes that it has accomplished its objective to avoid material negative changes in net income resulting from changes in interest rates 
projected percentage changes in net income brought about by changes in interest rates are not material relative to the corporation s net income 
if simulation results indicate earnings sensitivity in excess of the targeted limits  alco will adopt on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
on balance sheet strategies involve the creation of desired maturity and repricing streams through the tactical pricing of interest earning and interest bearing portfolios to ensure that the corporation has a proper mix of fixed and variable rate products 
as of december   the corporation had an off balance sheet derivative financial instrument outstanding in the form of an interest rate swap a basis swap with a notional amount of million 
the two year term basis swap was entered into in november to synthetically convert us treasury based liabilities into prime rate based liabilities and to lock in the favorable spread between the two indices 
the corporation was not a party to any other off balance sheet derivative financial instruments during emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where possible 
this strategy increases liquidity and is necessitated by the continued shortening of maturities and more frequent repricing opportunities of the corporation s funding sources 
management will continue to monitor the corporation s interest rate risk position to minimize the adverse impact of earnings caused by changes in interest rates
