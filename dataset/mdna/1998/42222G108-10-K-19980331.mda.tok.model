revenues for as compared to increased due to the acquisition of mhn in march as well as growth in aso  bill review and other services 
the company expects continued pressure from employer groups to maintain modest increases in premiums for behavioral health  dental and vision products 
specialty services costs have decreased as a percentage of specialty services revenue to for as compared to in the decrease is due to the adverse reserve development recognized in the fourth quarter of which resulted in a higher mcr during as well as the favorable benefit of the mhn acquisition 
specialty services costs as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in due to the aforementioned adverse reserve development recognized in discontinued operations workers compensation insurance business the company revised its strategy of maintaining a presence in the workers compensation insurance business as a result of various adverse developments arising in in the workers compensation insurance business  primarily related to the workers compensation claims environment in california 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  such adverse developments caused the company to strengthen its workers compensation reserves at the end of these developments also led the company to adopt a plan to completely discontinue this segment of its business  through divestiture of its workers compensation risk assuming insurance subsidiaries 
the company is presently conducting the sale of these businesses 
the company s workers compensation insurance companies consist of the following california compensation insurance company  a specialty workers compensation carrier writing business primarily in california  business insurance company  a national workers compensation specialty carrier  commercial compensation insurance company  and combined benefits insurance company  writing single source workers compensation and employee group health insurance primarily in california 
the workers compensation companies entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement quota share treaty with general reinsurance corporation gen re effective july  and also entered into an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement aggregate treaty with gen re effective january  under the quota share treaty  the company ceded of its net premiums earned  losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred to gen re from july  to december  and ceded of its net retained business from january  to june  the quota share treaty contains a provisional ceding commission  which adjusts based on actual reported loss experience on the subject business 
the company stopped ceding under the quota share treaty effective july  the aggregate treaty was entered into at a premium cost of million  in exchange for million of reinsurance coverage for the first six months of effective july  a second six month aggregate treaty was entered into with gen re at a cost of million  in exchange for million of reinsurance coverage 
for the twelve months ended december   a total of million of premiums were ceded to gen re for aggregate excess of loss reinsurance protection  and the company ceded million of ceded losses incurred for the year 
workers compensation revenue of million increased in as compared to the increase in revenue is due to an increase in gross premium revenues  investment income and capital gains  offset by the cost of the aggregate excess treaty 
net premiums earned increased by in as compared to due primarily to national expansion of workers compensation in states outside california  offset by reduced premium writings in california 
premiums earned on policies issued in california continue to be negatively affected by price competition since the start of competitive rating on january  revenue of million in increased by million or as compared to the increase in revenue was due primarily to an increase in premium revenues 
net investment income for increased million or 
the increased investment income is due to an increase in assets available for investment  from higher operational cash flow and capital surplus contributions of million in mid to the insurance operations to support premium writings 
net investment income of million in increased million or compared to the increase in investment income is due to an increase in assets available for investment from operational cash flow and capital contributions 
realized capital gains of million in were an increase of million from this increase was due to reductions in long term interest rates in the bond market  primarily for tax exempt bonds  provided an opportunity to sell securities and realize gains in the fourth quarter of the primary ratios used to measure underwriting performance of the workers compensation companies are the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  the underwriting expense ratio  and the policyholder dividend ratio  which when added together constitute the combined ratio 
these ratios are calculated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the following sets forth the workers compensation companies underwriting experience as measured by its combined ratio and its components for the twelve months ended december   and loss and loss adjustment expense underwriting expense policyholder dividends 
combined ratio the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to in as compared to in the increase in is primarily due to an increase in the estimates for accident year and prior loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred  which estimates were increased by million in the cause of the increase in the accident year and prior estimates was due to changes to the california permanent disability rating schedules in april which adversely affected average claim severity in california 
the change to the permanent disability rating schedules had a negative affect on the entire california workers compensation industry 
in addition  a court ruling in late expanded the presumption of the treating physician related to workers compensation workplace injuries in determining the disability of the injured worker 
the impact of this court ruling also increased claim severity 
the increase to accident year and prior loss estimates represented of net premiums earned for the effect of the accounting of the aggregate treaty reduced the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio by  due to more ceded losses incurred than ceded premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio increased by in as compared to the increase in the ratio is primarily due to the accounting for the aggregate treaty  which does not have an underwriting expense provision as part of the agreement 
also  under the quota share treaty  the ceding of the company s net retained business was substantially less in than in as such  ceded commission in under the quota share treaty has a positive effect on the underwriting expense ratio  and a lower beneficial impact on the ratio in the pro forma impact to the underwriting expense ratio without accounting for the aggregate and quota share treaties would have been in compared to in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased basis points in as compared to in  this ratio was favorably impacted by a million reduction to accident year and prior loss and loss adjustment expense estimates 
in  the comparable amount of development for accident years and prior was an increase to the losses and loss adjustment expense incurred of million 
the loss from discontinued operations for the segment was million in as compared to income of in the loss in was primarily due to the strengthening of reserves in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company recorded an estimate of the loss to be incurred when the workers compensation insurance operations are sold of approximately million  net of tax 
physician practice management business on june  the company executed a stock and note purchase agreement with fpa for the purchase by fpa of the company s medical practices 
the transaction was consummated in november and the company recognized a net of tax gain on sale of million  net of million of taxes  in in  the company recognized an additional million gain on the sale  net of million of taxes  as a result of the final settlement of certain contractual provisions 
the income and loss on discontinued operations  net of taxes  for the medical practices was million during and million during the results in both years were primarily due to insufficient patient volume being served by the medical practices 
in  the loss was reduced by a gain of million related to the sale of various independent practice associations

certain subsidiaries must maintain ratios of current assets to current liabilities of pursuant to certain government contracts 
the company believes it is in compliance with these contractual and regulatory requirements in all material respects 
the company believes that cash from operations  existing working capital  lines of credit  and funds from planned divestitures of business are adequate to fund existing obligations  introduce new products and services  and continue to develop health care related businesses 
the company regularly evaluates cash requirements for current operations and commitments  and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
the company may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through additional debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise  as appropriate 
government health care receivables are best estimates of payments that are ultimately collectible 
since these amounts are subject to government audit and negotiation  amounts ultimately collected may vary from current estimates 
for the year ended december   cash used from operating activities was million compared to million in the prior year 
this was due primarily to payments for merger  restructuring and other costs associated with the fhs combination  as well as gem costs 
this was partially offset by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities primarily caused by timing differences in the payment of accounts payables and other liabilities  reserves for claims and other settlements  and deferred taxes at each respective year end 
net cash used by investing activities was million during as compared to million during this decrease during was due to higher net redemptions of investments available for sale  an early payment related to the fpa note receivable  offset by the cost of the acquisitions of fohp  physician health services  inc phs  pacc  advantage health and christiania general insurance corporation 
net cash generated from financing activities was million in as compared to million during the same period in the increase in was due primarily to additional draws under the revolving line of credit of million that was used primarily to finance the new acquisitions  offset by the repurchase of stock from the california wellness foundation of million and the repayment of senior notes of million 
the company has a billion credit facility the credit facility  with bank of america as administrative agent for the lenders thereto  which was amended pursuant to a letter agreement dated march  with the lenders the credit facility letter agreement 
all previous revolving credit facilities were terminated and rolled into the credit facility on july  at the election of the company  and subject to customary covenants  loans are initiated on a bid or committed basis and carry interest at offshore or domestic rates  at the applicable libor rate plus margin or the bank reference rate 
actual rates on borrowings under the credit facility vary  based on competitive bids and the company s unsecured credit rating at the time of the borrowing 
under the credit facility letter agreement  the margins used in setting the facility fee and borrowing rates under the credit facility were increased 
accordingly  the company will incur an increase in the all in margin of based on its debt rating as of december  under the terms of the credit facility 
any decrease in such rating would result in an increase in such margin 
the credit facility is available for five years  until july  but it may be extended under certain circumstances for two additional years 
see  other information revolving credit facility contained in this report for further information concerning the revolving credit facility on june  the company consummated a cash tender offer to repurchase all of its million outstanding principal amount of senior notes due the purchase price per  principal amount of notes was 
during the quarter ended june   the company sold  shares of common stock of fpa that it had received as consideration in its sale of the medical practices 
the proceeds from the sale of stock were approximately million  or an average of per share 
in addition  as of june  fpa prepaid approximately million due on a promissory note received as consideration in the company s sale of its medical practices 
on june   the company redeemed  shares of class b common stock from the california wellness foundation the cwf at a price of per share 
the company provided its consent to permit the cwf to sell  shares of class b common stock to an unrelated third party in june of and to sell  shares of class b common stock to unrelated third parties throughout august of on november   the company also provided its consent to permit the cwf to sell  shares of class b common stock to an unrelated third party 
pursuant to the company s certificate of incorporation  such  shares   shares and  shares of class b common stock automatically converted into shares of class a common stock in the hands of such third parties 
the company s subsidiaries must comply with certain minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations 
the long term portion of principal and interest payments under the cwf notes issued to the company in connection with the health net conversion is subordinated to health net meeting tangible equity requirements under applicable california statutes and regulations 
as of december   the company s subsidiaries were in compliance with minimum capital requirements 
impact of inflation and other elements the managed health care industry is labor intensive and its profit margin is low  hence  it is especially sensitive to inflation 
increases in medical expenses or contracted medical rates without corresponding increases in premiums could have a material adverse effect on the company 
various federal and state legislative initiatives regarding the health care industry have been proposed during recent legislative sessions  and health care reform and similar issues continue to be in the forefront of social and political discussion 
if health care reform or similar legislation is enacted  such legislation could impact the company 
management cannot at this time predict whether any such initiative will be enacted and  if enacted  the impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company s ability to expand its business is dependent  in part  on competitive premium pricing and its ability to secure cost effective contracts with providers 
achieving these objectives is becoming increasingly difficult due to the competitive environment 
in addition  the company s profitability is dependent  in part  on its ability to maintain effective control over health care costs while providing members with quality care 
factors such as health care reform  integration of acquired companies  regulatory changes  utilization  new technologies  hospital costs  major epidemics and numerous other external influences may affect the company s operating results 
accordingly  past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical records to anticipate results or future period trends 
the company s hmo and insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves to cover their estimated ultimate liability for expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
these reserves are estimates of future payments based on various assumptions 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience  which in the past has resulted and in the future could result in loss reserves being too high or too low 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicial administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
future loss development or governmental regulators could require reserves for prior periods to be increased  which would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
in light of present facts and current legal interpretations  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for claims and loss reserves 
reference is also made to the disclosures contained under the heading cautionary statements included elsewhere in this annual report or form k  which could cause the company s actual results to differ from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made on behalf of the company 
in addition  certain of these factors may have affected the company s past results and may affect future results 
year the company recognizes that the arrival of the year requires computer systems to be able to recognize the date change from to and  like other companies  is assessing and modifying its computer applications and business processes to provide for their continued functionality 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare invoices or engage in normal business activities 
the year effort for the company has the highest priority of technology projects 
the project has dedicated resources with multiple teams to address unique systems environment 
uniform project management techniques are in place with overall oversight responsibility residing with the company s chief technology officer 
emphasis has been placed on business unit involvement and the use of internal staff enhanced by external specialists 
selected systems will be retired with the business functions being converted to year compliant systems 
a number of the company s systems include packaged software from large vendors that the company is closely monitoring to ensure that these systems are year compliant 
the company believes that vendors will make timely updates available to ensure that all remaining purchased software is year compliant 
the remaining systems compliance with year will be addressed by internal technical staff 
the company has initiated formal communications with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year issues 
there can be no assurances that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that the failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not anticipate that the related overall costs to resolve these potential year problems will be material to any single year 
the total current cost estimate for the year project is between and million  of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
however  notwithstanding the foregoing  the costs of the project and the timetable in which the company plans to complete the year compliance requirements are based on estimates derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can therefore be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
at this time it is unclear as to the extent of existing insurance coverage  if any  the company may have to cover potential year liabilities 
the company is currently analyzing the obtainment of such coverage 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continuing operations the company is exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to its investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining fixed income investments 
the company is exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  the company is exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception may affect the value of financial instruments 
the company has several bond portfolios to fund reserves 
the company attempts to manage the interest rate risks related to its investment portfolios by actively managing the asset liability duration of its investment portfolios 
the overall goal of the investment portfolios is to support the ongoing operations of the company s business units 
the company s philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit will have additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
the company manages these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
the company uses a value at risk model to assess the market risk of its investments 
the estimation of potential losses that could arise from changes in market conditions is typically accomplished through the use of statistical models which seek to predict risk of loss based on historical price and volatility patterns 
the company s measured value at risk for its investments from continuing operations  using a confidence level  was approximately million at december  the company s calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on its investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s investment portfolios during the year 
the company  however  believes that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of interest rate movements on the respective liabilities  since these liabilities are affected by many of the same factors that affect asset performance  that is  economic activity  inflation and interest rates  as well as regional and industry factors 
in addition  the company has some interest rate market risk due to its borrowings 
notes payable  capital leases and other financing arrangements total  million and the related average interest rate is which interest rate is subject to change pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement 
see a description of the credit facility under liquidity and capital resources 
the table below presents the expected cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments at december  these cash flows include both expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  year year year year year beyond total dollars in thousands long term borrowings fixed rate        floating rate       total        discontinued operations the company announced that it plans to sell its workers compensation insurance businesses which represent a separate segment of business 
therefore the results of these businesses have been reported as discontinued operations 
the company s measured value at risk of its investments from discontinued operations  a percent confidence level at december   was approximately million  out of a total market value of investments of million 
the discontinued operations businesses do not have any significant interest rate risk due to debt
