item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview for the year ended may   national semiconductor corporation national or the company had a week year 
operating results for this additional week are considered immaterial to the company s consolidated results of operations for the year ended may  fiscal and were each week years 
in november  nova acquisition corp  a subsidiary of the company  merged with cyrix corporation cyrix and cyrix became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
cyrix designs  develops and markets x software compatible microprocessors of original design for the personal computer marketplace 
the company believes that access to cyrix s x microprocessor cores and the combination of technologies resulting from the merger bring together many of the key enabling technologies necessary to achieve its system on a chip strategy to develop certain highly integrated  application specific semiconductor products for the personal systems  communications and consumer markets 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to include cyrix for all periods presented and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes results for cyrix 
during fiscal  the company also completed the acquisitions of future integrated systems  inc fis  a supplier of graphics hardware and software products for the personal computer market  and certain assets and liabilities of gulbransen  inc related to its digital audio technology business 
the company believes fis design expertise will expand its ability to integrate advanced graphics capabilities into system on a chip solutions for the personal computer market and the gulbransen audio compressor technology will expand its ability to provide digital audio building blocks for system on a chip solutions 
the company also completed the acquisition of comcore semiconductor comcore in late fiscal comcore  a designer of integrated circuits for computer networking and broadband communications  uses powerful mathematical techniques combined with advanced digital signal processing dsp and customized design methodologies to create high performance communications integrated circuits 
this technology is expected to add advanced design and technology capabilities to the company s existing analog  mixed signal and digital expertise 
the company believes that this technology will help position it as a leader in the application of advanced dsp technology for communications solutions 
results of operations the company recorded net sales of billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the decline in sales through fiscal is primarily due to the absence of sales in fiscal and lower sales in fiscal than in fiscal for the fairchild semiconductor group fairchild  which the company divested in late fiscal the company incurred a loss for fiscal of million compared to net income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decline in operating results in fiscal was primarily attributable to the absence of fairchild sales combined with special items of million 
the special items included a net million charge for restructuring of operations related to a worldwide workforce reduction announced in april  million for cyrix merger costs and million for in process r d charges related to the acquisitions of comcore million  fis million and the gulbransen digital audio technology business million 
in connection with the acquisition of comcore  the company also recorded million of unearned compensation related to employee retention arrangements  which will be charged to operations  primarily research and development  over the next three years 
the decrease in net income for fiscal from fiscal was attributable to a combination of lower sales from fairchild and special items of million 
the special items comprised million for restructuring of operations that included million related to the company s reorganization of its operating structure and million related to the planned realignment of its manufacturing facilities  plus million for in process research and development charges related to the acquisitions of the picopower division of cirrus logic inc picopower million and mediamatics  inc 
mediamatics million  offset by a million gain from the disposition of fairchild 
the company s current operating structure is organized into three business groups that include the analog group  the communications and consumer group and the cyrix group formerly known as the personal systems group  which for purposes of this discussion represent the company s core business 
the company has presented management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to include separate comparison of the company s core business 
as a result  financial information for fiscal and excludes fairchild and dynacraft  inc dci  which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes selected financial information for the national core business excluding the effect of special items and certain other nonrecurring operating items 
the company believes the exclusion of these items provides a more consistent basis for comparison of the company s results of operations 
special items included million in fiscal and million in fiscal  as previously described  and million in fiscal for an in process r d charge related to the acquisition of sitel sierra  bv sitel 
other non recurring operating items included million related to the write down of fairchild inventory and other cost reduction activities  offset by a million gain on the sale of a digital answering machine integrated circuit business in fiscal and million associated with various cost reduction programs taken to align costs with market conditions in fiscal years ended may  may  may  in millions net sales    gross profit gross margin net income diluted earnings per share the presentation of these separate national core business earnings per share eps amounts is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes  however  that for analytical purposes  these eps amounts represent the contributions of the national core business and are an appropriate basis for comparison with future financial results from the national core business 
sales while sales in fiscal decreased overall by percent from sales in fiscal  sales for national s core business of billion in fiscal increased percent over sales of billion in fiscal this increase occurred despite lower sales in the second half of the year that were caused by the slowdown in new orders affected by economic uncertainties in the asia pacific region  as well as difficulties the company encountered in ramping up adequate volumes of the cyrix media gx processor product to speed levels the market was demanding 
this growth is led by sales for analog products  which grew percent over fiscal sales and also reflects the continued growth in sales for wide area network wan products including application specific wireless communication products  which grew percent over fiscal sales 
although the company experienced a decline in new orders from personal computer manufacturers in the second half of the year  sales for personal computer products also grew slightly for the year by percent 
however  sales for local area network lan products declined by percent from fiscal  since the company did not successfully transition its lan products to a more integrated node adapter card solution 
this decline was caused by a sharp drop in sales that occurred in the second half of the year due to the company s failure to introduce key new lan products combined with decreased unit shipments and price erosion in its mature megabit lan ethernet products 
overall  sales increases were the result of increased unit shipments despite some price declines 
sales for fiscal for the asia pacific region and europe increased by percent and percent  respectively  while sales for the americas and japan decreased percent and percent  respectively 
in addition to the effect from the general economic slowdown in japan  the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales had an unfavorable impact in both japan and europe as the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen and most major european currencies 
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to approximately one fourth of the overall decline in sales 
in fiscal  sales in the asia pacific region and europe increased to percent and percent of total sales  respectively  while sales for the americas and japan declined to percent and percent of total sales 
in fiscal  sales decreased overall by percent from sales in fiscal  while sales for national s core business of billion in fiscal increased percent over sales of billion in fiscal this growth in sales was driven by the company s focus on analog and mixed signal market opportunities and reflected continued growth in sales for lan products and wan products  including application specific wireless communication products  each of which grew with increases of percent and percent  respectively  over fiscal in addition  sales strengthened for personal computer products  which grew percent over fiscal sales increases for all of these product areas were the result of increased unit shipments 
overall  increased unit shipments for the national core business resulted in increased sales for the year despite some modest price declines 
fiscal sales decreased in all geographic regions from sales in fiscal the decreases were percent for the americas  percent for europe  percent for japan and percent for the asia pacific region 
although the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales had an unfavorable impact in japan as the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen  it was offset by a generally favorable impact experienced in europe 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation contributed to approximately one third of the overall decrease in sales 
in fiscal  sales in the americas were percent of total sales  sales for japan were percent of total sales and sales for both europe and the asia pacific region were each percent of total sales 
in fiscal  the americas  europe  the asia pacific region and japan accounted for   and percent of total sales  respectively 
the disposition of fairchild had an immaterial effect on the foregoing percentages 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the primary factor contributing to the decline was reduced factory utilization 
although wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal  wafer fabrication capacity utilization declined to percent in the last month of fiscal due to the slowdown in new orders experienced in the second half of the year  which was affected by economic uncertainties in the asia pacific region and unstable conditions in the personal computer market 
significant margin erosion in cyrix products combined with significant ramp up costs associated with the new wafer fabrication facility in maine also contributed to the decline in gross margin 
for the company s core business  gross margin of percent for fiscal declined compared to percent in fiscal the results for the company s core business for fiscal exclude the effect of fairchild and certain nonrecurring operating items included in cost of sales that consisted of million for the write down of fairchild inventory to net realizable value and other cost reduction activities 
in fiscal  gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to percent from percent in fiscal the primary factor contributing to the decline was reduced factory utilization  particularly in the first half of fiscal  when factory utilization was down due to the slowdown in new orders as customers and distributors reduced inventories 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization declined to percent for the first half of fiscal resulting in gross margin of percent for the first half of the year 
although gross margin for fiscal was lower than that for fiscal  it improved over the fiscal year as factory utilization reached percent in the second half of fiscal this resulted in gross margin of percent for the second half of the year as new order rates that began improving in august strengthened through the remainder of the fiscal year 
gross margin for fiscal also reflects the positive effect of ceasing depreciation expense on the property and equipment of the fairchild businesses held for disposition 
had the company continued to record depreciation expense on those assets during the year  gross margin for the year would have been percent 
for the company s core business  gross margin of percent for fiscal declined compared to percent in fiscal research and development research and development r d expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
for the company s core business  r d expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts exclude in process r d charges of million related to the acquisitions of comcore million  fis million and the gulbransen digital audio technology business million in fiscal  million related to the acquisitions of picopower million and mediamatics million in fiscal and million related to the acquisition of sitel in fiscal  which have been separately presented in the consolidated statements of operations as special items 
overall  the increase in r d expenses reflects the company s accelerated investment in advanced submicron cmos process technology  which is part of the company s focus on state of the art process technology and has been set as one of the company s strategic imperatives 
the increase also reflects continued investment in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the personal systems  communications and consumer markets  as well as expanded development of cyrix microprocessor based products 
for fiscal  the company expended percent of its r d effort toward the development of process technology and the remaining percent for new product development 
this represents an increase of percent and percent in fiscal over fiscal in spending for process technology and product development  respectively 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal from million  or percent of sales  in fiscal and million  or percent of sales  in fiscal for the company s core business  sg a expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decreases reflect the effect of centralization initiatives implemented in connection with the company s fiscal reorganization that have reduced the company s infrastructure and certain cost reduction actions taken in the second half of fiscal to reduce the company s overall cost structure in response to current business conditions 
restructuring of operations in april  the company implemented an overall cost reduction plan due to weakened business conditions experienced in the second half of fiscal as part of the overall cost reduction plan  the company announced a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately  people  primarily in its santa clara  california  headquarters and other front end wafer manufacturing operations 
this included approximately employees affected by the previously announced closure of the company s and inch wafer manufacturing facilities in santa clara 
in addition to new cost reduction actions  the plan includes modification of certain previously announced actions related to the closure of the santa clara and inch wafer manufacturing facilities  as well as additional impairment loss related to the write down of certain assets in the micron wafer manufacturing facility in arlington  texas 
as a result  the company recorded a net million restructuring charge in fiscal the restructuring charge included approximately million for severance and lease termination costs  million for the write off of assets related to discontinued product development programs and million for the write off of assets related to discontinued process technology development 
it also included an additional million impairment loss on certain assets in the arlington wafer manufacturing facility 
the additional impairment loss was caused by weakened business conditions that significantly reduced the demand for wafers from the micron wafer manufacturing facility 
these charges were partially offset by the release of million of excess reserves for severance and other exit costs related to the company s reorganization of its operating structure announced in the first quarter of fiscal and the release of million of excess reserves for other exit costs related to the company s planned realignment of its manufacturing facilities announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the company s reorganization of its operating structure announced in june  the company recorded a million net special charge for fiscal that included a million restructuring charge for the write down of fixed assets to estimated fair value  as well as costs associated with staffing reductions and other exit costs necessary to reduce the company s infrastructure in both fairchild and the remaining national core business 
the remaining components of the million special charge were recorded in cost of sales and consisted of million for the write down of certain fairchild inventory to net realizable value and million for other cost reduction activities 
in connection with the company s planned realignment of its manufacturing facilities announced in may  the company also recorded a restructuring charge of million in fiscal that included an impairment loss of million related to the write down of certain assets in its arlington wafer manufacturing facility 
this impairment arose from the company s decision to cancel further investment in its inch  micron wafer fabrication expansion that began in the company s acceleration of investment in its inch wafer fabrication facility in maine  which has resulted in availability of micron capacity sooner than previously expected  has significantly reduced the company s requirements for micron capacity 
in addition to the impairment loss  the company also recorded million of exit costs primarily related to the closure of its and inch wafer fabrication facilities in santa clara 
the closure process  which began in may  is expected to be completed within the next months  during which time the company will transfer remaining production activities to other existing manufacturing lines 
the exit costs primarily related to severance costs  the removal of production equipment and the dismantling of the production facilities 
approximately employees were employed in these two wafer fabrication facilities and the company does not expect to place the majority of the affected employees elsewhere in the organization 
the company also recorded million of exit costs associated with the company s decision to halt expansion of its inch wafer fabrication line in greenock  scotland 
these costs primarily related to the write off of previously capitalized construction in progress costs and other exit costs  including employee related costs 
the remaining million is related to severance and other exit costs at other manufacturing facilities 
at may   approximately million was included in accrued liabilities for cash restructuring charges  primarily comprised of severance for those actions that have not yet been completed 
all actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of calendar interest income and interest expense net interest income was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to the combination of increased interest earned on higher average cash balances offset by less interest expense from lower debt balances 
higher average cash balances in fiscal were the result of the proceeds received from the disposition of fairchild in late fiscal lower debt balances in fiscal primarily resulted from the redemption of the large majority of cyrix convertible subordinated notes in january  in addition to other general debt repayment 
in addition  the company capitalized million of interest associated with capital expansion projects in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net interest income was lower in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to higher interest expense while interest income remained constant 
interest expense in fiscal was higher due to additional interest related to the million cyrix convertible subordinated notes 
other income  net other income  net was million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  other income  net included million of net intellectual property income  of which million related to a significant licensing agreement with a korean firm and a million gain from investments primarily arising from the sale of stock from the company s investment holdings 
this compares to million of net intellectual property income  plus a million net gain from the sale of stock from the company s investment holdings  a million gain from the sale of a digital answering machine integrated circuit business  a million receipt from the settlement of litigation and million of dividend income from an investment holding  offset by million for the write down of a nonmarketable equity investment to net realizable value during fiscal other income  net for fiscal included net intellectual property income of million  a million receipt from the settlement of litigation  a million net gain from the sale of investment holdings and a million gain from the sale of dci  offset by million for the write down of certain investments to net realizable value 
intellectual property income declined in fiscal  because several large license arrangements expired in fiscal aside from the one licensing agreement in fiscal with the korean firm  none of the other license agreements in fiscal were considered individually material and none of the license arrangements in either fiscal or fiscal was considered individually material 
income tax expense the company had an income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was percent as compared to approximately percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively 
excluding the special charge for in process research and development primarily related to the acquisition of comcore  which is not tax deductible  the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was percent 
foreign operations the company s foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in southeast asia and europe and sales offices throughout southeast asia  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities are denominated in local currency  which exposes the company to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s risk exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities is concentrated in pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions are hedged  where practical  using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
the company s risk exposure from foreign revenue is limited to the japanese yen and major european currencies  primarily german deutsche marks  french francs and italian lira 
the company hedges up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is  at times  hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
financial market risks the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of the company s investment portfolio 
the company s fixed rate debt obligations and related interest rate swap agreements are subject to interest rate risk with minimal impact 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of the company s debt obligations 
a decrease in interest rates would favorably benefit the company  but would not necessarily result in a material decrease in interest expense as the company s obligation under the interest rate swap agreements is based on us dollar libor rates 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and certain other asian and european currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  the company has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in certain asian currencies and percent in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s balances as of may  financial condition as of may   cash and short term investments decreased to a total of million from a total of million at may  cash generated from operating activities was million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in working capital as a result of an increase in inventories and a decrease in income taxes payable 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal  the company s investing activities were primarily represented by capital expenditures of million and business acquisitions of million 
for fiscal  capital expenditures of million were offset by cash proceeds of million from the disposition of fairchild and million from the sale of the fairchild note receivable  which resulted in less cash used for investing activities compared to fiscal and also fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal were at slightly higher levels than fiscal as the company continued to invest in property  plant and equipment to expand its manufacturing capabilities 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily included construction of the inch  micron wafer fabrication facility in south portland  maine 
the company s financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the proceeds of a million draw down on new and existing equipment loans and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
these amounts were offset by the million redemption of substantially all of the cyrix convertible subordinated notes in january and million of other general debt repayment 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily from the proceeds of a million issuance of the cyrix convertible subordinated notes  million for the draw down on a new equipment loan and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
these amounts were offset by general debt repayment of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily due to the proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from the private placement of the company s convertible subordinated notes and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  which were offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock on the open market for million 
management foresees substantial cash outlays for plant and equipment throughout fiscal with primary focus on capacity expansion in the maine inch wafer fabrication facility  next generation process capability and implementation and expansion of in house assembly and test capacity for cyrix microprocessors 
however  the fiscal capital expenditure level is expected to be significantly lower than the fiscal level in response to current business conditions 
existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  are expected to be sufficient to finance planned fiscal capital investments

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial statements 
both sfas no 
and no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is presently analyzing all of these statements and has not yet determined their impact on the company s financial statements 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook and in the financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis are forward looking based on current expectations and management s estimates 
actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and more integrated products 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
in addition  substantial capital and r d investment is required to support products and manufacturing processes 
as a result of these industry conditions  the company may experience periodic fluctuations in its operating results 
the company s strategy is to provide system on a chip solutions for its key data highway strategic partners  exploiting its analog expertise as a starting point for forward integration 
as a result of this focus  the company expects to grow at or above market rates of growth in particular segments of the analog  mixed signal and microprocessor markets 
business conditions for the semiconductor industry and the company significantly weakened in the second half of fiscal  in part due to the recent economic downturn in the asia pacific region 
the company experienced a slowdown in order rates  particularly with certain personal computer manufacturers where new orders that were seasonally down after the christmas holidays remained down through the end of the year as customers continued to reduce inventory levels of their end product 
although the company has seen some signs that new orders in its analog and wireless businesses have stabilized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the level of new orders has been lower than historically experienced and unless the rate of orders improves  the company will be unable to attain the level of revenues experienced in fiscal additionally  the rate of orders and product pricing may be affected by continued and increasing competition and by growth rates in the personal computer and networking industries 
further  while the company develops its dsp based physical layer lan products  revenue for lan products is expected to decline as a result of decreasing revenue from previous generation lan products that are approaching the end of their product lives 
although the company expects the dsp based physical layer solutions to be successful  until the product transition is completed and new products have received customer acceptance  revenue for lan products will remain below the levels experienced in the first half of fiscal continued delay in the introduction of new lan products will result in both reduced lan revenue and a significant unfavorable effect on the company s operating performance 
the company also believes the direction in the personal computer industry to accelerate product migration toward sub  personal computers may  in the short run  unfavorably impact revenues for the company s other products in the area of chipsets  super i o products and temperature sensors 
the company remains very cautious about its future outlook  particularly with respect to the personal computer business 
as a result  the company expects overall revenues  particularly for the first half of fiscal  to be down from the level of revenues recorded in the second half of fiscal  resulting in a significant net loss for the first half of fiscal while business conditions and overall market pricing have a major influence on gross margin  the company s accelerated investment in advanced cmos process technology  improvements in manufacturing efficiency  realignment of wafer fabrication facilities and introduction of new products are expected to result in future gross margin improvement 
future gross margin improvement is also predicated on increased new order rates  particularly in the higher margin multi market analog products 
future gross margin is also affected by wafer fabrication capacity utilization 
although the company has brought on new manufacturing capacity in fiscal with the completion of its new wafer manufacturing facility in maine  the company has also experienced a significant decline in wafer fabrication capacity utilization due to the current slowdown in new orders 
while management expects to more fully utilize wafer capacity  unless new orders improve significantly  the company will continue to run its manufacturing facilities at reduced capacity utilization rates in order to manage inventories and reduce cost 
there is no certainty that the level of demand will be sufficient to fully utilize the additional new capacity 
failure to improve manufacturing capacity utilization will lead to decreased gross margin for fiscal the company s focus is to continue to introduce new products  particularly more highly integrated system on a chip products 
if the development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future gross margin may also be unfavorably affected 
in connection with the company s planned comprehensive realignment of its manufacturing facilities  the company faces the risk that the transfer of product manufacturing from existing facilities that are to be closed or where capacity levels are to be reduced may extend beyond the estimated transition period and that the transition process may not occur smoothly  resulting in an unfavorable impact on future gross margin and operating results 
the company believes that continued focused investment in research and development  especially on the development of new manufacturing processes and the timely development and market acceptance of new products is a key factor to the company s successful growth and its ability to achieve strong financial performance 
ongoing research and development spending for fiscal is expected to be slightly lower than fiscal levels as management continues to adjust its strategic research and development programs to align its spending with current business conditions 
national s product portfolio  particularly products in the personal systems and communications area  have short product life cycles and successfully developing and introducing new products are critical to the company s ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
the company also expects overall sg a expenses to be lower for fiscal than for fiscal as the full benefit of the cost reduction actions implemented in fiscal takes effect 
in november  the company completed the merger of its subsidiary with cyrix 
the company believes the technologies and capabilities of cyrix and national are complementary 
however  in the second half of fiscal the company experienced lower volume and price erosion with the cyrix x products and difficulties with ramping up production of the cyrix media gx product 
the integration of the two companies operations may have a further unfavorable impact on operating results if the company encounters additional unforeseen obstacles or is unable to successfully complete its integration plan 
other factors related to the cyrix business that may affect the company s results of operations include the following cyrix is a small competitor in the personal computer market for socket seven compatible microprocessor products where other large competitors such as intel corporation  advanced micro devices  inc and international business machines corporation significantly influence the price and availability of products 
there is also the risk that the company will not be able to sell existing levels of cyrix product at a profit due to the current trend in product migration in the personal computer industry toward shorter product life cycles and more rapid price erosion for microprocessors 
the shorter product life cycles and rapid decline in prices of microprocessors may also result in excess inventory of cyrix products  which may result in decreased future gross margin and operating results 
in addition  severe price declines in the socket seven compatible microprocessor market may reduce the competitive position of the company s proprietary media gx family of integrated microprocessors 
this could also result in excess inventory of cyrix products  as well as reduced future gross margin and operating results 
cyrix is heavily dependent on quarterly turns orders  which are orders that book and bill in the same quarter 
the company is also currently dependent on a third party wafer foundry to manufacture cyrix products and this can result in lack of control over the yield distribution of acceptable speed levels on cyrix microprocessor products that may unfavorably impact product availability 
the company expects to commence the manufacturing of cyrix product in house to utilize the company s micron process capacity in its inch wafer fabrication facility in maine 
as a result  the company faces the risk of encountering difficulties in its effort to bring up the manufacturing capability for cyrix products  which may unfavorably affect the company s future operating results 
national continues to pursue opportunities to leverage its intellectual property 
however  the timing and amount of future licensing income over time cannot be forecast with certainty 
in addition  the company expects to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire key technology to augment its technical capability or to achieve faster time to market as alternatives to internally developing such technology 
in addition to the company s regular involvement in licensing arrangements and joint venture relationships  these opportunities are expected to include business acquisitions 
with such acquisitions  there is a risk that future operating performance may be unfavorably affected due to acquisition related costs  such as but not limited to  in process r d charges  added r d expenses  lower gross margins from acquired product portfolios and restructure costs associated with duplicate facilities 
because of significant international operations  the company benefits overall from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
as such  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may unfavorably affect the company s consolidated sales and net income 
the company attempts to manage the short term exposures to foreign currency fluctuations  but there can be no assurance that the company s risk management activities will offset the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange 
in connection with the fairchild transaction  fairchild and the company have entered into a manufacturing agreement under which the company will purchase goods and services from fairchild through june prior to march  these goods and services had been provided by fairchild at cost 
under the agreement  the company has committed to purchase manufacturing services based on specified terms 
the agreement also requires the company to purchase a minimum of million in goods and services based on declining annual minimum levels over the term of the agreement 
the company is committed to these minimum levels whether or not the minimum levels are required based on future demand 
to the extent the minimum levels exceed future demand  the company s gross margin and operating results will be unfavorably affected 
the company also has certain continuing obligations arising from the fairchild transaction that include providing certain transition services to fairchild and indemnification of certain environmental and legal matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate satisfaction of these obligations would not have a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the agreement with fairchild  the company has agreements with certain other wafer fabrication suppliers whereby it has made prepayments to purchase products and has been required to purchase capital equipment for one supplier 
in the event the company is unable to consume sufficient volumes of product necessary to reduce the existing prepaid balances  the company s future operating results would be unfavorably impacted 
the company has received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries within which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that these governments or other government entities will not serve future notices of assessments on the company  or that the amounts of such assessments and the failure of the company to favorably resolve such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company is engaged in tax litigation with the irs and the company s tax returns for certain years are under examination in the us and malaysia 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of the tax proceedings or tax examinations would not have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
as part of a company wide program to address year issues  national has implemented a number of remediation projects 
business applications and computer systems that support its day to day operations are currently being tested to ensure that they will be year compliant 
the company utilizes many third party software packages that have already been rendered year compliant 
to a large extent  in house systems developed since have been programmed to properly deal with year issues 
as a result  efforts required to modify the company s business systems have been minimized 
the company is examining and taking steps to ensure that its manufacturing processes will not be interrupted and that its facilities infrastructure will not experience any failures or difficulties as a result of year issues 
the company is also reviewing its current product portfolio to identify any year issues and  where appropriate  will be communicating with its major customers 
while there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not be encountered  the company expects that all projects will be completed in a timely manner
