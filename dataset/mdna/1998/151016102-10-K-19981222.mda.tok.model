the impact on sales volume and operating results  due to the timing and extent of these factors  can be significant 
liquidity and capital resources the operations of the company historically have been funded with a combination of internally generated funds and external borrowings 
other than funding ongoing operations  the company s principal uses of funds in the future will be the development of new or existing tea and dietary supplement products and the possible acquisition of brands  product lines or other assets 
the company expects its primary sources of financing for its future business activities will be funds from operations plus borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the company currently believes that funds from operations and funds expected to be available under the company s credit facility are likely to be sufficient to meet operating and capital requirements unless a significant acquisition is made 
on november  the company entered into a new three year credit facility which includes a revolving credit loan of up to  the revolving loan  and a standby letter of credit commitment in the approximate amount of  the letter of credit facility to support outstanding economic development revenue bonds issued to finance the company s manufacturing facility 
borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at rates ranging from libor plus to the federal funds rate plus  subject to increases if the company fails to achieve certain future operating results 
the letter of credit facility includes annual financing fees of  and loans resulting from a draw under the letter of credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the revolving loan 
the revolving loan is due on november  and the letter of credit facility expires on november  the credit facility imposes certain ratio maintenance requirements on the company  including minimum ebitda levels  interest coverage  current ratio and net worth  and certain restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness  liens  sales of assets  mergers and investments

cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in cash used in operating activities of the company was million

the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately million in financing activities of the company provided cash of million for year compliance a number of computer programs are written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company  after an inventory of its business systems and business interactions  is currently executing a plan to prepare its systems and business relationships for the year although the exact steps and timing vary depending upon component type  the company expects to complete its plan of preparation for all components on or around july  in the event there is a delay in the completion of the year compliance plan  the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan which will include some non computerized backup systems 
the ability for the company to achieve year compliance is  however  highly dependent upon compliance of the systems of the company s customers  suppliers and other third parties with which the company has business relationships 
the total cost to the company of year compliance activities has not yet been  and is not anticipated to be  material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
these costs  and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modification and testing processes  are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans
