item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
ingram micro s worldwide supplier list includes almost all of the leading microcomputer hardware manufacturers  networking equipment manufacturers  and software publishers such as acer  apple computer  cisco systems  compaq computer  corel  epson  hewlett packard  ibm  intel  iomega  microsoft  nec  novell  seagate  sun microsystems  symantec  com  toshiba  viewsonic  and western digital 
the company s suppliers generally warrant the products distributed by the company and allow the company to return defective products  including those that have been returned to the company by its customers 
the company does not independently warrant the products it distributes  however  the company has recently begun to warrant the following i its services with regard to products which it configures for its customers  and ii products which it builds to order from components purchased from other sources 
the company s business  like that of other wholesale distributors  is subject to the risk that the value of its inventory will be affected adversely by suppliers price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising the inventory 
it is the policy of most suppliers of microcomputer products to protect distributors  such as the company  who purchase directly from such suppliers  from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the supplier s price reductions 
however  major pc suppliers have stated that it is their intent to reduce the amount of inventory in the channel  particularly in light of the growth of channel assembly strategies 
consequently  if major pc suppliers substantially decrease the availability of price protection to wholesale distributors  such change in policy could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has written distribution agreements with many of its suppliers  however  these agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which ingram micro is permitted to distribute the products 
the agreements are also generally short term  subject to periodic renewal  and often contain provisions permitting termination by either party without cause upon relatively short notice 
the company does not believe that its business is substantially dependent on the terms of any such agreements 
under the terms of many distribution agreements  suppliers will credit the distributor for declines in inventory value resulting from the supplier s price reductions if the distributor complies with certain conditions 
in addition  under many such agreements  the distributor has the right to return for credit or exchange for other products a portion of those inventory items purchased  within a designated period of time 
a supplier who elects to terminate a distribution agreement generally will repurchase from the distributor the supplier s products carried in the distributor s inventory 
while the industry practices discussed above are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect the company in all cases from declines in inventory value  management believes that these practices provide a significant level of protection from such declines 
no assurance can be given  however  that such practices will continue or that they will adequately protect the company against declines in inventory value 
the company s risk of inventory loss could be greater outside the united states  where agreements with suppliers are more restrictive with regard to price protection and the company s ability to return unsold inventory 
the company establishes reserves for estimated losses due to obsolete inventory in the normal course of business 
historically  the company has not experienced losses due to obsolete inventory materially in excess of established inventory reserves 
outsourcing and value added programs ingram micro offers a myriad of programs and services to its suppliers and reseller customers as an integral part of its wholesaling efforts 
the company categorizes these services into value added wholesale distribution and for fee services 
together  these services are intended to link reseller customers and suppliers to ingram micro as a one stop provider of microcomputer products and related services  while meeting demand by suppliers and resellers to outsource non core business activities and thereby lower their operating costs 
the company s value added wholesaling services are an important complement to its distribution activities and include pre and post sale technical support  order fulfillment  financing programs  product demo evaluation  and on site service and support 
in addition to these value added wholesaling services  the company offers a variety of for fee services for its reseller customers and suppliers 
these services include contract warehousing  contract telesales  contract credit accounts receivable management  contract inventory management  and contract technical support for customers 
the company is focused on identifying and developing services that directly meet reseller customer and supplier needs 
all of these services are currently available in the company s us operations 
the degree of implementation of these value added services in ingram micro s operations outside the united states varies depending on particular market circumstances 
although the company believes that value added services are important as a complement to its core business  such services do not  and are not in the future expected to  generate a material percentage of the company s net sales 
see frameworks total integration services below 
in addition  such value added services do not  and are not in the future expected to  require a material portion of the company s resources 
frameworks total integration services to better serve both global and regional customers  the company introduced frameworks total integration services frameworks  a worldwide channel assembly and configuration initiative that is anticipated to deliver customized  fully tested computer systems to its reseller customers 
frameworks is designed to provide fast  flexible build to order capabilities including custom configuration capabilities  competitive pricing on oem components to facilitate assembly and configuration efforts by the company s reseller customers  and drop ship functionality 
in addition  frameworks material planning systems and just in time procurement are designed to enable ingram micro to ship components and finished systems within three to five days of order 
the company plans to sell the assembled systems and products to all customer sectors  including consumer  commercial and var customers 
to support this global initiative  the company opened a new  square foot global integration center in memphis  tennessee in march information systems the company s core information system  impulse  is central to its ability to provide superior execution to its customers  and as such  the company believes that it represents an important competitive advantage 
ingram micro s systems are primarily mainframe based in order to provide the high level of scalability and performance required to manage such a large and complex business operation 
impulse is a single  standardized  real time information system and operating environment  used across substantially all of the company s worldwide operations 
it has been customized as necessary for use in almost all countries in which the company operates and has the capability to handle multiple languages and currencies 
on a daily basis  the company s systems typically handle million on line transactions   orders  and  shipments 
the company has designed impulse as a scalable system that has the capability to support increased transaction volume 
the overall on line response time for the company s network of over  user stations terminals  printers  personal computers  and radio frequency hand held terminals is less than one second 
worldwide  ingram micro s centralized processing system supports more than operational functions including receiving  customer management  order processing  shipping  inventory management  and accounting 
at the core of the impulse system is on line  real time distribution software to which considerable enhancements and modifications have been made to support the company s growth and its low cost business model 
the company makes extensive use of advanced telecommunications technologies with customer service enhancing features  such as automatic call distribution to route customer calls to the telesales representatives 
the telesales department relies on its sales wizard system for on line  real time tracking of all customer calls  for proactive outbound calling  and for status reports on sales statistics such as number of customer calls  customer call intentions  and total sales generated 
impulse allows the company s telesales representatives to deliver real time information on product pricing  inventory  availability  and order status to reseller customers 
the sales adjusted gross profit sagp pricing system enables telesales representatives to make informed pricing decisions through access to specific product and order related costs for each order 
in the united states  the company has implemented cti technology  which provides the telesales representatives with automatic number identification capability and advanced telecommunications features such as on screen call waiting and automatic call return  thereby reducing the time required to process customer orders 
to complement ingram micro s telesales  customer service  and technical support capabilities  impulse offers a number of different electronic products and services through which customers can conduct business with the company  such as the customer automated purchasing system caps  electronic data interchange edi  the bulletin board service  and the ingram micro web site 
the company s latest additions to its electronic commerce capabilities are its internet based electronic catalog  in depth library  and auction block 
the electronic catalog provides reseller customers with real time access to product pricing and availability  with the capability to search by product category  name  or manufacturer 
the in depth library is a comprehensive multi manufacturer database of timely and accurate product  sales  marketing  and technical information  which is updated nightly for new information 
auction block is a real time  on line bidding service that allows reseller customers to competitively bid on unopened products that are not returnable to the suppliers eg  discontinued products  products with cosmetic damage to their packaging  returned products not conforming to supplier s return policies  etc the company s warehouse operations use extensive bar coding technology and radio frequency technology for receiving and shipping  and real time links to ups and fedex for freight processing and shipment tracking 
the customer service department uses the power system for on line documentation and faster processing of customer product returns 
to ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained  the company s buyers depend on the purchasing system to track inventory on a continual basis 
many other features of impulse help to expedite the order processing cycle and reduce operating costs for the company as well as its reseller customers and suppliers 
the company employs various security measures and backup systems designed to protect against unauthorized use or failure of its information systems 
access to the company s information systems is controlled through the use of passwords and additional security measures are taken with respect to especially sensitive information 
the company has a five year contract with sungard recovery services for disaster recovery and twice per year performs a complete systems test  including applications and database integrity 
in addition  the company has backup power sources for emergency power and also has the capability to automatically reroute incoming calls  such as from its santa ana west coast sales facility to its buffalo east coast sales facility 
the company has not in the past experienced significant failures or downtime of impulse or any of its other information systems  but any such failure or significant downtime could prevent the company from taking customer orders  printing product pick lists  and or shipping product and could prevent customers from accessing price and product availability information from the company 
as is the case with many computer software systems  some of the company s systems use two digit data fields which recognize dates using the assumption that the first two digits are ie  the number is recognized as the year 
therefore  the company s date critical functions relating to the year and beyond  such as sales  distribution  purchasing  inventory control  facilities  and financial systems  may be severely affected unless changes are made to these computer systems 
with the assistance of an outside consultant  the company commenced a review of the company s internal systems in mid to identify applications that are not year ready and to assess the impact of the year problem 
the company has developed an overall plan and a systematic process to modify its internal systems to be year ready 
the company commenced remediation of its mainframe programs in early to comply with year requirements 
the company anticipates that the other required year modifications will be made on a timely basis and does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material effect on the company s operating results 
however  the company faces risks to the extent that suppliers of products including components for its channel assembly and configuration initiative  services including services provided by independent shipping companies  and business on a worldwide basis may not have business systems or products that comply with year requirements 
in the event any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services or systems that meet year requirements in a timely manner  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that these or other factors relating to year compliance issues  including litigation  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
non us operations and export sales operations outside the united states 
the company  through its subsidiaries  operates in a number of countries outside of the united states  including brazil  canada  chile  mexico  norway  peru  switzerland  and most countries of the european union 
in   and    and  respectively  of the company s net sales were derived from operations outside of the united states 
the company expects its international net sales to increase as a percentage of total net sales in the future  due to organic growth as well as growth from acquisitions such as that of computek in latin america 
in addition  the company purchased a minority interest in electronic resources  a distributor of information technology products in the asia pacific region 
the company s net sales from operations outside the united states are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  the company s operations outside the united states impose risks upon its business as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
although the company attempts to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its business  primarily by attempting to match the currencies of sales and costs  as well as through the use of foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts  the company does not seek to remove all risk associated with such fluctuations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations in the future 
in certain countries outside the united states  operations are accounted for primarily on a us dollar denominated basis 
in the event of an unexpected devaluation of the local currency in those countries as occurred in mexico in december and more recently in in asia and latin america  the company may experience significant foreign exchange losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operations outside the united states are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  political instability  trade restrictions  tariff changes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices 
these risks are more prevalent in regions where the economic and political environments are less stable than in more stable areas such as canada and western europe 
as the company continues to expand its international business  its success will be dependent  in part  on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or its business  financial condition  and results of operations as a whole 
export markets 
the company s export operations continue to serve those markets where the company does not have a stand alone  in country presence 
the miami  florida  santa ana  california  and brussels  belgium export operations which have been reorganized as part of the latin america  us and european operations  respectively serve more than  resellers in over countries 
in addition  the export branch in latin america has field sales representatives based in buenos aires  argentina  bogota  colombia  and quito  ecuador 
the export branch in santa ana also has field sales representatives based in tokyo  japan 
for segment information regarding the company s united states and international operations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive environment  both in the united states and internationally 
the microcomputer products distribution industry is characterized by intense competition  based primarily on price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and breadth of product lines and service  and availability of technical and product information 
the company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors 
in addition  the company believes that outsourcing and value added capabilities such as channel assembly  configuration  innovative financing programs  and order fulfillment program will become more important competitive factors 
the company is constantly seeking to expand its business into areas closely related to its core microcomputer products distribution business 
as the company enters new business areas  it may encounter increased competition from current competitors and or from new competitors  some of which may be current customers of the company 
for example  the company intends to distribute media in the new digital video disc format and may compete with traditional music and printed media distributors 
also  as electronic purchases of software become more prevalent in the industry  electronic software distributors may become significant competitors of the company 
in addition  certain services the company provides may directly compete with those provided by the company s reseller customers 
there can be no assurance that increased competition and adverse reaction from customers resulting from the company s expansion into new business areas will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
ingram micro s us competitors include full line distributors tech data and merisel  as well as specialty distributors such as arrow electronics a worldwide industrial electronics distributor  avnet  access graphics a ge capital company  synnex information technologies  and sed international 
the principal competitors to the ingram alliance program include microage  datago operated by synnex  inacom  and tech data elect  a division of tech data 
ingram micro competes internationally with a variety of national and regional distributors 
european competitors include international distributors such as computer owned by german conglomerate viag ag  chs electronics  and tech data softmart and macrotron  and several regional and local distributors  including actebis  scribona  and metrologie 
in canada  ingram micro competes with merisel  globelle  beamscope  and tech data 
in mexico  ingram dicom is the leading distributor  competing with such companies as mps  chs electronics  dataflux and intertec 
in november ingram micro expanded its reach into other latin american markets by acquiring the distribution firm computek 
as a result  ingram micro competes in latin america with international distributors including chs electronics  computer  tech data  and several regional and local distributors including sonda beamscope sa in the asia pacific market  ingram micro through a minority interest in electronic resources faces both regional and local competitors  of whom the largest are tech pacific  a subsidiary of hagemeyer  which operates in more than five asian markets  and sis distribution ltd  a hong kong based distributor of microcomputer products 
ingram micro also competes with hardware manufacturers and software publishers that sell directly to reseller customers and end users 
asset management the company maintains sufficient quantities of product inventories to achieve high order fill rates 
the company believes that the risks associated with slow moving and obsolete inventory are substantially mitigated by price protection and stock return privileges provided by suppliers 
in the event of a supplier price reduction  the company generally receives a credit for products in its inventory 
in addition  the company has the right to return a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection  stock return privileges  and inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of decline in the value of inventory 
however  major pc suppliers have stated that it is their intention to reduce the amount of inventory in the channel  particularly in light of the growth of channel assembly strategies 
consequently  if major pc suppliers substantially decrease the availability of price protection to wholesale distributors  such change in policy could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s risk of decline in the value of inventory could be greater outside the united states  where agreements with suppliers are more restrictive with regard to price protection and the company s ability to return unsold inventory 
the company establishes reserves for estimated losses due to obsolete inventory in the normal course of business 
historically  the company has not experienced losses due to obsolete inventory materially in excess of established inventory reserves 
inventory levels may vary from period to period  due in part to the addition of new suppliers or new lines with current suppliers and large cash purchases of inventory due to advantageous terms offered by suppliers 
in addition  payment terms with inventory suppliers may vary from time to time  and could result in less inventory being financed by vendors and a greater amount of inventory being financed by the company s debt 
the company offers various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as prepay  credit card  and cod terms 
the company closely monitors customers credit worthiness through its on line computer system which contains detailed information on each customer s payment history and other relevant information 
in addition  the company participates in a national credit association which exchanges credit rating information on customers of association members 
in most markets  the company utilizes various levels of credit insurance to allow sales expansion and control credit risks 
the company establishes reserves for estimated credit losses in the normal course of business 
historically  the company has not experienced credit losses materially in excess of established credit loss reserves 
however  if the company s receivables experience a substantial deterioration in their collectibility or the company cannot obtain credit insurance at reasonable rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted

certain of these marks are registered  or are in the process of being registered  in the united states and various other countries 
even though the company s marks may not be registered in every country where the company conducts business  in many cases the company has acquired rights in those marks because of its continued use of them 
management believes that the value of the company s marks is increasing with the development of its business  but that the business of the company as a whole is not materially dependent on such marks 
safe harbor for forward looking information the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as such information is identified as forward looking and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statement 
except for historical information  certain statements contained in this annual report on form k may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
in order to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act  the company identifies the following important factors which could affect the company s actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those projected  forecasted  estimated  budgeted or otherwise expressed by the company in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company intense competition may lead to reduced prices and lower gross margins 
the company s narrow margins magnify the impact on operating results of variations in operating costs 
a number of factors may reduce the company s margins even further 
for example  if the company s receivables experience a substantial deterioration in their collectibility or the company cannot obtain credit insurance at reasonable rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
seasonal variations in the demand for products and services  as well as the introduction of new products  may cause variations in the company s quarterly results 
the availability or lack thereof of capital on acceptable terms may hamper the company in its efforts to fund its increasing working capital needs 
the failure of the company to adequately manage its growth may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
a failure of the company s information systems may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
devaluation of a foreign currency  or other disruption of a foreign market  may adversely impact the company s operations in that country 
the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee may adversely impact the company s operations 
the inability of the company to obtain products on favorable terms may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the company s operations may be adversely impacted by an acquisition that i is not suited for the company  ii is improperly executed  or iii substantially increases the company s debt 
the company s financial condition may be adversely impacted by a decline in value of a portion of the company s inventory 
the failure of certain shipping companies to deliver product to the company  or from the company to its customers  may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
rapid technological change may alter the market for the company s products and services  requiring the company to anticipate such technological changes  to the extent possible 
the failure of the company or its vendors  resellers  customers  shipping companies  and other third party systems to achieve substantial year compliance may adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company s inventory suppliers terminate or substantially reduce the subsidies relating to floor planning financing for the company s master reseller business  such change in policy could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
reference is made to exhibit hereto for additional discussion of the foregoing factors  as well as additional factors which may affect the company s actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those projected  forecasted  estimated  budgeted or otherwise expressed in forward looking statements
