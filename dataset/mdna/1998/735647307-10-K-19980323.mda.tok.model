is a delaware corporation incorporated in as the successor to a new york corporation incorporated in the company s principal offices are located at underhill boulevard  syosset  new york  telephone number  references to the company include its subsidiaries  unless the context indicates otherwise 
products operations support systems 
oss systems are used primarily by telephone operating companies 
the company s principal oss system is a computer based testing product the line condition report  lcr system which is a major item of capital equipment and typically sells for prices ranging from several hundred thousand to several million dollars 
the company also manufactures and sells a number of other products  primarily software based  which are used in testing  maintenance  provisioning and repair of telephone equipment 
the lcr  introduced in the mid s  was the first computer controlled electronic system used to automatically test for and diagnose problems in customer telephone lines and to notify telephone company service personnel of required maintenance 
the associated mechanized line record mlr database system provides automated record keeping including repair and disposition records and analyzes these records for identification of recurring problems and equipment deterioration 
the company s lcr systems are sold to telephone operating companies in a number of foreign countries as well as in the united states 
the company s software  which can be packaged and integrated with the lcr  provides additional oss functions  such as the automated assignment of telephone company facilities and activation of service 
in addition  pursuant to certain contracts with customers  the company develops software to meet specific customer requirements 
the company s oss products are complex and  in most applications  incorporate features designed to respond to the purchaser s operational requirements and the particular characteristics of the purchaser s telephone system 
as a result  the negotiation of a contract for an oss system is an individualized and highly technical process 
in addition  contracts for oss systems frequently provide for manufacturing  delivery  installation  testing and purchaser acceptance phases  which take place over periods ranging from several months to a year or more 
such contracts typically contain performance guarantees by the company and clauses imposing penalties on the company if in service dates are not met 
the installation  testing and purchaser acceptance phases of these contracts may last longer than contemplated by the contracts and  accordingly  amounts due under the contracts may not be collected for extended periods 
delays in purchaser acceptance of the systems and in the company s receipt of final contract payments have occurred in connection with a number of foreign sales 
in addition  the company has not experienced a steady or predictable flow of orders for oss systems 
telecommunications connection equipment 
the company s copper connection protection equipment and systems are used by telephone operating companies  by owners of private telecommunications equipment and by manufacturers and suppliers of telephone central office and customer premises equipment 
products of the types comprising the company s line of telecommunications connection equipment are included as integral parts of all domestic and foreign telephone and telecommunications systems 
such products are sold in a worldwide market  which generally grows in proportion to increases in the number of telephone subscribers and owners of private telecommunications equipment  as well as to increases in upgrades to modern digital switching technology 
the company s connection equipment consists of connector blocks and protection modules used by telephone companies to interconnect copper based subscriber lines to switching equipment lines 
the protector modules protect central office personnel and equipment from electrical surges 
the need for protection products has increased as a result of the worldwide move to digital technology  which is extremely sensitive to damage by electrical overloads  and because private owners of telecommunications equipment now have the responsibility to protect their equipment from damage caused by electrical surges 
line connecting protecting equipment usually incorporates protector modules to safeguard equipment and personnel from injury due to power surges 
currently  these products include a variety of connector blocks  protector modules and frames used in telephone central switching offices  pbx installations and multiple user facilities 
the company also has developed an assortment of frames for use in conjunction with the company s traditional line of connecting protecting products 
frames for the interconnection of copper circuits are specially designed structures which  when equipped with connector blocks and protectors  interconnect and protect telephone lines and distribute them in an orderly fashion allowing access for repairs and changes in line connections 
one of the company s frame products  the cam frame  is designed to produce computer assisted analysis and for the optimum placement of connections for telephone lines on the connector blocks mounted on the frame 
the company s copper connection protection products are used by several of the six regional bell holding companies as well as by independent telephone operating companies in the united states and owners of private telecommunications equipment 
these products are also purchased by other companies for inclusion within their systems 
in addition  the company s telecommunications connection products have been sold to telephone operating companies in various foreign countries 
this equipment is compatible with existing telephone systems both within and outside the united states and can generally be used without modification  although the company does design modifications to accommodate the specific needs of its customers 
signal processing products 
the company s signal processing products include data bus system and wideband transformers 
data bus systems  which are the communication standard for military and aerospace systems  require an extremely high level of reliability and performance 
wideband transformers are required for ground noise elimination in video imaging systems and are used in the television and broadcast  medical imaging and industrial process control industries 
the table below shows  for the last three fiscal years  the contribution made to the company s sales by each of its major categories of the telecommunications industry sales by product category years ended december  dollars in thousands oss systems    line connecting protecting equipment    signal processing    other total    includes sales of fiber optics products of  in and  in the assets comprising the fiber optics business unit were sold in march markets for the company s products the company supplies equipment and systems to telephone companies used to provide improved services to their customers 
in addition  the company provides businesses with systems  which improve their internal telecommunication systems 
typically  telephone networks in certain regions of the world  notably latin america  eastern europe and certain areas in the asia pacific region  utilize telephone switching systems which use analog technology 
these networks were designed to carry voice traffic and are not well suited for high speed data transmissions or for other forms of telecommunications that operate more effectively with digital telecommunications equipment and lines 
the telephone networks in these countries are also characterized by a very low ratio of telephone lines to population 
countries with emerging telecommunication networks have to rapidly add access lines in order to increase the availability of telephone service among its population and to significantly upgrade the quality of the lines already in service 
the company s oss systems are designed to meet many of the needs of a rapidly changing telephone network 
oss systems facilitate rapid change and expansion without a comparable increase in the requirement for skilled technicians  while the computerized line test system insures increased quality and rapid maintenance and repair of subscriber local loops 
the automated database  which computerizes the inventory and maintenance history of all subscriber lines in service  helps to keep the rapid change under control 
during  approximately of the company s sales consisted of oss products 
as a telephone company expands the number of its subscriber lines  it also requires connection equipment to interconnect and protect those lines in its central offices 
the company provides a line of copper connection equipment for this purpose 
recent trends towards the transmission of high frequency signals on copper lines are sustaining this market 
less developed countries  such as those with emerging networks or those upgrading to digital switching systems  provide a growing market for copper connection and protection equipment 
the increased sensitivity of the newer digital switches to small amounts of voltage requires the telephone company which is upgrading its systems to digital switching systems to also upgrade its central office connection protection systems in order to meet these more stringent protection requirements 
the company supplies central office connection protection systems to meet these needs 
during  approximately of the company s sales were made to customers in this category 
the company s line of signal processing products is supplied to customers in the military and aerospace industry as well as manufacturers of medical equipment and video systems 
the primary communication standard in new military and aerospace systems is the mil std command response data bus  and applications require an extremely high level of reliability and performance 
products are designed to be application specific to satisfy the requirements of each military or aerospace program 
the company s wideband transformers are required for ground noise elimination in video imaging systems and are used in the television and broadcast  medical imaging and industrial process control industries 
if not eliminated  ground noise caused by poor electrical system wiring or power supplies  results in significant deterioration in system performance poor picture quality  process failures in instrumentation  etc the wideband transformers provide a cost effective and quick solution to the problem without the need of redesign of the rest of the system 
during  signal processing equipment accounted for approximately of the company s sales 
marketing and sales the company operates through three business units  which are organized by product line  and with each having responsibility for the sales and marketing of its products 
when appropriate to obtain sales in foreign countries  the company may enter into arrangements and technology transfer agreements covering its products with local manufacturers and participate in manufacturing and licensing arrangements with local telephone equipment suppliers 
in the united states and throughout the world  the company uses independent distributors in the marketing of company products to the customer premises equipment market 
all distributors marketing copper based products also market directly competing products 
in addition  the company continues to promote the direct marketing relationships it forged in the past with telephone operating companies 
in november  the company amended its supply agreement with british telecommunications plc bt for the company s line connecting protecting products 
the amended agreement will expire on august   and provides  among other things  that the company may no longer be the exclusive supplier to bt for these products 
during   and  bt purchased  of sales   of sales  and  of sales  respectively  of the company s line connecting protecting products 
during these years  additional sales of the company s products were also made at the direction of bt to certain unaffiliated suppliers to bt for resale to bt 
the amended contract also provides for a cross license which  in effect  enables bt to use certain of the company s proprietary information to modify or enhance products provided to bt and permits those products to be manufactured by bt or others for its own purposes 
the company s oss systems have primarily been sold to foreign telephone operating companies which are sometimes controlled by foreign governments  and the contracts relating to oss systems are principally negotiated directly between the company and these purchasers 
the signal processing line of products is sold primarily to us military and aerospace prime contractors  and domestic oems and end users 
the following table sets forth for the last three fiscal years the company s sales to customers by geographic region sales to customers by geographic region year ended december  dollars in thousands united states and puerto rico    united kingdom    other europe    asia pacific    latin america    middle east  other total sales    for information regarding the amount of sales  operating profit or loss and identifiable assets attributable to each of the company s geographic areas  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in selling to customers in foreign countries  there are inherent risks not normally present in the case of sales to united states customers  including increased difficulty in identifying and designing systems compatible with purchasers operational requirements  extended delays under oss systems contracts in the completion of testing and purchaser acceptance phases and difficulty in the company s receipt of final payments and political and economic change 
in addition  to the extent that the company establishes facilities in foreign countries  the company faces risks associated with currency devaluation  inability to convert local currency into dollars  local tax regulations and political instability 
manufacturing the company s computer based testing products include the company s proprietary testing circuitry and computer programs  which provide platform independent solutions based on unix or unix compatible operating systems 
the testing products also incorporate disk data storage  data terminals crts  teleprinters  minicomputers and personal computers pc s purchased by the company 
these products are installed and tested by the company on its customers premises 
at present  the company s manufacturing operations are conducted at facilities located in glen cove  new york  matamoros  mexico and seoul  south korea 
the company from time to time also uses subcontractors to augment various aspects of its production activities and periodically explores the feasibility of conducting operations at lower cost manufacturing facilities located abroad 
in pursuing sales opportunities with foreign telephone companies  the company may locate its production activities in foreign countries which require domestic involvement in the production of equipment purchased for their telephone systems and in foreign countries which  in addition  require full or partial technology transfers to domestic enterprises 
in addition  the company had software development sites in syosset  new york  charlotte  north carolina  and coventry  united kingdom 
source and availability of components the company generally purchases the standard components used in the manufacture of its products from a number of suppliers 
the company attempts to assure itself that the components are available from more than one source 
the company purchases the majority of its minicomputers used in its oss systems from digital equipment corporation dec 
however  the company could use other computer equipment in its systems if the company were unable to purchase dec products 
other components  such as crts and teleprinters  used in connecting with the company s electronic products could be obtained from alternate sources and readily integrated with the company s products 
significant customers during the years ended december  and  the company s five largest customers accounted for sales of  or approximately of sales  and  or approximately of sales  respectively 
the company s largest customer is bt 
sales to bt for the year ended december  and amounted to  and  respectively  or approximately and  respectively  of the company s sales for such years 
therefore  any significant interruption or decline in sales to bt may have a materially adverse effect upon the company s operations 
during  sales to the philippines long distance telephone were  or approximately of sales 
no other customers account for or more of the company s sales for either year 
in addition  the former bell operating companies continue to be the ultimate purchasers of a significant portion of the company s products sold in the united states  while sales to foreign telephone operating companies constitute the major portion of the company s foreign sales 
the company s contracts with these customers require no minimum purchases by such customers 
significant customers for the signal processing products include the major us aerospace companies  department of defense service depots and oems in the medical imaging and process control equipment 
both catalog and custom designed products are sold to these customers 
some contracts are multi year procurements 
backlog at december   the company s backlog was  compared with approximately  at december  of the december  backlog  approximately  represented orders from foreign telephone operating companies  including  attributable to the contract with bt 
see marketing and sales 
the company expects to ship substantially all of its december  backlog during however  certain of the company s oss contracts provide for deliveries subsequent to december  patents the company is the owner of a number of utility and design patents and patent applications 
in addition  the company has sought foreign patent protection for a number of its products 
from time to time the company enters into licensing and technical information agreements under which it receives or grants rights to produce certain specified subcomponents used in certain of the company s products or in connection with products developed by the company 
these agreements are for varying terms and provide for the payment or receipt of royalties or technical license fees 
while the company considers patent protection important to the development of its business  and produces certain subcomponents of its products under licensing agreements  the company believes that its success depends primarily upon its engineering  manufacturing and marketing skills 
accordingly  the company does not believe that a denial of any of its pending patent applications  expiration of any of its patents  a determination that any of the patents which have been granted to it are invalid or the cancellation of any of its existing license agreements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
competition the telephone equipment market in which the company does business is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and a movement to private ownership of telecommunications equipment 
in competing for telephone operating company business  the purchase price of equipment and associated operating expenses have become significant factors  along with product design and long standing equipment supply relationships 
in the customer premises equipment market  the company is functioning in a market characterized by distributors and installers of equipment and by commodity pricing 
the company competes directly with a number of large and small telephone equipment manufacturers in the united states  with lucent technologies lucent continuing to be the company s principal united states competitor 
lucent s greater resources  extensive research and development facilities  long standing equipment supply relationships with the operating companies of the regional holding companies and history of manufacturing and marketing products similar in function to those produced by the company continue to be significant factors in the company s competitive environment 
currently  lucent and a number of companies with greater financial resources than the company produce  or have the design and manufacturing capabilities to produce  products competitive with the company s products 
in meeting this competition  the company relies primarily on the performance and design characteristics of its products of comparable performance or design  endeavors to offer its products at prices and with warranties that will make its products competitive 
in connection with overseas sales of its line connecting protecting equipment  the company has met with significant competition from united states and foreign manufacturers of comparable equipment and expects this competition to continue 
in addition to lucent  a number of the company s overseas competitors have significantly greater resources than the company 
the company competes directly with a limited number of substantial domestic and international companies with respect to its sales of oss systems 
in meeting this competition  the company relies primarily on the features of its line testing equipment  its ability to customize systems and endeavors to offer such equipment at prices and with warranties that will make them competitive
