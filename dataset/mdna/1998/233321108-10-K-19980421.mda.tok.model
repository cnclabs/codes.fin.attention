manufacturing operations consist of assembly of printed circuit boards  power supplies  and crates  system integration and final testing 
materials and components used by the company in manufacturing are available primarily from domestic sources 
where possible  the company buys from multiple sources to avoid dependence on any single supplier 
however  certain custom analog devices are only available from a limited number of suppliers 
marketing and sales in the united states  the company primarily sells and services its products through its own sales and service organizations located in michigan and california 
in canada  western europe  korea and japan  the company sells its products through independent distributors through whom the company provides technical and administrative assistance 
for its transportation market products  the company distributes its products through fev in europe except for the united kingdom 
in the united kingdom  the company operates a sales and customer support subsidiary for its powertrain testing products 
the company s standard terms of sale generally require payment within days of shipment 
the following customers accounted for over of fiscal net sales gm at of net sales and hyundai at of net sales 
gm accounted for and of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
no other customer accounted for or more of the company s net sales in fiscal years  or export sales  primarily to the united kingdom  western europe  and the far east  accounted for approximately   and of sales in  and  respectively see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at january  the company had an order backlog of approximately  compared to a backlog of approximately  at january   and approximately  at january  backlog consists of orders believed by management to be firm and scheduled for delivery within twelve months 
however  most orders can be rescheduled or canceled by customers without significant penalty 
in addition  backlog is dependent on the timing of orders  particularly large orders  and on seasonal spending for capital requirements 
accordingly  backlog at january   or at any other date  may not be indicative of prospective sales 
service and warranty the company maintains a telephone hotline staffed with qualified technicians to respond to service calls 
most servicing is performed at its facilities in fremont  california and ann arbor  michigan 
the company generally extends a one year warranty for its products 
warranty costs have been nominal to date 
research and development the company s ability to compete successfully in an industry subject to rapid technological change depends on  among other things  its ability to anticipate and respond to such change 
accordingly  the company is committed to a high level of research and development activity 
the company incurred expenditures for research and development of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal  representing   and  of total sales in each such period 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
which requires the capitalization of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishment of the technological feasibility of producing the finished software product  the company capitalized   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that customers budgets in the automotive and advanced research markets for data acquisition and control products will continue at present levels or that the company will be successful in marketing any new product it develops 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop  manufacture or market additional products as a result of its efforts  that expenditures in addition to those currently anticipated may not be required to complete the research and development or that  if required  financing for these expenditures will be available  that future sales from existing or developed products will be significant  or that any sales will be profitable 
competition competition  from both us and foreign competitors  is strong and active 
some of these competitors are substantially larger companies with greater resources 
management believes that these companies include avl located in graz  austria  and sverdrup  a system integrator based in tennessee 
the company competes primarily on the basis of product diversity  features and functions  price performance  flexibility  and technical support 
in addition  the company believes that an additional competitive factor in the automotive market is its installed base in the united states 
the company believes that it competes favorably with respect to all these factors 
systems integration experience and ability is increasingly a factor in large system orders and the company believes that it has the personnel and the resources to ably compete in this area  although many of its competitors are substantially larger with greater resources 
proprietary rights the company relies upon a combination of copyright  trade secret laws and non disclosure and licensing agreements to establish and maintain its proprietary rights to its products 
the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
although the company continues to implement protective measures and intends to defend its proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
the company believes  however  that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the automated test  measurement and control industries  the legal protections for its products are less significant factors in the company s success than the knowledge  ability  and experience of the company s employees  the frequency of product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of support services provided by the company 
the company is subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
certain technology used in the company s products is licensed from third parties on a non exclusive basis 
these license agreements generally require the company to pay royalties and to fulfill confidentiality obligations in order to maintain the licenses 
the termination of any of these licenses may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of its products or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
employees the company had employees at january  of these employees  worked in manufacturing and engineering  in marketing and sales and in administration 
none of the company s employees is represented by a labor union and there has never been a disruption of operations due to labor dispute

the table and subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
year ended january  net sales cost of sales research and development marketing  general and administrative operating income net income net sales increased by to  in fiscal and by to  in fiscal the increases in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to continued increase in demand for the company s redline data acquisition and control products and custom turnkey services 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales were   and in fiscals  and  respectively 
as anticipated  the increase in cost of sales for fiscal is a result of product mix with lower margin turnkey service related revenues becoming a bigger part of the company s business 
the increase in cost of sales in fiscal primarily reflects the expansion of the service staff to increase the company s capacity to build  install and commission redline products 
these new personnel were brought on board ahead of time to support expected growth in service related revenues 
cost of sales for the company s core products eg  redline adapt  redline acap remain at historical levels 
research and development expenses remained in the million to million range for the three years reported 
as a percentage of net sales  however  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from and in fiscals and  respectively 
the slight increase in fiscal expenses in absolute dollars over the previous year was due to higher development costs associated with the new redline products that were recently introduced at the sae show in detroit  michigan 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal was due primarily to the higher capitalization of software development costs in fiscal which more than offset increased personnel staffing 
marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses increased by to  in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the numbers reflect the company s success this year in using its resources more efficiently 
mg a expenses increased by to  or of sales in from  or of net sales in fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted from additional sales and marketing staff  costs associated with improvements in the company s information technology infrastructure  and higher internal sales commissions due to higher shipments and sales bookings 
net other income in fiscal increased to  after decreasing to  in fiscal from  in fiscal on average  in  the company had greater available cash to invest or to take advantage of vendor early payment discounts this year than in fiscal the lower net other income in fiscal reflects lower available cash invested in interest bearing accounts compared to fiscal the effective tax rates were approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the higher tax rates this year reflect higher domestic income contribution this year compared to last year 
domestic tax rates historically have been higher than the company s foreign subsidiary s tax rates 
the lower tax rates in fiscal reflect the increased profit contributions of the company s uk subsidiary which benefited from a lower tax rate 
other factors that may affect the tax rates include r d tax credits  differences in state tax rates  software capitalization levels and foreign income contributions 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income increased to  or 
per diluted share in fiscal compared to  or 
per diluted share in fiscal and to  or 
per diluted share in fiscal factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following are important factors that should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
new products and rapid technological change 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by continued demands for increasingly sophisticated measurement and control systems and turnkey solutions 
the company s success depends upon its ability to introduce new products and to enhance its existing products with features that meet changing end user requirements 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will gain market acceptance or that the company will be successful in developing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
development and management of systems integration services 
at the beginning of fiscal  management began to expand the services side of our transportation market business 
these services include systems integration  project management  commissioning and installation and  coupled with our redline products  management believes these capabilities will allow us to pursue further our growth in the transportation market by providing full service to our customers 
these services provide us the capability to provide turnkey systems where they are required 
hence  the company has invested in project management  custom manufacturing  system integration  installation and commissioning staff during the past two years 
the company believes that the successful marketing and expansion of its transportation products will be increasingly dependent on its ability to offer these services 
however  the introduction of these services raises several risks for the company 
specifically  the success depends on the time it takes for these personnel and future staff to come up to speed on our products  customers and the services they will provide  ability to compete for qualified personnel in various technical positions  market acceptance of the services  timing of service revenues  and the ability to manage customer projects profitably 
the successful management of these projects depends on the timely availability and quality of key products  the availability of key personnel  the ability to integrate different products from a variety of vendors effectively and the management of difficult scheduling and delivery problems 
most of the company s systems integration projects use fixed price contracts 
the pricing of fixed price contracts requires accurate cost estimation in order to be profitable 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly  depending on a number of factors  some of which could adversely affect the company s operating results and the trading price of the company s common stock 
these factors include timing of receipt of system orders from and shipments to major customers  variation in the company s product mix and component costs  economic conditions prevailing within the company s geographic markets and in the world wide automotive industry  market acceptance of new products and services  the timing and levels of operating expenditures  and exchange rate fluctuations 
any unfavorable change in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
quarterly sales depend in part on the volume and timing of orders received during a quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
moreover  a disproportionate percentage of the company s net sales in any quarter are typically generated in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  a shortfall in net sales in any quarter as compared to expectations may not be identifiable until the end of the quarter 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from a few customers 
hence  a decrease in the purchasing levels from one or more of these customers could adversely impact operating results 
dependence on international sales 
part of the company s revenue growth in the past few years was due to increases in the company s international sales  particularly in western europe and asia 
international sales accounted for approximately   and of net sales in fiscals  and the company s international sales are subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including political and economic changes and disruptions  various regulatory requirements  and tariffs or other barriers 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates may render the company s products less competitive relative to local product offerings or may cause foreign customers to delay or decrease potential orders 
one or more of these factors may have a material effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s operating results 
competition 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
some of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  manufacturing or marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some of these competitors have a larger installed base than the company  particularly outside the united states 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on a number of factors  including price  product functionality  product quality and reliability  system integration capabilities  and post sale service and support 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors 
competitors could introduce additional products or add features to their existing products that are superior to the company s products or that achieve greater market acceptance 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to  at january  from  at january   while the current ratio decreased to to from to in fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased to  from  due primarily to a  increase in operating activities and lower capital expenditure levels 
at january   the company had a  secured bank line of credit 
cash flows generated from operations in fiscal include  received from customers as deposits on future orders  the revenues of which will be recognized in future periods 
as such  cash flows from operations will be proportionately reduced in these periods 
the company s management believes that cash and cash equivalents  funds from operations and funds available under its bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated requirements in at january   the company had no material outstanding commitments to purchase capital equipment 
year compliance the company believes that its products are year compliant 
the company is currently reviewing its internal management information systems  billing  outside payroll and other informational service functions to determine the nature and extent of any year issues related to such functions 
in addition  year issues may also arise with respect to products furnished by third party suppliers that may result in unforseen costs or delays to the company and therefore may have a material adverse effect on the company
