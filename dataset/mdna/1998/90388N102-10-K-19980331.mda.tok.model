while the company believes that demand for the product is strong  any failure of the company to successfully implement this product in its customer base could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the high volume of system sales in and and the introduction and demand for the company s new client server applications across its customer base exceeded the capacity of the company s training  installation  and customer support organization in the last two quarters of and in in addition  the company s customers expressed strong demand for the new information management applications  causing the company to release certain products before implementation of an effective product field testing process 
customer difficulties occurred as certain product errors and failures were encountered and as customers became aware of certain perceived functionality issues 
as a result  broad market acceptance did not occur  and the company made certain economic accommodations to resolve the product issues 
these difficulties resulted in an increase in the company s unbilled revenues  a significant increase in the company s reserve for doubtful accounts and sales returns and contributed to significant decreases in new customers and software sales during the last two quarters of and continuing through the company has made substantial management and operational changes in and now feels that it has significantly improved its products  operations  and position with its customers 
software products as complex as those offered by the company often contain undetected errors or failures  or contain new functionality that may not meet customer expectations 
nevertheless  through the company had no history of product returns or significant customer credits or other customer economic accommodations 
however  during and  the company experienced customer difficulties in two areas  the introduction of certain new client server products and installation delays on several new customer installations 
the company feels that it has made significant improvements in many areas to address these issues 
however  any failure to develop and deliver new products or delays in the installation process inherent in products and services as complex as those offered by the company could cause a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations revenues the company s revenues are comprised of software license fees  customer maintenance  services and other revenues and hardware revenues 
total revenues were million in fiscal  compared to million in and million in revenues in the company s core business  excluding hardware sales  were million in compared to million in and million in software revenues were million in  compared to million in  and million in this decline was associated with the high volume of system sales in and and the emphasis the company placed on its new client server applications for which demand outpaced the company s ability to perform and which resulted in lower system sales 
this decline was partially offset by re licensing fees on the company s software 
the company s maintenance revenues are derived from quarterly  annual  and multi year support agreements with its customers 
maintenance revenue increased in to million  up from million in and million in the increases in and were primarily a result of growth in new ultrafis system customer installations and the volume of new information management application modules introduced and installed during and services and other revenues include training and installation  custom development  service bureau operation fees and disaster recovery contracts 
services and other revenues were million in  compared to million in and million in the decline in was primarily attributable to the decline in new system sales and the sale of the company s own service bureau business to psi 
the increase in was primarily attributable to new system sales and installations 
hardware revenues decreased in to million  compared to million in and million in the hardware revenue decrease in is primarily attributable to the decrease in new system sales compared to and additionally  hardware revenues depend on the mix of customer orders and the timing of particular customer installations which fluctuate substantially from year to year 
in the fourth quarter of the company entered into a relationship with esi to configure  sell  distribute  and provide service for the company s hp and ibm hardware products and operating systems 
the company expects a significant decrease in its direct hardware revenues in due to its newly formed relationship with esi 
gross margins gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased to in  up from in and down from in the primary cause of the increase in from was the mix of revenues in the company s core business  which includes software  maintenance  and services and other  which increased to of total revenues in compared to less than in additionally  the margin improvement in was attributable to the company s increase in maintenance revenues and improvements in services and other resulting in approximately a  gross margin in compared to approximately a  negative gross margin in the primary cause of the decline in from was that installations and training for new system conversions  a large component of the services and other segments  operated at a loss for due to cost overruns on committed contracts and associated travel expenses 
software gross margin as a percentage of software revenue increased eight percentage points in to up from in and in software margins fluctuate based on the mix of sales of the company s software and third party software which is sold at lower margins 
the increase in margins in was due to a reduction in new system sales which requires a third party database 
additionally  there were fewer upgrades of the legacy database to the current database as a majority of the company s customers had already upgraded their database prior to the decrease in from was due to a higher proportion of sales of software purchased and licensed from third parties 
maintenance gross margin as a percentage of maintenance revenues was approximately the same in and at and down from in the decrease from was primarily due to expanded product lines and an increase in the customer base requiring additional resources 
services and other revenues gross margin as a percentage of services and other revenues increased to in from a loss in and down from in the margins in were negatively impacted by costs for travel and direct expenses on contracts higher than those contracted for by the company s customers 
hardware gross margin as a percentage of hardware revenues decreased slightly during to compared to in and up from in hardware margins fluctuate depending on the mix of high end host system sales versus lower end client server hardware 
sales discounts offered to customers also impact hardware margins 
operating expenses product development expenses decreased to million in down from million in and up from million in product development expenses as a percent of total revenue increased to in compared to in and in the decrease in total dollar spending in compared to was primarily the result of a reallocation of resources to focus the company on client server product lines  product standardization and customer support  the reduction of the number of consultants used in product development  and a reduction in other product development overhead expenses 
the increase in total dollar spending in compared to was primarily due to an increase in staffing and contract programmers to develope new client server applications and regulatory compliance 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and increased from million in the decrease in from was primarily attributable to significant cost reductions in overhead expenses in  including consolidating its headquarters from two facilities to one in the first quarter on as well as other general cost reductions 
additionally  the company made significant reductions in staffing levels to support lower new account sales volumes in interest income expense  net interest income net of interest expense decreased to  in compared to net interest income of  in and interest expense of  in the increase of interest income net of interest expense was due primarily to higher earnings in from the investment of the funds generated by the company s initial public offering 
certain factors affecting future operating results the company s future operating results will depend upon conditions in its market that may affect demand for its products and its ability to enhance its existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
the company must also manage growth and change effectively as failure to do so could materially and adversely affect its business and operating results 
in connection with the audit of the company s financial statements  the company s independent accountants identified certain reportable conditions relating to material weaknesses in the company s internal controls 
with respect to the company s process for new product releases  the company s independent accountants noted material weaknesses in its field testing procedures and customer communication  resulting in installation delays and aging of receivables and unbilled revenues and the shipment of products in advance of the company s capacity to install on a timely basis resulting in a significant increase in unbilled revenues 
material weaknesses were also identified in the company s procedures for timely analyzing customer balances  estimating the overall cost of training and installation obligations and the cost to complete at any particular time 
these material weaknesses were exacerbated by inefficiencies in the company s accounting system 
as a result of these material weaknesses in the company s accounting system  the auditors expressed significant concerns about the company s ability to report timely  accurate financial information in the future 
the company believes it has made a significant progress addressing many of these issues  especially with respect to its product release cycle and installation procedures 
however  there can be no assurance the company will resolve all of these issues in a timely manner 
installation of the company s ultrafis system is a complex process that must typically be done without any disruption of the customer s services 
failure by the company to successfully install an ultrafis system could result in significant loss of revenue in a particular quarter and fluctuation in the company s results of operations 
although the company schedules the installations of its products several months in advance  its ability to achieve its revenue plans  both in the near term and in the long term  depends on the company s continued ability to sign new customer contracts and to complete such contracts on schedule 
failure to close new customer contracts as a result of lost sales or deferrals of customer decisions could have a material adverse impact on the future operating results 
there can be no assurance that sales or installations will continue to occur at historical rates or in accordance with the company s expectations 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of specific revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company has previously experienced delays in the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  including certain of its client server products 
the length of these delays has varied depending upon the size and scope of the project and the nature of the problems encountered 
any significant delay in the development of new products  or the failure of these new products  if and when installed  to achieve a significant degree of market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  and may do so in the future 
operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for the company s products  the introduction and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in the levels of operating expenses  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  competitive conditions in the credit union and financial services markets and economic conditions generally or in various industry segments 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s business has been derived from substantial contracts with large organizations with long decision making cycles  and the timing of such orders has caused material fluctuations in the company s operating results 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future revenues and in the short term are fixed to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  if anticipated revenues do not occur or are delayed  the company s operating results would be disproportionately affected 
the company expects quarterly and annual fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  software products as complex as those offered by the company often contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments 
the occurrence of such errors could result in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of the company s revenues historically have been related to the company s ultrafis system  and the company expects that a substantial portion of its future revenues will be generated by the integration of its ultrafis system with its client server products 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to sell  install  maintain and enhance the ultrafis system and client server products and to develop  on a timely and cost effective basis utilizing new technologies  application modules that meet evolving customer needs 
the company has recently discontinued its alps standalone product and client server products for third party platforms 
any failure by the company to anticipate or to respond adequately to new and changing market conditions  enhance the ultrafis system and client server products  develop application modules  compete with new product offerings by third parties  complete new standalone product offerings  respond to emerging industry standards  adapt to changing technologies  maintain sales of the company s products  or continue to sign and complete new customer contracts would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
statement of position sop software revenue recognition  which was issued october   supersedes sop and is effective for transactions entered into for fiscal years beginning after december  sop addresses revenue recognition from a conceptual level and does not specifically address implementation guidance 
the company believes  based on its reading and interpretation of sop  that this statement may result in a deferral of revenue recognition  but the company feels that any impact of this statement will be reduced by its current software backlog and by anticipated changes to its business practices relative to its direct sale and service of hardware through the company s recently formed relationship with esi 
sop is a complex issue that must be integrated into the company s current and future business practices 
the final implementation of this statement may differ from the company s current interpretation with respect to the impact of future earnings 
on february   the united states supreme court affirmed a ruling by a united states district court providing that federal credit unions may not extend membership benefits to individuals who are not part of the credit union s original charter group 
this ruling imposes limits on new customers that a federal credit union may attract 
as a result  some federal credit unions have expressed a reluctance to pursue extensive capital purchases until the impact of the ruling is further assessed 
while federal credit unions represent approximately of all credit unions  less than half of these credit unions are affected by this ruling 
the interpretation of this ruling could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
since this supreme court ruling  there has been significant congressional legislative activity 
the company is monitoring this activity to determine the impact on its current and future business 
year disclosure many software computer programs in the industry rely on an internal date format using two digit data programs to perform computation and decision making functions that may cause computer systems generally to malfunction with respect to dates beginning with the year the company uses an internal date format that has never relied on two digit data programs and that was upgraded and made available to the company s customers in august the company believes that date entry will not be a material issue either with the company s core transaction processing engine or the company s own information management applications 
the company is currently evaluating year compliance issues with third party hardware and software products and support providers 
the company has determined that some of the third party products it markets or which are used within its products are not year compliant 
the company is working with such third party product providers to identify courses of action that may lead to third party product compliance 
in addition  the company has communicated the status of these compliance issues to its customers and is working on making alternatives available to its customers as appropriate 
because the company s customers depend on some of the products from these third party providers  both the company and its customers may be adversely impacted depending upon the ability of such third party providers to comply with year requirements 
as a result of changes made by third parties in their products to make them year compliant  the company is modifying certain of its software that interfaces with  and is continuing to test its software to demonstrate interoperability with  such third party products 
the company does not expect that it will incur material net expenses as a result of such efforts 
as required by the national credit union administration ncua  the company s customers must ensure their computer systems are year compliant 
the company is currently providing  and expects to continue providing  systems testing  training and other assistance to its customers to help them achieve such compliance 
the costs to the company of providing such systems testing  training and assistance are not expected to be material 
the assessment of the company s year remediation costs and timing is based on the company s estimates derived from numerous assumptions of future events  including  among others  the continued availability of certain resources to help its customers attain year compliance as well as the ability of third party product providers to comply with year requirements 
factors that could affect these estimates include  among other items  the cost and availability of personnel with the ability to modify relevant computer codes and to address other issues relating to the year there can be no assurance that the company s estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
to the extent that these estimates differ from actual results  the year issue could have a material impact on the business operations and financial condition of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s management believes current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and expected cash generated from operations will satisfy its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
in september  the company entered into an agreement with a bank to obtain a million revolving line of credit  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate  and a million capital equipment facility bearing interest at prime plus 
the company was in violation of certain financial covenants under this agreement as of december  in may  the bank waived these violations  and the company and the bank restructured their relationship replacing the revolving line of credit with a factoring agreement 
the factoring agreement provides for borrowing by the company of up to million  to be effected by the bank s purchase of eligible accounts receivable and payment to the company of an amount equal to of the purchased accounts receivable 
purchases of receivables and corresponding advances to the company are at the discretion of the bank 
there is a administrative fee for each receivable purchased and a monthly finance charge for as long as each purchased receivable remains outstanding 
the factoring agreement renews  unless terminated by the company or the bank  in april the agreement also provides that the borrowings under the factoring agreement and capital equipment facility are secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the company 
as of december  and  the outstanding balance on the capital equipment facility was  and  respectively 
as part of the new agreement  no further draws will be available and the company established cash collateral for the capital equipment facility balance 
the company is paying off this balance and reducing the cash collateral in monthly installments of  capital expenditures of million in were primarily for furniture and fixtures for the company s new headquarters facility and purchased software 
net cash used for operations was million for the year ending december  for the year ending december   net cash used for operations was million 
unbilled revenue decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  trade accounts receivable also decreased to million at december  compared to million in these declines in billed and unbilled receivables are partially attributable to the decline in revenues and to the improvement in the company s product release cycle and installation procedures throughout
