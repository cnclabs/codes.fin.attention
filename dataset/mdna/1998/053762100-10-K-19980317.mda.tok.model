the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through private placements of preferred stock from to  an initial public offering of its common stock in november  a private sale of common stock in march  and a second public offering of common stock in august through december   the company had raised approximately million from such sales net of offering expenses

the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with the interest thereon  and revenues from existing collaborations  will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations through the company s future cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including continued scientific progress in the research and development of the company s technology and vaccine programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the cost of constructing manufacturing facilities  should they be deemed necessary  and product commercialization activities 
in particular  if the company were to construct and equip such a manufacturing facility during this period  the company anticipates that it would likely begin to make substantial additional capital expenditures in the second half of and beyond  which may require the company to seek additional funding

there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborative agreements with others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself  which would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
