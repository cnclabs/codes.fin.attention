year ended december  versus year ended september  daniel s consolidated revenues increased during the year ended december  when compared to the fiscal year ended september  the increase is due to a increase in net revenues from the sale of valve actuators and controls and a increase from the sale of flow measurement and control products and services 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by decreased revenues attributable to the absence of large orders for slab gate valves which contributed to the valve operation s strong performance in fiscal the gross margin percentage in was  up slightly from in fiscal the gross margin in was favorably affected by increased margins on the sale of flow measurement and control products  while the margins on the sale of valves and valve actuators were relatively flat from year to year 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses in were up when compared to fiscal and increased as a percentage of sales from to 
this increase was due largely to the expenses of companies acquired in being included for the full year 
research and development expenses increased from  to  primarily due to the may acquisition of spectra tek international limited  coupled with increased spending on electronic product development 
during  the company sold certain non core assets  a building owned by a subsidiary of bettis and the stock in a german subsidiary with no significant gain or loss recognized 
certain of these assets had been written down in prior periods 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was substantially unchanged at compared to for the fiscal year ended september  three months ended december  vs 
three months ended december  the company recorded pretax charges in the three months ended december  of  resulting in a net loss of  for the period compared to net income of  for the same period in unusual charges recorded in the period consist of the following in thousands downsizing of a german subsidiary  expenses incurred in connection with the bettis merger  re organization costs  largely severance  write downs of long lived assets  losses arising from the sales of product lines  total  the unusual charges were a result of the company s ongoing strategic evaluation 
the downsizing of the german operations resulted in charges for asset impairments  inventory valuation adjustments and severance accruals 
although not a part of the above total of unusual charges  the evaluations above resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance of approximately  relative to the utilization of the german net operating loss carryforward 
in addition to the german downsizing  during the period the company committed to disposing of certain insignificant  non strategic product lines  determined that certain long lived assets were impaired  and provided accruals for the severance costs of certain employees 
revenues for the three months ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in revenues from businesses acquired by both daniel and bettis in of  were more than offset by a decline in revenues from sales of valve products due to the timing of orders and by the inclusion in the prior year of revenues aggregating  from divested operations 
the gross margin for the three months ended december  declined to of revenues compared to in the prior period 
the decline was due primarily to a change in the product mix of actuators sold and  to a lessor extent the decrease in sales of valve products 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses increased by  to  in the period due primarily to expenses of companies acquired in research and development expenses increased by  representing increased expenditures on certain electronic development projects 
in the three months ended december   the company sold a non manufacturing property in germany resulting in a pretax gain of  interest expense increased  due primarily to increased borrowings which were used to fund acquisitions by both daniel and bettis in the effective tax rate in the period is different from the us statutory rate due primarily to losses of the german operations for which no tax benefits were recognized and the non deductibility of certain expenses associated with the bettis merger 
year ended september  versus year ended september  consolidated revenues increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the revenues from divested operations of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  revenues increased  from the prior year  as a result of increased sales of large diameter gate valves and valve actuators and controls 
the gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to in discounting the effect of divested operations in both periods and an inventory write down charge recorded in fiscal  there was a slight deterioration in margins 
this decrease was due to a change in product mix towards sales of valve products  which historically have earned lower margins than daniel s other products 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses were down to  in fiscal when compared to the improvement in these expenses as a percentage of revenues was the result of revenues increasing at a higher rate than expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to  in fiscal primarily due to completion of certain electronics projects 
the effective tax rate in fiscal of approximately was higher than the us statutory rate largely due to losses in germany  for which no tax benefits were recognized 
in fiscal  the company realized a tax benefit of due to the losses recognized on the restructuring and other charges and divestiture of assets 
in fiscal  daniel sold certain non manufacturing properties in germany and a non core product line resulting in pretax gains of  and  in fiscal  recorded pretax losses aggregating  relating to the divestitures of non core assets 
impact of inflation an effect of inflation is to increase the prices of labor and raw materials used to manufacture daniel s products  which may require periodic increases in the prices for the products to maintain gross profit margins 
management does not consider daniel to have any unique difficulty in managing the effects of inflation on its business 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of daniel s liquidity during the year ended december  were internally generated funds  cash available at the beginning of the year  borrowings and the proceeds from the divestitures of assets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these funds were used primarily for capital expenditures  payments of dividends and payments on long term and short term debt 
at december   working capital increased by  to  primarily due to an increase in receivables resulting from increased sales volume in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  a decrease in short term notes payable resulting from the refinancing of certain notes outstanding as of december  also contributed to the increase in working capital from december  to december  daniel considers its financial position to be strong with a current ratio of to working capital at december  included  in inventories and deferred tax assets  which are not as liquid as other current assets 
in november  daniel entered into a credit agreement with a group of four banks  which provided for a  term loan and a  revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to refinance the l  approximately  note originally utilized in the acquisition of spectra tek in may  as well as bettis term loan and a portion of bettis revolving loan 
borrowings of  under the revolving credit facility were used to refinance the balance of bettis revolving loan 
the remainder of the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the issuance of letters of credit

the margin is adjusted no later than days after the end of each quarter and days after the end of each fiscal year 
interest is due on the last day of each calendar quarter for base rate loans and at the end of one  two or three months for libor loans depending on the interest period selected which also includes a six month option 
at december   the interest rate on the revolving credit facility loans was 
by entering into a swap agreement  daniel effectively fixed the rate of interest for the life of the term loan at plus the margin described above 
at december   the interest rate on the term loan was 
daniel also pays a quarterly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility plus a fee of for letters of credit 
the loans under the credit agreement are unsecured with a negative pledge on daniel s assets and are guaranteed by daniel s material domestic subsidiaries

the company believes that its working capital  cash generated from operations and amounts available under its lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its operating needs for the foreseeable future 
year the year issue is the inability of computers and computing technology to recognize correctly the change in date from to the problem results from a long standing practice by programmers to save memory space by denoting years using two digits instead of four 
systems that are not year compliant may be unable to read dates correctly after the year and may return incorrect or unpredictable results 
this could have a significant effect on the company s business financial systems as well as products and services if not corrected 
daniel recognizes that the year issue creates a significant uncertainty to its business and that year compliance to safeguard operations and minimize business disruption is a key business obligation 
a program is underway in the company to ensure that critical business systems  products and services both in the united states and internationally are year compliant 
the company is also working with suppliers and customers with regard to year compliance 
the focus in will be on completing the detailed assessment of the extent of remedial action required and the design of solutions 
the main focus in will be on testing and implementation of revised programs  products and services 
the assessment of existing products and services is incomplete and the company cannot as yet make a final conclusion as to whether all products and services will be year compliant 
the company does believe  based on the assessments completed to date  that the critical year problems can be corrected 
the company has not completed an estimate of the cost of addressing this issue but does not believe that the costs will be material 
costs incurred in connection with year compliance will be treated as period costs and expensed as incurred
