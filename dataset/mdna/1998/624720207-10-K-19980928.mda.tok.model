the company expects gross profit percentages related to thompson products will increase as the company continues to improve the thompson manufacturing processes after the acquisition 
increasing gross profit percentages in the precision abrasives segment were attributable to continued efficiencies gained in the manufacturing process and a shift in the product mix to the company s higher gross profit products

net cash of  was used in operations for the year ended june  net cash of  and  was provided by operations for the years ended june  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash flows used in operations increased due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable caused by an extension of credit terms to an increasing foreign customer base  an increase in inventory levels to reduce order fulfillment time and payments related to the settlement of the foot powder matter 
the decreasing cash flows from operations between fiscal and fiscal were a result of the net loss experienced  as well as the timing of collections from the company s larger customers

the company believes that inflation has not  and will not  have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements and requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted for the company s fiscal year ending june  the adoption of this pronouncement is expected to have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted for the company s fiscal financial statements 
the adoption of this pronouncement should not have any impact on the company s existing disclosures 
risks associated with the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions and information  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company does not believe that it has material exposure to the year issue with respect to its own information systems since the company has reviewed its existing systems and they either correctly define the year or are expected to be replaced before year issues will arise 
non information technology systems that utilize embedded technology  such as microcontrollers  may also face year issues 
however  the company believes that it does not have significant year issues related to non information technology systems and is currently reviewing these systems 
this review is expected to be completed during fiscal in addition  the company is conducting an analysis to determine the extent to which its major vendors systems insofar as they relate to the company s business are subject to the year issue 
this review is expected to be completed during fiscal the company is currently unable to predict the extent to which it would be vulnerable to its vendors failure to remediate any year issues on a timely basis 
the failure of a major vendor subject to the year issue to convert its systems on a timely basis or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company also faces potential loss of revenue from customers who may have year issues 
currently  the company is unable to predict how and to what extent its operations may be effected by year issues at its customers  however  year issues at a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
to date the company has not made any contingency plans to address third party year risks 
the company plans to formulate contingency plans to the extent necessary in fiscal historical and estimated costs directly related to year issue remediation at the company have been and are expected to be immaterial as the company s systems have been and will be upgraded on a normal replacement schedule with only immaterial opportunity costs of moyco personnel to ensure new systems and third parties are year compliant

changes in the us dental health care system 
there has been substantial debate in the political arena related to prospective changes in the us health care system 
in addition  developments in both the public and the private sector may significantly affect the financing and delivery of dental health care in the united states  including the expansion of managed care programs  large dental practices  franchises  purchasing groups  and industry consolidation 
cost containment has been a major element of these developments 
there can be no assurance that such changes in the financing and delivery of dental health care will not continue to affect dental capital equipment and supplies procurement patterns or dictate which procedures will be covered by applicable insurance or government funded or subsidized programs 
the company also cannot predict the extent or impact of future legislation or regulations 
competition 
the company faces substantial competition from other manufacturers 
competitive pressure could result in price competition or the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  which could have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the company is engaged in industries characterized by extensive research efforts 
advances in products and other discoveries or developments could render some of the company s products obsolete 
some of the companies with which the company competes or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater financial  technical and personnel resources than the company and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in evolving industries 
governmental regulation 
government regulation in the us and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacturing and marketing of many of the company s products and in the company s ongoing research and development activities 
specifically  dental devices are subject to united states food and drug administration fda approval or clearance before they can be utilized for clinical studies or sold commercially 
the process for obtaining the necessary approvals and compliance with applicable regulations can be costly and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that regulatory review will not involve delays or other actions adversely affecting the marketing and sales of the company s products 
there is no assurance the company will continue to be able to obtain required government approvals or successfully comply with such regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and failure to do so may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
further  there can be no assurances that more stringent regulatory requirements and or safety and quality standards will not be issued in the future with an adverse effect on the company s business 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable regulations of the fda  current regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the company s products are similarly subject to foreign regulating bodies 
typically  foreign bodies readily allow the company s products to be traded within their jurisdictions  based on the fact that the company s products are regulated by the fda 
however  there can be no assurance that such foreign bodies will not impose different  additional requirements that may materially hamper the company s ability to compete in overseas markets 
the company has received ce conformite european certification for its major dental product lines for european distribution and is constantly evaluating regulatory requirements in various territories throughout the world to ensure compliance with same 
patents and proprietary technologies 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
the company owns united states patents  japanese patent and a number of issued foreign patents and pending patent applications for its products 
the company plans to continue to patent inventions which may provide commercial benefit 
currently  the company has one patent application pending for a new endodontic instrument design 
in addition  the company is reviewing the possibility of filing several new applications related to both its dental and abrasives technologies 
the company treats its design and technical data as confidential  and relies on nondisclosure safeguards  such as confidentiality agreements  laws protecting trade secrets and agreements to protect proprietary information 
the company has incurred substantial costs in enforcing its patents against infringement by others and defending itself against similar claims of others 
although the company has been successful to date in disputes involving the validity and enforceability of its patents and in defending itself against claims by others of patent infringement  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in such matters in the future or that the company s patents or other proprietary rights  even if continuing to be held valid  will be broad enough in scope to enable the company to prevent third parties from producing products using similar technologies or processes 
with regard to the current dentsply litigation  the company remains confident that its intellectual property position is strong 
for more information  see legal proceedings in part i  item of this from k 
product development 
the company is actively engaged in identifying market needs and in developing products to satisfy those unmet needs 
such products are not necessarily in the company s current business segments 
the company attempts to validate the existence of such unmet needs as well as the potential revenues  costs and profits involved in satisfying such needs 
there is a material risk that the company s competitors may satisfy those needs with more effective or less expensive products 
there is also a material risk that the company s estimates of the economic potential from such unmet needs may be incomplete or inaccurate  or that the products which the company develops to meet such needs will be untimely introduced or insufficiently effective clinically or economically to gain market acceptance 
change in marketing approach 
with regard to the dental supplies segment  the company plans to fund and or sponsor various educational programs including  but not limited to seminars  lectures and demonstrations by industry opinion leaders 
while trade shows  dealer product presentations  advertising and other traditional marketing strategies will continue  the company will shift its marketing emphasis to professional endorsement of products 
the company believes that this method of marketing will create greater demand for technique sensitive products 
with regard to the precision abrasives segment  the company plans to focus on higher margin products 
although the company believes that this transition will have a long term positive financial impact  no assurance can be given that the actions taken will provide the intended results  or that the company will not experience short term disruptions or an adverse impact of operations during the transition to this new marketing approach
