overview the company has centered its operations around the blimpie subs salads chain of quick service restaurants 
the company and its subfranchisors have doubled the number of operating restaurants over the past three years  increasing from restaurants at june  to  restaurants at june  continuing fees based upon each franchisee s gross sales have increased in the same time period  increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company achieved record profitability by generating over million in net income and per diluted share 
despite the continued increases in the number of restaurants and in continuing fees  the company s profitability declined in both fiscal and due  in each case  primarily to a decrease in revenues from the sale of subfranchise territories 
generally  the company pays its subfranchisors approximately half of the continuing fees and franchise fees it receives  and has a high cost of equipment sales 
sales of subfranchises and master licenses are the most profitable sales for the company  since only a portion of such sales must be paid in the form of a trademark license fee which is approximately of the related revenues 
during fiscal  the company recognized over million in subfranchise and master license fees  but this amount declined to million in fiscal and to just under million in fiscal since most of the available domestic subfranchise territories have been sold  the company began focusing on the international market beginning in fiscal sales of master license territories were strong in fiscal  but decreased in fiscal as the company focused on assisting its existing master licensors in developing their territories 
while the company believes that the international marketplace represents a vast potential for growth  there are many barriers to success in this arena  and no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in its attempt to develop outside of the united states 
faced with declining profitability despite the consistent growth in the number of blimpie outlets and continuing fees  the company began to develop several new initiatives  the most notable of which was the introduction of three new brands 
during fiscal  the company restructured its management personnel in order to provide better support to its subfranchisors and franchisees in the blimpie subs salads group  as well as to allow others to focus on building new franchise opportunities 
the company believes that it can continue to improve its blimpie subs salads operations while using its franchising expertise to introduce new franchise concepts that complement the blimpie brand 
the development of new franchise concepts is an expensive endeavor  and the company has incurred additional expenses in fiscal relating to these efforts  and will continue to incur similar costs in fiscal and beyond 
the three new franchise concepts are maui tacos tm  pasta central tm  and smoothie island tm 
the first locations for maui tacos and pasta central are under construction as of september   and are expected to be operational prior to december  the first maui tacos subfranchise territory was sold in july the first two smoothie island locations opened in early september within existing blimpie subs salads locations in tallahassee  fl and denver  co 
the company believes that these new concepts will be well received and that the blimpie brand will continue to be successful 
looking forward  the company anticipates that fiscal will include many changes in its operations 
the company will operate the first maui tacos store  and expects to generate store sales and store costs associated with the operation of this store 
in addition  all three new concepts are expected to generate new revenues in fiscal  and to continue to increase selling  general and administrative expenses through additional personnel  legal and advertising costs necessary to support these initiatives 
no assurance can be given that the introduction of these concepts will result in increased revenues  or that such revenues  if received  will exceed the related costs 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  the company s net income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the company s basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal such decreases are attributable primarily to decreases in subfranchise  master license and franchise fees  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are discussed below 
the company s continuing fees derived from franchises increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was due to the increase in the number of open outlets from  at june  to  at june  continuing fees increased at a slower rate than the rate of outlet openings primarily because a greater percentage of the new outlets were new concept outlets which have lower average unit volumes than traditional outlets 
new concept outlets include those located in convenience stores  institutional food service facilities  colleges  schools  mass feeders  hospitals  bowling alleys  golf courses and subway stations 
subfranchisor fees  master license fees and fees from the sales and resales of franchises decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the following table summarizes the components of these fees for fiscal and year ended june  amounts in s change subfranchisor fees master license fees  franchise and resale fees   total   subfranchise fees decreased due to fewer expansions of existing territories and lower deferred subfranchise fees recognized in fiscal compared to fiscal master license fees decreased from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  the company granted development rights for international territories  including countries and the canadian province of ontario 
in fiscal  the company granted development rights for four international territories  including panama  portugal  puerto rico and the canadian province of manitoba 
this reduction in the number of master licenses sold was due to a shift in focus from selling new territories to helping existing master licensors to develop their respective territories 
revenues from sales of franchises and resale fees decreased in fiscal due primarily to a greater percentage of the new outlets being new concept outlets  which generally have a lower franchise fee per outlet 
the number of new outlets opened increased to new outlets in fiscal from in fiscal as of june   the company had master licensors operating in countries  and blimpie outlets operating in of these countries 
the company s focus in will be to continue to sell new international territories while assisting our master licensors with the aggressive development of the existing areas 
although the company has strengthened its infrastructure and created an international department to support international expansion  the international market has not developed as rapidly as expected with regard to master license fees and outlet openings 
no assurances can be given that the company s investment in the international marketplace will increase either franchise grants  master license fees or outlet openings  or if such increases do occur  that they will result in material increments in revenue 
store equipment sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this slight decrease was due to a greater percentage of the new franchises being new concept franchises  which typically purchase less equipment than traditional locations 
the decrease in sales to blimpie franchises was partially offset by an increase in sales to non affiliates 
in fiscal  the company expanded its equipment sales department in houston in order to sell equipment to franchisees of other chains 
for that year  such activities accounted for of total equipment sales 
the company believes this expansion will continue to increase revenue and in turn net income  however no assurances can be given that this expansion will generate any additional revenue or net income 
management fees and other income for the year ended june  decreased to  from  in fiscal this decrease resulted from the january relocation of one of the company s subfranchisors who had previously been sharing office space in the atlanta office  and paying fees to the company in connection therewith 
the subfranchisors shares of continuing and franchise fees increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the most significant portion of this expense is the subfranchisor s share of continuing fees  which generally is of the fees collected by the company 
the overall increase in this expense was due primarily to the increase in continuing fees 
another component of this expense is the subfranchisor s share of franchise and resale fees 
this share generally amounts to between and of the franchise fee for new franchises and between and of the resale fees collected 
due to the overall decrease in franchise and resale fees  this portion of the total expense decreased in fiscal from fiscal the final component of this expense is the trademark license fee paid to mbi 
see business trademarks  trade names  service marks and logos  know how and methods of operation 
mbi receives a fee on revenues earned in all international markets and certain domestic markets  which consisted of all or a portion of states in which the company had open franchises as of june  generally  the fee earned by mbi is of the amount received by the company  net of direct costs  including amounts paid to subfranchisors and master licensors and the cost of equipment 
the trademark license fees earned by mbi decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to the decrease in master license and subfranchise fees 
in fiscal  a trademark license fee totaling  also was paid to anthony p 
conza  the chairman and chief executive officer of the company  and david l 
siegel  the vice chairman and chief operating officer of the company  amounting to of all international revenues  net of direct expenses 
this trademark license fee was discontinued in february  when the company acquired the international trademark rights owned by these individuals 
store equipment cost of sales decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was due to the decrease in store equipment sales  combined with an improvement in the profit margin on the sales 
the gross margin on store equipment sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a small price increase in fiscal and a favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expense rose to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to additional personnel and related costs associated with the growth in number of blimpie outlets  as well as personnel  legal and other costs incurred in the development of the maui tacos  smoothie island and pasta central brands 
management believes that the number of blimpie outlets will continue to increase and the new brands will continue to require increased support as franchises and or subfranchise territories are sold 
therefore  management expects selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for at least the next year 
interest income in fiscal decreased by to  from  in fiscal this decrease was the result of the selling of a portion of the us treasury notes owned by the company to purchase a portion of the international trademarks and service marks in february see business trademarks  trade names  service marks and logos  know how and methods of operation 
the effective income tax rates income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income were in fiscal and in fiscal the slight decrease was due to a lower effective state tax rate 
fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  results of operations the company s net income decreased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  the company s primary earnings per share decreased to 
per share for the twelve months ended june  from 
per share for the twelve months ended june   while during the same periods  the company s fully diluted earnings per share decreased to 
per share from 
per share 
such decreases are attributable to the decreases in subfranchise and franchise fees  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are discussed below 
the company s continuing fees derived from domestic franchises increased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  continuing fees derived from international franchises increased during the twelve months ended june  to  from  during comparable period of fiscal these increases are directly attributable to the greater number of total open outlets as compared to the same periods ended in fiscal during the twelve month period ended june   the company experienced decreases in revenue from total subfranchise fees and franchise fees recognized 
the company believes that such decreases are the result of the saturation of the domestic market with subfranchisors and the maturing of the convenience store segment of the new concept marketplace 
with that in mind the company has refocused on traditional outlet development by increasing franchise advertising  and hiring more sales staff 
the company believes its refocusing on traditional outlet development will increase both franchise grants and outlet openings in the future 
in addition  the company will continue to place greater emphasis on developing the international market to mirror the success it has achieved in the united states 
although the company has strengthened its infrastructure and created an international department to support international expansion  the international market has not developed as rapidly as expected with regard to master license fees and outlet openings 
no assurances can be given that the above mentioned refocusing by the company will increase either franchise grants  master license fees or outlet openings  or if such increases do occur  that they will result in material increments in revenue 
the company and its franchisees compete in the quick service restaurant qsr industry  which is highly competitive with respect to price  service  outlet location and food quality  and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  local and national economic conditions influencing consumer spending habits  population trends and traffic patterns 
in awarding franchises  the company competes with a number of qsr franchisors and other business concepts  as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for outlets 
the company and its franchisees also compete with regional and local franchised and independently owned outlet operations  many of which are larger in terms of financial resources and sales volume  than the company s chain of franchised outlets and its franchisees  respectively 
in addition to these constant obstacles to growth  unforeseen problems could arise which would keep the company from reaching its goals  eg  a strike by an equipment vendor or a material increase in borrowing rates  could temporarily slow down projected openings 
revenue from subfranchise  master license and franchise fees for the twelve months ended june  decreased to  from  for the same period ended the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of such fees 
twelve months ended june  subfranchise fees domestic new subfranchise grants  existing subfranchise expansions   principal payments recognized on deferred subfranchise notes   annual renewal term payments recognized   deferred subfranchise fees recognized   total subfranchise fees   twelve months ended june  master license fees international new master license grants   lump sum payments recognized in current fiscal year   total master license fees   franchise fees recognized domestic   international  total franchise fees   total subfranchise  master license franchise fees   total revenue from subfranchise fees decreased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  during the twelve month period ended june   the company neither granted nor derived any revenue from any new domestic subfranchises  compared to the same period ended june  in which the company granted nine domestic subfranchises and received  in initial subfranchise fees 
three of the nine domestic subfranchises provide for five or seven annual renewal term options  and if all of such options were to be exercised  the company would receive additional subfranchise fee revenues aggregating  this decrease resulted from the substantial achievement of the company s goal of saturating the domestic market with subfranchises 
during the twelve months ended june   domestic subfranchisors expanded and the company received  in fees in connection therewith 
if all renewal term options on these domestic expansions were to be exercised  the company would receive additional subfranchise fee revenues aggregating  by comparison during the twelve months ended june   nine domestic subfranchisors expanded and the company received  in fees 
such increases resulted from the company s efforts to expand beyond the major population centers located in existing subfranchise territories by the expansion of existing subfranchisors 
in addition  during the twelve months ended june   the company recognized  in principal payments received on deferred subfranchise notes due from existing subfranchisors and recognized  in annual renewal term options exercised by subfranchisors  as compared to  recognized in principal payments received on deferred subfranchise notes and  recognized in annual renewal term options exercised by subfranchisors during the twelve months ended june  the above described decreases in recognition of principal payments received on deferred subfranchise notes are directly related to the change  more fully discussed below  with respect to current accounts receivable  of issuing annual renewable subfranchise agreements as opposed to issuing to year subfranchise agreements 
the new agreements have been executed in connection with all subfranchise sales since november  and some subfranchisors operating under the prior agreement are replacing them with the new agreement  thereby eliminating principal and interest payments on the notes connected with the old agreements 
during the twelve months ended june   the company recognized  of deferred subfranchise fees with respect to four subfranchises operating under the prior agreements discussed above  that had sufficiently matured  while during the same period in  the company was able to recognize  in deferred subfranchise fees with respect to subfranchises 
as in the previous fiscal year  the company is continuing to place substantial emphasis on its prospects in the international market 
during the twelve months ended june   the company granted development rights for argentina  uruguay  saudi arabia  united arab emirates  bahrain  oman  qatar  kuwait  greece  cyprus  venezuela  peru  south africa  ontario  poland  northern ireland and the republic of ireland  and received master license fees with respect to such agreements totaling  three of these master license agreements provide for various lump sums totaling  due in fiscal   and during the twelve month period ended june   the company granted seven master licenses and received  in master license fees in connection therewith 
during the twelve months ended june    in lump sum payments due in fiscal  was recognized in accordance with nine master license agreements  as compared to the twelve months ended june  in which  in lump sum payments due  was recognized in accordance with two master license agreements 
as of june  there were five blimpie outlets and grab n go locations operating in sweden  two outlets in spain  four in the united kingdom  two in argentina and four in canada 
total domestic franchise fees recognized decreased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  this decrease is attributable to the decrease to outlets traditional and new concept opened during the twelve months ended june   from outlets traditional and new concept opened during the comparable period ended this decrease in franchise fees recognized is attributable to the fact that many of the new concept outlet openings were the second  third  or fourth outlet opened in the same chain and these franchises were granted at a reduced rate  versus a traditional outlet  to entice the new concept chain to open multiple outlets 
the company derived  in franchise fees from the opening of thirteen international outlets during the twelve month period ended june   while for the same period ended  the company did not derive any revenue from the opening of five international outlets 
store equipment sales to domestic franchises increased to  during the twelve month period ended june  from  for same period ended during these same periods  store equipment sales to international franchises increased  from  these increases were attributable to the increase in orders processed by the company s equipment sales department to orders processed during the twelve month period ended june  from orders processed during the same period ended due to the success and experience obtained from selling equipment to blimpie franchisees  the company has decided to expand the equipment sales department in houston in order to sell equipment to franchisees of other chains 
the company believes this expansion will increase revenue and in turn the net income  however no assurances can be given that this expansion will generate increased revenue or net income 
management fees and other income for the twelve months ended june  decreased to  from  for the same period ended this decrease resulted from the january relocation of one of the company s subfranchisors who had previously been sharing office space in the atlanta office  therefore the fees the company was receiving for reimbursement of a portion of office expenses decreased 
the subfranchisors shares of continuing and franchise fees increased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the same period ended the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of such fees 
twelve months ended june  subfranchisors master licensors share of continuing fees domestic   international   total subfranchisors master licensors share of continuing fees   twelve months ended june  subfranchisors master licensors shares of franchise fees domestic   international  total subfranchisors share of franchise fees   trademark license fees on continuing  franchise  master license subfranchise fees domestic   international   total trademark license fees oncontinuing  franchise  master license subfranchise fees   total subfranchisors master licensors share of continuing franchise fees and trademark license fees on continuing  franchise  master license subfranchise fees   the subfranchisors total share of domestic continuing fees increased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the same period ended the master licensors share of international continuing fees increased to  during the twelve month period ended june  from  during the comparable period in this increase is directly related to the increase in the revenue derived from continuing fees

trademark license fee obligations owed to mbi  and anthony p 
conza and david l 
siegel  the chairman and chief executive  and vice chairman and chief operating officer  respectively  of the company  with respect to international continuing  franchise  subfranchise and master license fees increased to  during the twelve months ended june  from  during the comparable period of due to the overall increase in international revenue 
store equipment cost of sales to domestic franchisees increased to  for the twelve month period ended june  from  for the same period ended during this same twelve month period  store equipment cost of sales to international franchisees increased to  from  these increases are directly attributable to the increase in store equipment sales to domestic and international franchisees

in addition  the increase reflects a charge taken by the company during the first quarter of fiscal in the amount of  which represents the company s share of an arbitrator s award 
see part ii  section i litigation proceedings 
interest income for the twelve months ended june  decreased by to  from  for the comparable period ended this decrease was the result of the selling of a portion of the us treasury notes owned by the company to purchase a portion of the international trademarks and service marks in february see business trademarks  trade names  service marks and logos  know how and methods of operation 
the effective income tax rates income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income were and for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased by to  from  at june  investments under current assets decreased to  from  at june  investments under other assets decreased to  from  at june  trademarks less accumulated amortization increased to  from  at june  these decreases and increases are the direct result of the purchase of a portion of international blimpie trademarks and service marks 
see footnotes to financial statements 
current accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased to  at june  from  at june  deferred revenue decreased as at the same dates  respectively  to  from  said increase and decrease were the direct result of a policy  implemented by the company during fiscal  of issuing annual renewable subfranchise agreements  instead of subfranchise agreements having terms of to years 
under the previous agreements  if the subfranchise fees were collectible over an extended period of time and no reasonable basis existed for estimating collectibility  the fees were deferred and not recognized until they were collected or the uncertainty regarding collectibility was resolved 
under the new agreements  the subfranchisor purchases a territory for a one year period  followed by four to six renewal terms  all but the last being annual in duration 
if all terms and conditions of the agreement have been met during the initial one year term and each of the subsequent one year terms  a to year right is granted during the final renewal term upon payment of the fee set forth in the agreement 
the first year annual fee is recognized when all material services and conditions related to the sale are satisfied by the company 
subsequent years are recognized annually upon renewal 
the company still maintains numerous subfranchise agreements under the prior policy and continues to recognize revenue under these agreements consistent with prior years 
however  the amount of such revenue will continue to decline in the future as some of the prior subfranchise agreements are replaced with the new agreement  upon the subfranchisors request 
the new agreements have been used on all subfranchise sales since november deferred income taxes in current assets and deferred income taxes payable in other liabilities decreased to at june  from  and  respectively  at june  deferred income taxes in other assets and deferred income taxes payable in current liabilities both increased to  and  respectively  from at june  these decreases and increases resulted from the decreases in deferred revenue and the difference in amortization periods for financial accounting purposes  as opposed to tax purposes  applicable to the international trademark purchase consummated in february the company s current portion of notes receivable increased to  at june  from  at june  this was the result of the fact that several master licensors have lump sum payments due in fiscal  therefore these amounts were moved from notes receivable under other assets to current portion of notes receivable 
the company s property  plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation  increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the company s continued modernization and computerization of its offices 
other non current assets increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase primarily resulted from the company s purchase of a new accounting software package 
the company s accounts payable increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the greater number of deferred payment  as opposed to cash on delivery transactions  effected by the company s equipment sales department  coupled with the longer periods that the company takes to pay equipment vendors with respect to purchase transactions financed by the company s franchisees 
in such cases  the company defers payment until the franchisee has given notice to the lender that the equipment has been installed and accepted  and the lender has delivered payment of the financed amount to the company 
accounts payable also increased as a result of the fees payable to the increasing number of subfranchisors 
income taxes payable at june  decreased to  from  at june  this decrease was the result of the payment of income taxes on september  and october   for fiscal year ended june  income taxes that had been accrued  and the decrease in net income 
the payment of fiscal year end bonuses to employees that had been accrued at june   resulted in the decrease in other current liabilities to  at june  from  at june  trademark obligations increased to  at june  from at june  such increase resulted from the recordation of the aggregate value of the remaining shares of common stock issuable by the company in connection with its acquisition of the canadian rights to the blimpie trademarks in october from an unaffiliated party 
such increases also resulted from the recordation of the additional fees payable to anthony p 
conza and david l 
siegel in connection with the february acquisition of the undivided interest in the international rights to the blimpie trademarks and blimpie marketing system which they respectively owned

by comparison  during the twelve months ended june   the company received  from the granting of domestic individual outlet franchises traditional franchises and new concept franchises  and did not derive any revenue from the granting of international individual outlet franchises traditional franchises and new concept franchises 
the decrease in the funds received from the granting of domestic franchises  was the result of a decrease in the actual number of franchises granted  and the reduction of the franchise fee to  for a limited time only to current blimpie franchisees only  to encourage multiple outlet ownership

the increase in fiscal was primarily the result of collections on notes receivable and higher depreciation and amortization  and was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable and deferred revenues 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to lower net income  an increase in notes receivable  and a decrease in income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable

the greater use of cash in fiscal when compared to fiscal was due to the purchase of international trademark rights 
the greater use of cash in fiscal when compared to fiscal was due to the net purchase of investments in that year 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal the increase in the use of cash from fiscal to fiscal was due to the implementation of a plan announced by the company in fiscal to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
as of june  the company had repurchased  shares pursuant to this plan 
the net cash provided in fiscal resulted from the stock offering which occurred in that year 
the company s primary liquidity needs arise from expansion  research and development  capital expenditures and trademark obligations 
these needs are primarily met by the cash flows from operations and from the company s cash and investments 
the company believes that the cash flows from operations and the company s cash and investments will be sufficient to fund its future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
impact of year the company s business and relationships with its business partners and customers depend significantly on a number of computer software programs  internal operating systems and connections to other networks  and the failure of any of these programs  systems or networks to successfully address the year data rollover problem could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many installed computer software and network processing systems currently accept only two digit entries in the date code field and may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to accurately record and process information and transactions on and after january the company utilizes personal computers that are connected to a network for all of its employee workstations 
these personal computers all utilize microsoft windows nt as their operating system 
the company believes that the windows nt operating system is year compliant 
additionally  the company recently installed new software to operate all of its accounting operations 
the company believes this new software  and the computer hardware on which it runs  to be year compliant 
management anticipates that all accounting operations will be performed using the year compliant software by march the majority of the costs of installing and implementing the aforementioned software and hardware had been incurred prior to june  the company anticipates that any additional expenditures to complete the implementation will be funded from cash flow generated by operations 
the company primarily does business with its subfranchisors and its franchisees who in turn deal with retail customers and food distribution companies 
the company has considered the transactions it conducts with its subfranchisors and franchisees in its analyses of the year issue  and believes that it has completed substantially all modifications to the computer systems used in these transactions to ensure the systems are year compliant 
the company is not certain as to whether the computer software and business systems of its franchisees suppliers are year compliant 
the failure or delay of these distributors to successfully address the year issue may result in delays in placing or receiving orders for goods and services at the store level 
such delays may result in lost revenues for the franchisees  and in turn  lower continuing fee revenue for the company 
the company anticipates that such delays and lost revenues  if any  would be minimal 
the company intends to continue to monitor its year compliance and to correct any noncompliance as it is discovered 
management anticipates funding such efforts out of operating cash flow 
the company believes that the effects of any noncompliance on its part  or by its customers and suppliers  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
