during fiscal  the company concluded that the more likely than not criteria appropriately justified the recognition of the remaining amount of the tax benefits previously unrecognized associated with available net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  after giving effect to the benefit of future operating loss carryforwards and other timing differences recognized  the valuation reserve at november  was reduced to zero from million at november   and this adjustment was reflected in the net tax benefit of million recognized in fiscal this compares to the net tax benefit of million and million recognized in fiscal and  respectively  which included reductions in the tax valuation reserve of million and million  respectively

at november   total debt of million was million higher than the year earlier level

these  along with the continued strength of the hart schaffner marx and hickey freeman brands  are anticipated to result in tailored clothing sales growth during  even after reflecting declines from the cerruti and krizia brands due to expiring license arrangements which will not be renewed 
slacks  sportswear and golf apparel continue as important sources for revenue and earnings growth

the current apparel environment continues to be highly competitive  characterized by stable or declining wholesale prices in the moderately priced tailored clothing category  applicable to suits generally retailing for between and gross margin enhancement remains a high priority  and is being addressed through improved manufacturing methods in company production facilities and from a greater percentage of foreign sourcing 
the integration of the plaid business during was an important contributor to the significant reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from to  ongoing programs to leverage administrative functions are continuing  although only modest incremental improvement is likely in debt and related interest expense reduction continue as important elements in enhanced profitability
