the banks operate under written loan policies which attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy  provide sound traditional credit decisions  provide an adequate return and render service to the communities in which the banks are located 
credit reviews and loan examinations help confirm that the banks are adhering to these loan policies 
the banks make both secured and unsecured loans to individuals  firms and corporations  and both consumer and commercial lending operations include various types of credit for the banks customers 
secured loans include first and second real estate mortgage loans 
the banks also make direct installment loans to consumers on both a secured and unsecured basis 
the amount of loans outstanding by loan type at the indicated dates are shown in the following tables according to type of loan december dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer      loans held for sale      percent of loans by category to total loans excluding loans held for sale commercial  financial and agriculture consumer installment real estate the maturity of real estate construction and commercial  financial and agricultural loans outstanding at december  are as follows loan maturities real estate commercial financial construction and agricultural dollars in thousands in one year or less   after one year but within five years   after five years   total   of the real estate construction and commercial loans maturing after one year  approximately  have fixed rates and approximately  have variable rates 
all loans carry some degree of risk 
the risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements by the allowance for credit losses  the amount of loans charged off and the provision for credit losses charged to operating expense 
it is the company s policy that when a loss is identified  it is charged against the credit loss allowance in the current period 
the policy regarding recognition of losses requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to principal repayment 
in addition  consumer installment credit is generally recognized as a loss when it becomes days or more past due  or the consumer has filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws 
a loss will not be recognized if the underlying collateral or the customer s financial position makes a loss improbable 
the company s provision for credit losses is a reflection of actual losses experienced during the year and management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
some of the factors considered by management in determining the amount of the provision and resulting allowance include credit reviews of individual loans  charge offs and recoveries in the current year  growth in the loan portfolio  the current level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels  past due and nonaccruing loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  the composition of the loan portfolio types of loans  and management s estimate of future economic conditions and the resulting impact on the company 
analysis of the allowance for credit losses the following table summarizes loan balances at the end of each year  average loans outstanding during the year and activity in the allowance for credit losses for each of the last five years 
years ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for credit losses at beginning of year      loans charged off commercial  financial  and agricultural   real estate loans  consumer installment   total charged off    recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate loans consumer installment     total recoveries      net recoveries charge offs  allowance acquired disposed of in business combinations provision for credit losses  allowance for credit losses at end of year      loans outstanding  net of unearned interest  excluding held for sale       average loans outstanding  including held for sale  net of unearned interest      ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average net loans outstanding ratio of allowance for credit losses to net loans excluding held for sale outstanding a coordinated effort is undertaken to identify risks in the loan portfolio for management purposes and to establish the credit loss provision and resulting allowance 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the management of the individual banks 
their work is supplemented with reviews by the company s internal audit program and the use of external loan review firms 
bank regulatory agencies provide additional levels of review 
this process provides information which helps in assessing the quality of the portfolio  assists in the prompt identification of problems and potential problems and aids in deciding if a loan represents a loss which should be recorded immediately or a risk for which an allowance should be maintained 
management believes this continuous effort will identify the majority of potential problem loans and recognize their impact on future earnings 
if  as a result of the company s loan review and evaluation procedures  it is determined that payment of interest on a commercial or real estate loan is questionable  it is the company s policy to reverse interest previously accrued on the loan against interest income 
interest on such loans is thereafter recorded on a cash basis and is included in earnings only when actually received in cash and when full payment of principal is no longer doubtful 
a loan can be reinstated to full accrual status when and if the borrower s financial condition and payment performance can justify sustainable performance of all conditions and terms of the loan 
allocation of allowance for credit losses the company has allocated the allowance for credit losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary at each year end to provide for losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below  based on the previous year s gross charge offs in each category as a percentage of total charge offs 
the components of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five years are presented below 
allowance allocation by loan category dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agriculture      consumer installment      real estate     although it is the company s policy to immediately charge off all loan amounts judged uncollectible  historical experience indicates that certain losses exist in the loan portfolio  which have not been specifically identified 
to anticipate and provide for these unidentifiable losses  the allowance for credit losses is established by charging the provision for loan loss expense against current earnings 
no portion of the resulting allowance is in any way allocated or restricted to any individual loan or group of loans 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans 
the following table presents nonperforming loans at december     and nonperforming loans consist solely of loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing past due loans and loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis nonaccrual loans 
nonperforming loans past due loans nonaccrual loans dollars in thousands december   december   december   december   december   total interest income recognized on nonperforming loans for the year ended december  was  additional interest income of  would have been recorded in if all nonperforming loans had performed in accordance with their original terms

the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans including loans past due ninety days or more was at december   compared to at december  management considers the current level of the allowance for credit losses more than adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance  or the availability of new information  could cause the allowance for credit losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
generally  the company s market areas have not experienced rapid increases in real estate property values or significant overbuilding 
therefore  in management s opinion  collateral values for real estate loans in the company s market areas should not be vulnerable to significant deterioration  as would other market areas that have experienced rapidly increasing property values and significant overbuilding 
however  collateral values  are difficult to estimate and are subject to change depending on economic conditions  the supply of and demand for properties  and other factors 
the company attempts to mitigate the risky nature of real estate lending by adhering to conservative loan underwriting standards and by diversifying the portfolio within its market area and within industry groups 
investment securities the carrying values of investment securities at the indicated dates are presented below december dollars in thousands us treasury and us government agencies    state and municipals    mortgage backed securities    other    total    investment portfolio policy stresses quality and liquidity 
at december   the weighted average maturity of u 
s 
treasury and government agency securities was years and the weighted average maturity of obligations of states and political subdivisions was years 
mortgage backed securities had a weighted average maturity of years due to purchases of adjustable rate mortgage securities that adjust annually 
overall  the weighted average maturity of the portfolio was years using contractual maturities and slightly greater than years using expected maturities 
expected maturities differ from contractual maturities because security issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
securities purchased during the last several years have primarily short to intermediate term maturities 
the following table shows the contractual maturities of investment securities at december  and the average yields for all obligations on a fully taxable basis assuming a tax rate on such securities maturity distribution of investment securities due within one due after one within due after five within year five years ten years due after ten years amount yield amount yeild amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us treasury and us government agencies     state and municipals     mortgage backed securities     total     the estimated fair market value of the company s investment portfolio at december   was approximately  above amortized cost 
market values vary significantly as interest rates change  however  management expects normal maturities in the portfolio to meet and exceed liquidity requirements 
of the tax free securities rated by moody s investors service  inc  are rated a or better 
non rated securities are principally issued by various political subdivisions within the state of georgia 
the portfolio is carefully monitored to assure there is no unreasonable concentration of securities in the obligations of a single debtor 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of the company and affects the company s ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
assets  consisting principally of loans and investment securities  are funded by customer deposits  borrowed funds  and retained earnings 
the investment portfolio is one of the company s primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds that are available for cash needs 
contractual investment securities that mature within one year total million 
however  mortgage backed securities and securities with call provisions create cash flows earlier than the contractual maturities 
estimates of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and call provisions on federal agency and state and municipals increase the forecasted cash flow from the investment portfolio within one year to approximately million 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds 
the company s liquidity also continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable core deposit base

stockholders equity the company maintains a ratio of stockholders equity to total assets that is adequate relative to industry standards 
the company s ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the company and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy risk based measure and leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to enhance the value of holding liquid assets 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
recently the federal reserve and the fdic proposed that interest rate risk be considered in computing risk based capital ratios 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier i capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier i capital and tier ii capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve and the fdic also adopted regulations which supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum leverage ratio of of tier i capital to total assets less goodwill the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage to higher than the minimum level 
the following table summarizes the company s capital ratios at december  and minimum requirements tier capital leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio the company issued million of preferred securities in november the proceeds of the securities qualifies as tier capital with respect to the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
federal reserve guidelines for calculation of tier capital limit the amount of cumulative preferred stock which can be included in tier capital to of total tier capital

through the provision  the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that management believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review the company s subsidiary banks allowance for credit losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require the company s subsidiary banks to recognize additions to their allowance for credit losses 
management s analysis of the allowance for credit losses  nonperforming assets  and net recoveries on a monthly basis concluded that the allowance was more than adequate given the risk resident within the loan portfolio 
the allowance as a percent of total loans is  nonperforming loans to total loans are  and net recoveries as a percent of average loans net of unearned interest were for the year other income total other income increased million in  or as compared to the majority of the increase was due to an increase in mortgage banking income of million  or

capability of the company s data processing software to accommodate the year like many financial institutions  the company and its subsidiaries rely upon computers for the daily conduct of their business and for data processing generally 
there is concern among industry experts that commencing on january   computers will be unable to read the new year and there may be widespread computer malfunctions 
management of the company has assessed the electronic systems  programs  applications and other electronic components used in the operations of the company and believes the it s hardware and software has been programmed to be able to accurately recognize the year  and that significant additional costs will not be incurred in connection with the year issue  although there can be no assurances in this regard 
forward looking statements the following appears in accordance with the securities litigation reform act 
these financial statements and financial review include forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
those factors include fluctuations in interest rates  inflation  government regulations  economic conditions  and competition in the geographic business areas in which the company conducts its operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities which are commonly pass through securities 
finally  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of the company s asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is the policy of the company to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
the table below has two measures of gap  regulatory and management adjusted 
the regulatory gap considers only contractual maturities or repricings 
the management adjusted gap considers such things as prepayments on certain interest rate sensitive assets and the circumstances under which core deposits are repriced 
although interest bearing transaction accounts are available to reprice in the three month window  historical experiences show these deposits more stable over the course of one year 
the management adjusted gap indicates the company to be somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
the company uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining  and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
the most recent simulation model projects net interest income would increase if rates rise gradually over the next year 
on the other hand  the model projects net interest income to decline 
if rate decline over the next year 
company policy states that net interest income cannot change over using this analysis and presently  the company is within policy guidelines
