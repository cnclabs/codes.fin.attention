as a result of debt incurred in connection with the company s acquisition of ccc  the company became highly leveraged

the company has evaluated the establishment of technological feasibility of its product in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company sells its products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
accordingly  the company has concluded that technological feasibility is not established until the development stage of the product is nearly complete 
the company defines technological feasibility as the completion of a working model 
the time period during which costs could be capitalized  from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release  is very short and  consequently  the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
