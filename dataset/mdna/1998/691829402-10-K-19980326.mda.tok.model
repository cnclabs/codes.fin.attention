ibc was merged into the company 
oxis sa operates as a subsidiary of the company 
in july  the company acquired therox pharmaceuticals  inc therox through an exchange of stock 
therox was merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition of therox provided the company with a technology portfolio complementary to its novel therapeutics for treatment of free radical associated diseases together with university relationships and seven patents 
on december   the company acquired innovative medical systems corp 
ims 
ims develops  manufactures  markets and sells medical equipment 
the acquisitions of all four companies described above were completed through the exchange of stock and were accounted for as purchases  accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the dates of the acquisitions 
because the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases  the company s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition only 
therefore  the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations from september   the results of therox s operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from july   and the results of ims operations will only be included in the company s consolidated statement of operations beginning january  costs relating to the acquisitions and the company s more complex corporate structure and the increased research and development investments have placed significant demand on the company s limited financial resources 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources below 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital position improved during to  as of december  from a deficit of  as of december  this increase in working capital resulted primarily from the proceeds from issuance of common stock of  plus  in net working capital resulting from the acquisition of ims  offset by the effect of the net loss for  less non cash charges of 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december   to  at december  however  the company expects to continue to report losses in as the level of expenses is expected to continue to exceed revenues 
the company can give no assurances as to when and if its revenues will exceed its expenses 
the company must raise additional capital during the first half of failure to raise such additional capital would cause the company to severely curtail or cease operations 
for more information concerning the company s ability to continue as a going concern  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that its new products and technologies show considerable promise  its ability to realize significant revenues therefrom is dependent upon the company s success in developing business alliances with biotechnology and or pharmaceutical companies that have the required resources to develop and market certain of these products 
there is no assurance that the company s effort to develop such business alliances will be successful 
although the company is currently seeking additional capital as described below  it cannot predict the source  terms  amount  form  and or availability of additional capital to fund its operations to the end of the current year 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  the company raised approximately  cash through the sale of its common stock in a public offering to european investors 
substantial additional capital will be required during to continue operating in accordance with management s current plans 
if sufficient capital is raised during  the company expects that research and development expenditures for will be similar to the amount 
the company has engaged agents to assist on a best efforts basis to complete a private placement of its common stock 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will successfully raise the needed capital 
if the company is unable to raise additional capital during the first half of  it would endeavor to extend its ability to continue in business through the substantial reduction of personnel and facility costs particularly in the therapeutics business  by slowing research and development efforts  and by reducing other operating costs  however  no assurances can be given that it will be able to do so 
if the company were to be unable to sufficiently curtail its costs in such a situation  it might be forced to seek protection of the courts through reorganization  bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings 
information systems and the year as is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations  the company is in the process of addressing the year problem 
the company is currently engaged in a project to review computer software to determine whether its programs will consistently and properly recognize the year certain of the company s systems include hardware and packaged software recently purchased from vendors who have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
the company plans to replace certain other hardware and packaged software during the next year regardless of the year problem 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test all of its software for year compliance  and the company expects to complete the project in early the cost for this project is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues the company s sales for the past three years consisted of the following diagnostic and research assays    bovine superoxide dismutase bsod for research and human use    palosein r bsod for veterinary use    other    total sales    diagnostic and research assay sales volumes have increased modestly in each of the last two years  resulting in a increases in sales in and bulk bsod sales in included sales to sanofi winthrop  inc sales of bulk bsod to sanofi winthrop ceased in  when sanofi winthrop announced that the clinical trial in which it was using the company s bsod failed to show the desired results 
the decline in sales to sanofi winthrop has been offset by increases in sales of bsod to tedec meiji farma sa  the company s spanish licensee 
the decrease in bulk bsod sales in as compared to was due primarily to the decline in the value of the dutch guilder the currency in which the sales have been made as compared to the us dollar 
future sales of bulk bsod are largely dependent on the needs of the company s spanish licensee which are uncertain and difficult to predict and no assurances can be given that the company will continue to sell bulk bsod to its spanish licensee 
sales of palosein r  which is sold primarily to veterinary wholesalers in the united states and europe  declined from  in to  in due in part to large stocking orders by distributors in late palosein r sales increased by  to  in as a result of an increase in volume  particularly in export sales 
the decrease in other sales in was principally the result of the completion of an assay development contract in early other sales increased in primarily due to sales of ergothioneine  a fine chemical synthesized in the company s french research facility 
costs and expenses cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased to in from in cost of sales increased further in  to of product sales 
the increases in both years were primarily caused by declines in the gross margin on bulk bsod sales 
the company s cost of sales includes amortization of technology acquired in amortization of  in and and  in 
research and development costs increased from  in  to  in the increase of  in is the result of increased expenditures relating to preclinical development work and the phase i clinical trial on the company s lead therapeutics program glutathione peroxidase mimics of approximately  and a  increase in expenses of the former therox operations  offset by a cost reduction of approximately  from the closure of the company s mountain view  california facility in the fourth quarter of the expenses of the therox operations are included in the expenses starting in july  the former therox laboratory facility was closed in may research and development costs decreased by  in  to  this reduction in expenses was due primarily to reductions in expenses of the company s french subsidiary 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by  from  in to  in  and declined by an additional  to  in most of the decreases resulted from a reduction in the selling  general and administrative expenses of the company s french subsidiary 
in the third quarter of all of the company s manufacturing operations were consolidated in the united states and the french subsidiary became a research facility 
in connection with this restructuring  two administrative positions have been eliminated and certain other costs which were previously charged to administrative expenses have subsequently been classified as research and development costs 
the administrative costs of the company s french subsidiary decreased  in as compared to  and decreased an additional  in expenses included a charge of  to operations for  reflecting the write off of purchased in process technology  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net loss the company incurred net losses in  and  and does not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future 
the loss includes a  
per share charge to operations for the write off of purchased in process technology related to the acquisition of therox 
excluding this unusual charge  the company would have incurred a net loss  or 
per share for  as compared to a net loss of  or 
per share for and a net loss of  or 
per share for the increased loss for as compared to excluding the unusual charge is attributable primarily to the increased research and development costs relating to the company s glutathione peroxidase mimics program 
decreases in research and development and sales  general and administrative expenses resulted in the decrease in the net loss for the decrease in net loss per share in is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
the company expects to incur a substantial net loss for if substantial additional capital is raised through further sales of securities see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  the company plans to continue to invest in research and development activities and incur sales  general and administrative expenses in amounts greater than its anticipated near term product margins 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital  it will have to cease  or severely curtail  its operations 
in this event  while expenses will be reduced  expense levels  and the potential write down of various assets  would still be in amounts greater than anticipated revenues
