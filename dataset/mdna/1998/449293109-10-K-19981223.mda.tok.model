item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s net revenues in recent years have increased due to a variety of factors  including acquisitions and  in many cases  increased sales volumes in both existing and acquired business lines 
the company s revenue is classified within two operating segments oilfield services and petrochemical processing 
oilfield services revenues include revenues derived from i exploration sales and services new tubular goods inspection  ii production sales and services reclamation  reconditioning and inspection of used tubular goods and sucker rods  iii corrosion control services coating of tubular goods and sucker rods  and iv other sales and services oilfield engine sales and services in canada 
petrochemical processing revenues include revenues derived from i grinding petrochemicals into powders size reduction  including other ancillary services and the sale of grinding equipment manufactured by the company  ii compounding sales and services  which includes the manufacture and sale of concentrates  and iii distributing plastic powders 
distribution revenues include the operating results of the ico polymers companies and the distribution operations of rotec and verplast  all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and operate in europe 
distribution revenues also include a majority of the revenues generated by jr courtenay nz ltd 
which operates in new zealand and australia and a small portion of the revenues generated by wedco in the united states 
the company s distribution operations utilize the company s size reduction and compounding facilities to process petrochemical products prior to sale 
service revenues in both of the company s business segments are recorded as the services are performed or  in the case of product sales  upon shipment to third parties 
many of the petrochemical acquisitions since fiscal  particularly the acquisition of bayshore in december  and the expansion of the company s distribution business within the petrochemical processing segment  had the effect of reducing overall petrochemical processing margins as a percentage of revenues 
the gross margin percentages for the distribution business and bayshore s business are  generally  significantly lower than those generated by the company s size reduction services 
bayshore and several of the acquired companies  as well as the company s distribution operations  typically buy raw materials  improve the material and then sell the finished product 
the distribution operations utilize the company s processing facilities to improve the raw materials 
in contrast  many of the company s size reduction operations typically involve processing customer owned material referred to as toll processing 
cost of sales and services is primarily comprised of compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity and equipment costs and supplies  and  in the case of bayshore and the company s distribution business  purchased raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  accounting  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
the demand for the company s oilfield products services is dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and the level of oil and natural gas production and exploration activity 
in addition to changes in commodity prices  exploration and production activities are affected by worldwide economic conditions  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  seasonal trends and the political stability of oil producing countries 
the oil and gas industry has been very volatile over the past several years  due in large part to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
during fiscal and  the oil and gas service industry generally experienced increased demand and improved product and service pricing as a result of improved commodity prices and greater levels of oil and gas exploration and production activity  due in large part  to a strong world economy 
in fiscal oil prices declined significantly versus fiscal levels 
gas prices declined to a lesser extent during the period 
among other reasons  these trends have been attributed to an excess worldwide oil supply  lower domestic energy demand due to an unseasonably warm winter and declining demand due to the economic downturn in southeast asia 
as oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices have declined  demand for oilfield products and services  including those provided by the company  has softened 
a significant decline in oil and  to a lesser extent  gas prices has occurred since the end of fiscal  which has increased these effects 
if the current low level of oil and gas prices persists  the company s oilfield service revenues and income can be expected to be adversely impacted 
although the company is optimistic that market conditions will improve long term  the timing of such a recovery cannot be predicted with certainty 
liquidity and capital resources the following are considered by management as key measures of liquidity applicable to the company cash and cash equivalents   working capital   current ratio debt to capitalization 
to 
to year ended september  compared to year ended september  cash and cash equivalents decreased  during fiscal year due to the factors described below 
the company s working capital decreased during fiscal year from  at september  to  at september  as a result of the factors described below 
for the fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities decreased to  compared to  for the year ended september  despite comparable net income and increased depreciation and amortization expenses  the decrease was primarily due to the gain on sale of the wedtech equity investment classified as an investing activity and various changes in working capital accounts particularly changes in accounts receivable and inventory 
capital expenditures totaled  during fiscal  of which  related to the oilfield services segment and  related to the petrochemical processing segment 
the remaining  were general corporate expenditures 
specifically   of the expenditures incurred during fiscal year were used to expand the company s laporte  texas compounding facility which was completed in may most of the capital expenditures made during fiscal year were intended to expand or increase the efficiency of the company s existing base of operations  as opposed to maintaining current operating facilities 
the company anticipates that fiscal capital expenditures will be significantly lower than fiscal expenditures 
fiscal capital expenditure requirements are expected to be financed using existing cash and or funds available under domestic and foreign credit facilities 
also  see item year issue 
cash flows provided by used for financing activities declined to  during fiscal year compared to  during fiscal the decline was primarily due to the issuance in june of the  senior notes 
the debt matures june   without prior principle amortization  and interest is payable on june and december of each year beginning december  during fiscal years through  the company acquired fifteen businesses 
during fiscal  the company used  of cash to acquire three businesses 
these acquisitions were made primarily using available cash  the issuance of the company s common stock and the assumption of outstanding debt of the acquired business 
the company anticipates it will continue to seek acquisitions in the future 
as of november   the company had approximately  of additional borrowing capacity available under various credit arrangements 
 is available under the company s domestic credit facility and the remaining amount is available under various foreign facilities 
currently  the company has no outstanding indebtedness under the domestic credit facility 
the terms of the company s domestic credit facility and the senior notes limit the amount of liens and additional indebtedness incurred by the company 
the domestic credit facility is secured by certain receivables and inventories and requires maintenance of certain financial ratios including minimum tangible net worth  profitability and maximum total debt to capitalization 
the company s foreign facilities are generally secured by various company owned assets and also carry various financial covenants

consolidated revenues increased  during fiscal compared to fiscal the revenue growth resulted primarily from the business acquisitions made by the company during fiscal and and  to a lesser extent  internal growth within both of the company s business segments 
oilfield service revenues increased  or to  during fiscal the revenue growth was driven primarily by the fiscal oilfield service acquisitions and the increased demand for the company s services during the first half of fiscal during the third quarter  the revenue growth rate declined  and revenues contracted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to fiscal exploration services revenues increased  or during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily a result of the effects of an acquisition 
the company s exploration services are driven  in large part  by the domestic rig count which declined significantly over the course of fiscal  however  the average fiscal domestic rig count was down only slightly versus the fiscal average 
exploration service revenues were consistent with the change of the average rig count  down less than  absent the effect of an acquisition 
production service revenues increased  during fiscal compared to  mostly due to an acquisition  rather than internal growth 
production service revenues are driven by the level of production activity  which in turn  is dependent upon oil and gas prices and the level of rig workover activity 
during fiscal  average oil and gas prices and the workover rig count were down compared to fiscal despite this fact  production service revenues increased modestly during fiscal  excluding the effect of the curley s acquisition 
corrosion control revenues improved  during compared to fiscal this revenue growth resulted from relatively strong gulf of mexico activity compared to other oil and gas production and exploration geographical areas 
other oilfield sales and services consist of the company s canadian oilfield engine sales and reconditioning business 
these revenues declined primarily as a result of declining oil prices during fiscal compared to fiscal petrochemical processing revenues increased  or during fiscal compared to fiscal of this growth  resulted from the fiscal and acquisitions  all of which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the results of each acquired entity is included in the company s consolidated results only from the date of the acquisition forward 
size reduction services and other sales and services revenues improved to  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal  representing an increase of  
in addition to the effect of the business acquisitions  these revenues increased due to internal growth in the company s domestic and european operations 
compounding sales and services revenues increased  or almost entirely due to the fiscal and acquisitions  particularly the acquisition of bayshore 
distribution revenues rose  or  primarily due to the acquisitions and the growth of the company s european distribution operations 
worldwide revenues of one petrochemical processing customer comprised approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
costs and expenses 
gross margins calculated as total revenues minus total costs of sales and services  as a percentage of revenues in fiscal declined to compared to in fiscal the declines resulted primarily from the revenue growth in the petrochemical business segment and  particularly in the distribution business  which  in the aggregate  generates lower gross margins as a percentage of revenues 
within the company s oilfield service business  gross margins as a percentage of revenues declined approximately to 
the decline resulted primarily from a change in the relative mixture of various product sales and service revenues rather than a significant change in average prices 
petrochemical processing gross margins declined from  of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal the decline is primarily due to the significant increases in lower margin compounding and distribution revenues as a percentage of total petrochemical processing revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal generally  gross margins as a percentage of revenues of the company s size reduction operations  performed on a toll basis  are higher than the gross margins of the oilfield service operations 
conversely  the gross margins of the company s concentrate and ground petrochemical powder manufacturing and distribution businesses are generally lower than oilfield service gross margins  as a percentage of revenues  due to the higher raw material cost component included in these revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from  during fiscal to  during fiscal the increase resulted from the timing of the fiscal and acquisitions  and an increase in corporate administration and oilfield service expenses 
corporate expenses rose primarily due to an increase in legal and bonus expenses 
a majority of fiscal legal expenses related to legal matters discussed in item legal proceedings included in this form k 
two of the legal matters  which comprised a significant portion of fiscal legal expenses  have been concluded favorably 
the bonus expense increase was due to bonuses of  paid by the company to over employees during the first quarter of fiscal and was classified as a general corporate expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began to reduce oilfield service selling  general and administrative expenses based upon the reduced levels of activity in this business and has continued to reduce such expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the change was primarily the result of the increases in expenses  described above  offset by the effect of increased distribution and compounding revenues 
generally  the company s distribution and compounding operations incur lower selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than the company s other sales and services 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase resulted from additions of property  plant and equipment and goodwill primarily due to the acquisitions made during fiscal and the timing of acquisitions  as well as increased amortization of debt issuance costs related to the june senior notes placement 
operating income 
operating income declined from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease was due to the changes in revenues and costs and expenses discussed above 
gain on sale of equity investment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of  on the sale of the company s equity ownership in wedtech inc the company received cash of  and recorded an after tax gain of  on the sale 
interest income expense 
net interest expense was  during fiscal for fiscal  the company incurred net interest expense of  this change was primarily the result of the june issuance of  senior notes and  to a lesser extent  debt assumed in connection with the fiscal and acquisitions 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to during fiscal  compared to during fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the sale of the company s equity investment in wedtech which created tax expense equal to of the pre tax gain  an increase in permanent book to tax differences relative to pre tax income  offset by the effect of a decline in the company s italian operations income tax rates 
as non deductible goodwill amortization continues to increase  due to future acquisitions  the company would anticipate that future effective tax rates  likewise  would increase 
additionally  the company s overall tax rate varies depending upon the mixture of pre tax income generated by the company s operations in various taxing jurisdictions 
see note segment and foreign operations information to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has  for tax return purposes   in net operating loss carryforwards  which expire between and  and  in investment  alternative minimum and other tax credit carryforwards 
all of the tax credits are expected to expire unused  except for  in alternative minimum tax credits  which have no expiration 
net income 
for fiscal  the company had net income of  as compared to net income of  for fiscal  due to the factors described above 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the dutch guilder  swedish krona  british pound  italian lira  canadian dollar  and the french franc have impacted the translation of revenues and income of the company s european petrochemical processing operations and canadian oilfield services operations over the past two years 
the table below summarizes the impact of the above currencies during the twelve months ended september  compared to the exchange rates used to translate the twelve months ended september  net revenues  operating income  pre tax income  net income  gains and losses from the translation of certain balance sheet accounts are not included in determining net income  but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity 
as a result of the dollar s fluctuation against applicable foreign currencies  shareholders equity increased by  during fiscal during april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that companies expense as incurred costs of start up activities and organization costs 
the company is required to adopt sop in its financial statements for the fiscal year ending september  upon adoption  the company will be required to expense approximately  of organization costs and will account for the adoption of sop as the cumulative effect of an accounting change under apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  or during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted from an increase in both oilfield services revenues and petrochemical processing revenues 
oilfield service revenues increased  or during fiscal versus revenues improved within all oilfield service business lines and such growth  rather than being due to acquisitions  was primarily driven internally 
as a result of an increasing domestic rig count which increased demand for the company s services  exploration sales and services revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to a majority of this increase resulted from an increase in revenues for the company s houston  texas facility  which benefitted from increased drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
production sales and services revenues increased  or  driven by modestly higher average oil and gas prices in fiscal versus much of these revenue gains were due to increased demand for the company s services in the west texas and canadian markets 
corrosion control sales and services revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to this improvement resulted from increased drilling activity  the success of the company s new product lines and  to a lesser extent  higher average sales prices 
other sales and services consisted of revenues generated by the company s canadian subsidiary  shearer  relating to the reconditioning and selling of engines used in connection with oil well pumping equipment 
petrochemical processing sales and services revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to this increase was almost entirely due to the timing of the fiscal and petrochemical processing acquisitions 
since all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  the company included  in its consolidated statement of operations the acquired companies results of operations only from the date of acquisition 
during the year ended september   sales to a single customer within the petrochemical processing segment accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
costs and expenses 
gross profit calculated as total revenues minus total costs of sales and services  as a percentage of revenues in fiscal declined to from in within the oilfield service business  gross profits as a percentage of revenues improved due to increased sales volumes which resulted in increased utilization of operating facilities and  to a lesser extent  modest average price improvements within some of the company s oilfield services markets  without a proportionate increase in costs and expenses 
the overall decline in gross profits  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal as compared to was attributable to the increase in compounding sales and distribution of material revenues which generate lower gross profits as a percentage of revenues 
generally  gross profits as a percentage of revenues are higher within the company s size reduction operations  which are typically performed on a toll basis  as compared to the company s oilfield service operations 
conversely  the gross profits as a percentage of sales of the company s concentrate manufacturing included in compounding sales and services revenues and distribution of material revenues tend to be significantly lower  due to the significant raw material cost component included in these revenues 
selling  general and administrative costs increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due to the timing of the fiscal and acquisitions and to a lesser extent  higher legal expenses and higher corporate administrative expenses  offset by lower bonus expenses and lower litigation settlement charges 
also  fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses included capital based state franchise taxes which were not included in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was also the result of the fiscal and acquisitions and the increase in distribution revenues resulting from the establishment of the ico polymers companies in europe 
these factors have resulted in the company s corporate expenses being spread across a greater revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase resulted from additions of property  plant and equipment and goodwill due primarily to the acquisitions made during fiscal and operating income 
operating income improved to  in fiscal from an operating loss of  in fiscal oilfield services operating income increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal improvement within the oilfield service business was driven by the increase in revenues and gross profit margins and the  charge for inventory writedowns in fiscal a similar inventory charge was not required in fiscal petrochemical processing sales and services operating income improved to  in fiscal from a loss of  in this increase in petrochemical processing operating income resulted from the timing of the fiscal and petrochemical processing acquisitions  the charges relating to sfas impairment  and non recurring compensation arrangements  which were unnecessary in fiscal general corporate expenses declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decline resulted primarily from non recurring and other litigation charges  and non recurring compensation arrangements  in fiscal  neither of which was required in fiscal additionally  legal expenses and corporate administrative expenses were higher and bonus expenses were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the change was due to the issuance of the  senior notes  the utilization of cash balances and the assumption of debt in connection with the fiscal and acquisitions 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate increased to during fiscal compared to in fiscal this change was the result of an increase in non deductible goodwill amortization which  unlike fiscal  was not offset by a reversal of the company s valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
the company s effective tax rate also varied as a result of the mixture of domestic and foreign pre tax income since  during fiscal  the company s domestic effective tax rate is higher than the average effective tax rate of foreign operations 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the dutch guilder  swedish krona  british pound  italian lira  canadian dollar  and the french franc have impacted the translation of revenues and income of the company s european petrochemical processing operations and canadian oilfield services operations over the past two years 
the table below summarizes the impact of the above currencies during the twelve months ended september  compared to the exchange rates used to translate the five months ended september  net revenues  operating income  pre tax income  net income  gains and losses from the translation of certain balance sheet accounts are not included in determining net income  but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity 
as a result of the dollar s fluctuation against applicable foreign currencies  shareholders equity decreased by  in fiscal seasonality 
the oilfield services business is substantially seasonal  reflecting the pattern of oil field drilling and workovers  with the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal years having generally higher levels of activity 
seasonal trends  however  may be masked by other market forces such as a decline in oil and gas prices 
year issue the securities and exchange commission has published guidance regarding the effect of year issues on companies 
the year problem arose because some computer programs use only the last two digits of a year as a reference date  causing the program to improperly recognize a year that does not begin with 
the company has been working toward year readiness since and is proceeding on schedule 
completion of the project is scheduled for the fourth fiscal quarter of to improve access to business information through common  integrated computing systems within business operations  the company has begun a business systems replacement project 
the new systems business replacement systems  which are expected to make the company s business computer systems year compliant  are scheduled for completion by september implementation of these programs is approximately percent complete 
the company has developed a contingency plan to make the programs that are scheduled to be replaced by these systems year compliant 
a decision to implement the contingency plan will be made by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of remaining business software programs  including those supplied by vendors  are expected to be made year compliant through the year project or they will be retired 
overview 
the company s project is divided into four sections corporate and facility infrastructure  applications software  inspection and processing equipment  and third party suppliers 
each section consists of four phases year readiness analysis and assessment  retiring  replacing  or upgrading items that are not year ready  remediation testing of upgraded and replacement hardware and software  and contingency planning 
applications software 
the application software section includes the conversion of software which is not year compliant or  where available from the supplier  the replacement of such software 
application software consists of all software not used directly in conjunction with the operation of the company s manufacturing and service facilities 
the company estimates that the software conversion phase was more than percent complete at september   and that the remaining conversions are on schedule to be completed by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter the testing phase is conducted as the software is replaced and is scheduled to be completed in the company s third fiscal quarter of contingency planning for this section is scheduled to begin in the second fiscal quarter of and completed by the end of the third fiscal quarter of corporate infrastructure 
the corporate infrastructure section consists of mainframe and desktop computing hard ware  software  and connectivity 
the company believes its north american infrastructure is year compliant  and the company will test this infrastructure in the second fiscal quarter of to confirm such compliance 
the company s european infrastructure is being replaced  and the completion of the replacement process is scheduled for the end of the first fiscal quarter of the company s australian and new zealand corporate infrastructures are percent complete and are expected to be year compliant by the end of the second fiscal quarter of facility infrastructure 
the facility infrastructure section consists of hardware and systems software  which is used in the operation of the company s facilities 
the company has developed a plan detailing the tasks and resources required for this section 
the assessment of the year readiness of facility infrastructure was begun during the first fiscal quarter of the testing and repair of facility infrastructure is scheduled for completion during the third fiscal quarter of for the company s north american operations and during the second fiscal quarter of for the company s european  australian  and new zealand operations 
contingency planning for this section is scheduled to begin in the second fiscal quarter of and to be completed by mid inspection and processing equipment 
the company s oilfield services sector uses inspection and processing equipment  which the company believes to be currently year compliant 
the equipment is scheduled to be tested and repaired  if necessary  during the quarter ended december  the company does not foresee the need for any contingency planning in this area 
third party suppliers 
the company has begun identifying critical third party suppliers 
the company will begin communicating with suppliers of the company s operations in north america  europe  and new zealand  during the first quarter of fiscal  about  and evaluating their state of  year preparedness 
ninety percent of the suppliers to the company s australian operations have been verified for compliance 
the company wide evaluation process is scheduled for completion by the end of the second fiscal quarter these evaluations will be followed by the development of contingency plans  which are scheduled for completion by mid fiscal costs 
the total cost associated with required software and hardware modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately  the total amount expended on the project through september  was  the estimated future cost of completing the year project is estimated to be approximately  the cost to implement the business replacement systems is not included in these estimates 
costs related to the year project will be accounted for in accordance with the company s existing policies 
other than purchases of new hardware and software  year project expenditures will be expensed as incurred 
risks 
a year failure could result in a business disruption that adversely affects the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  if a year failure causes insufficient rail and freight service to be available to the company  the receipt of raw materials and the shipment of finished products by the company s petrochemical operations could be curtailed 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company cannot determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
conversion to the euro currency the company has a substantial portion of its operations within countries adopting the euro currency beginning january  as of january   the company expects to invoice and receive payments denominated in euros whenever possible 
the cost of achieving this is not expected to be material 
the adoption of the euro by the european economic and monetary union is expected  from a competitive viewpoint  to benefit the company to some extent as price transparency becomes a reality 
the benefit will  however  be somewhat limited as transportation costs are an important consideration for the company s customers 
at this time  the company anticipates that the impact of the adopting of the euro with regard to currency exchange and taxation implications will not have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial condition of the company 
additionally  material contractual agreements of the company are expected to continue without disruption 
forward looking statements the statements contained in all parts of this document  including  but not limited to  timing of new services or facilities  ability to compete  effect of enhanced distribution capability  future capital expenditures  effects of compliance with laws  effects of the euro adoption  matters relating to operating facilities  effect and cost of litigation and remediation  future liquidity  future capital expenditures  future acquisitions  future market conditions  reductions in expenses  derivative transactions  effects of the year issue  future growth plans  financial results and any other statements which are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
when words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  intend  expect  plan and similar expressions are used  they are intended to identify the statements as forward looking 
actual results  performance or achievements can differ materially from results suggested by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those described elsewhere in this document in the company s other filings with the sec and those described below 
the significant indebtedness incurred as a result of the placement of the senior notes due in june has several important implications for the company  including  but not limited to  the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to service the company s indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be restricted  iii the company s flexibility to expand  make capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be impaired future acquisitions may require the company to alter its capitalization significantly  which changes may significantly alter the leverage of the company  iv the indenture relating to the senior notes contains  and future agreements relating to the company s indebtedness may contain  numerous financial and other restrictive covenants  including  among other things  limitations on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens and other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or to merge or consolidate with another entity failure to comply with these provisions may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company  and v the ability of the company to satisfy its obligations pursuant to such indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and management  financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the business and operations of the company  some of which are not in the company s control 
to the extent that the company is unable to repay the principal amount of the notes out of cash on hand  it may i seek to repay the notes with the proceeds of an equity offering  ii seek refinancing  or iii sell significant assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the forgoing alternatives will be available to the company at all or on terms that are favorable to the company 
if the company cannot satisfy its obligations related to such indebtedness  substantially all of the company s long term debt could be in default and could be declared immediately due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates through its oilfield services industry historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s oilfield services depends principally upon the level of domestic oil and gas drilling and workover activity  which  in turn  depends upon factors such as the level of oil and gas prices  expectations about future oil and gas prices  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  worldwide weather conditions  international political  military  regulatory and economic conditions and the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital 
oil prices and  to a lesser extent  gas prices have declined significantly during  which has resulted in decreases and could result in further decreases in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
no assurance can be given that current low levels of domestic oil and gas exploration activities will improve or that the demand for the company s oilfield services will not continue to decline reflecting the generally low level of activity in the industry 
industry conditions will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company will have no control 
a continued decline or lack of improvement in oil or gas prices or domestic industry activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s oilfield service business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  the oilfield services business is substantially seasonal  reflecting the pattern of oilfield drilling and workovers  with the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal years having generally higher levels of activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states 
the business cycles of the company s petrochemical processing services segment are subject to changes in the cost of the petrochemicals produced by the major chemical companies 
these costs are outside of the company s control and the business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  such business cycles may reflect cycles and prices in the petroleum industry  which also affect the company s oilfield services business segment and may make the company  as a whole  vulnerable to the effect of changes in the petroleum industry 
the operations of the company s oilfield services and specialty petrochemical processing businesses are dependent to a certain degree upon proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets either developed by the company or licensed to it by third parties 
in many cases  these or equivalent processes or technologies are available to the company s competitors  customers and others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such persons will not develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary processes and technologies 
the availability to  or development by others of equivalent or superior information  processes or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company entered the specialty petrochemical processing industry with its acquisition of wedco in april  and had no experience in the industry prior to the acquisition 
since the acquisition of wedco  the company has expanded its specialty petrochemical processing business with the acquisitions of psi and bayshore in july and december  respectively  the rotec and micropowders business acquisitions in april  the micronyl acquisition in may  the verplast acquisition in july  the jr courtenay nz ltd 
jrc and soreco acquisitions in march and june  respectively  of fiscal year the success of the company will depend  in part  on the company s ability to integrate the operations of these specialty petrochemical processing companies by  among other things  centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation among the businesses and the sharing of resources 
in addition  the recent growth of the company will place significant demands on the company s management  internal systems and networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage or implement its plans for these operations or that  if implemented  such plans will be successful 
in addition  in fiscal year  the company began to expand the distribution aspects of its specialty petrochemical production services business through the acquisition of the micropowders business  the execution of supply agreements with borealis and exxon chemical holland and the acquisitions of rotec  verplast  and jrc 
each of these operations  as well as the bayshore operation  requires the company to buy and manage inventories of supplies and products in the specialty petrochemical processing business 
the company s entry into the distribution portion of this business requires the company to maintain greater levels of working capital than it has historically and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values 
the maintenance of excessive inventories in these businesses could expose the company to losses from drops in market prices for its products while maintenance of insufficient inventories may result in lost sales to the company 
a portion of the company s current operations are conducted in international markets  particularly the company s western european and southeast asian specialty petrochemical processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations through internal growth and acquisitions 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including  among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets
