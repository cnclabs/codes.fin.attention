in addition  gaming statutes and license requirements in the jurisdictions in which the company s subsidiaries currently operate or may operate in the future may require the maintenance of minimum amounts of statutory capital and place certain restrictions upon the amount of dividends that the company s subsidiaries may pay 
the success of the company will be dependent  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
revenue from the on line lottery segment consists primarily of a contractual percentage of lottery ticket sales in states in which the company operated as well as revenue from on line lottery equipment sales and software license fees 
the segment revenue will experience fluctuations depending on contract start and end dates and relative sizes of jackpots and the number of terminals on line and selling tickets in the states in which the company operates

on line lottery revenue is generated by the company s awi subsidiary 
revenue from the gaming machine and route operations segment consists of sales and lease of gaming machines  sales of parts  central control system hardware and software  service of terminals  license fees  and from the operation of gaming machine routes 
route operations revenue consists primarily of gaming machine wagers net of pay outs to patrons and state gaming taxes 
revenue from gaming machine sales is subject to potentially significant fluctuations 
when and if new jurisdictions approve legislation for new or expanded gaming operations or when the company first enters a new jurisdiction  and if the company is awarded a contract in any such jurisdictions  the segment may experience a surge in sales revenue that may or may not subsequently decline dramatically depending on the jurisdiction and gaming venue 
the company expects gaming machine and route operations revenue to continue to be a major component of total revenues 
gaming machine revenue is primarily generated by the company s vlc subsidiary 
the company is actively seeking to expand its video and on line lottery and gaming operations into jurisdictions that have legalized gaming 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to identify or capitalize on any opportunities in suitable markets 
the company s ability to expand will be dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  including negotiating acceptable terms  securing required state  foreign  and local licenses  permits  and approvals  securing adequate financing on acceptable terms  voter and other political approvals  demographic trends  and consumers gaming preferences 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop new markets for its products 
see business contracts 
in addition  the company may incur costs in connection with pursuing new video and on line lottery and gaming opportunities that it cannot recover and may be required to expense certain of these costs  which may negatively affect the company s reported operating performance for the periods during which such costs are expensed 
revenue from wagering systems and racetrack operations is generated primarily from a contractual percentage of handle processed through computerized pari mutuel wagering systems from over contracts in north america  international sales and lease of pari mutuel wagering systems  and ownership and operation of a racetrack in sunland park  new mexico 
while on track attendance and handle from pari mutuel wagering in the united states has markedly decreased over the last decade as jurisdictions have legalized other forms of gaming  there has also been a substantial increase in simulcast and off track wagering handle during the same period 
due to the significant increase of alternate forms of gaming during the last several years  there can be no assurance that such historical patterns will remain the same in the future  nor can the company predict the magnitude of any resulting net economic effects on this segment of its business 
the company expects wagering systems and racetrack operations revenue to be a significant component of total revenues 
gross profit for each segment is herein defined as revenues for that segment less the corresponding costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and any special or other charges

such other charges are considered special and unusual in nature and are not associated with the revenue stream of any segment of the company s operations 
accordingly  the company believes that the inclusion of such other charges in the determination of gross profit would not be indicative of past  current or future gross profit margins

both contracts terminated in the company expects the on line lottery segment to remain a significant segment of the company  and the segment s growth is dependent upon management s strategy to selectively bid on domestic lottery contracts and continue to pursue international on line lottery opportunities 
on line lottery contracts for twelve state lotteries will be up for procurement over the next three years two of which are the company s 
due to the high cost of procuring new lottery contracts  the company intends to target those states which it believes will establish a bidding process based exclusively on technical capability  price and service
