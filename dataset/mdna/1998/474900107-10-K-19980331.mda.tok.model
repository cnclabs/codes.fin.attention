item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the principal business of the company consists of soliciting deposits from the general public through its branches and investing these funds primarily in loans secured by single family residential properties located in the company s market areas 
the company also originates residential construction loans and loans secured by commercial real estate as well as a limited amount of consumer loans 
the company additionally maintains substantial portfolios of investment and mortgage backed securities 
the company s net income is dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment securities portfolios  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net income is also affected by the generation of noninterest income  such as deposit account service charges  fees  and gains on the sale of loans 
also  net income is affected by the level of loan loss provisions and operating expenses 
the operations of the company  and the thrift industry  are significantly impacted by competition  prevailing economic conditions  and current monetary and financial policies 
lending activities are influenced by the supply and demand for housing  availability of funds  interest rate levels  and competition 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing interest rates  competitive investments  certificate of deposit maturities and personal income and savings levels in the market area 
forward looking statements when used in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made  and to advise readers that various factors  including regional and national economic conditions  unfavorable judicial decisions  substantial changes in levels of market interest rates  credit and other risks of lending and investment activities and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
the company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
interest rate risk sensitivity the primary component of the company s net income is derived from the spread between interest earning asset yields and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in a changing interest rate environment this spread can widen or narrow depending on the relative repricing and maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a principal strategy of the company has been to achieve acceptable net interest margins while decreasing the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rate fluctuations by matching more closely the cash flows and effective maturities or repricings of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
in implementing this strategy  the company has sought to increase the sensitivity of its assets to changing interest rates by emphasizing the origination and or purchase of adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with shorter terms and or adjustable rates 
the company also originates fixed rate mortgage loans which are generally sold in the secondary market 
the company actively manages the maturity and repricing characteristics of its liabilities and has sought to limit the interest sensitivity of its liabilities by emphasizing certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or longer 
the company has utilized short term borrowings from federal home loan banks to fund loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or balloon features 
interest rate risk at a given point in time can be represented by an interest rate sensitivity position gap 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which mature or reprice in each of the time periods shown 
the table projects principal prepayments for loans receivable using the historical prepayment rates for pools of similar loans and for mortgage backed securities using the historical prepayment rate for each individual security 
all other information is based on contractual terms to maturity or repricing 
this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
more than more than three months one year three months through through more than or less one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable      mortgage backed securities     investment securities and other interest earning assets     total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings deposits      borrowed money     total interest bearing liabilities 
     interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     ratio of cumulative gap to total assets a static gap report consists of an inventory of the dollar amounts of assets and liabilities that have the potential to mature or reprice within a particular period 
it does not consider the probability that potential maturities or repricings of interest sensitive accounts will occur  or to what extent 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in the company s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the ots also produces a similar analysis using its own model based upon data submitted on the quarterly thrift financial reports filed by the subsidiary thrifts 
the results of the ots model may vary from the company s internal model due to differences in assumptions utilized  including loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposits decay rates 
the following table sets forth the company s npv as of december  npv as of net portfolio value portfolio value of assets change in interest rates dollar percent npv change in in basis points rate shock amount change change ratio basis points dollars in thousands static 
 as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s npv and will differ from actual results 
income simulation analysis captures the potential and probability of the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities 
moreover  income simulation analysis measures the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
also  income simulation analysis permits management to assess the probable effects on balance sheet items of interest rate changes and management strategies that address such changes 
for these reasons  the company relies primarily upon income simulation analysis in measuring and managing exposure to interest rate risk 
average balance  interest and average yields and costs the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities including the average yield on such assets and the average cost of such liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average month end balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods indicated 
during the periods indicated  nonaccrual loans are included in loans receivable 
the table also presents information for the periods indicated with respect to the company s net interest margin which has traditionally been used by financial institutions as an indicator of the profitability of their core operations 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by the average balance of interest earning assets and is a function of the company s interest rate spread the difference between the weighted average yield on its interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the ratio of its average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

first federal agreed that it would take corrective actions with respect to certain matters primarily related to the bank s lending and asset classification functions 
first federal also agreed to curtail loans for acquisition and development purposes without prior ots approval and to restrict the amount of residential construction loans it may make to any one borrower 
during the course of the examination and in its formal examination response to the ots  first federal advised the ots that it had already taken  or committed to take  substantially all of the actions required by the agreement  including internally imposed restrictions on the bank s lending activities that are more stringent than those called for by the agreement

the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the company s interest rate spread increased from during to during the improvements in the average balance of interest earning assets and the interest rate spread were primarily the result of growth in the average balance of loans receivable caused by the acquisitions of texas heritage and l b financial and continued strong loan origination activity 
also contributing to the improvement in net interest income has been a continued expansion in the net interest margin which the company attributes to several factors including the sale of lower yielding mortgage backed securities during the third quarter of  which provided the company with funding for additional loan originations in the texas market  and the upward adjustment of rates on the company s existing adjustable rate loan portfolio 
another significant contributor to the increase in loan portfolio yields during recent periods has been the company s construction and development lending through its texas subsidiary 
in order to improve the risk profile of the texas subsidiary  however  the company has previously determined to reduce its level of higher margin development lending in texas 
first federal has also agreed with the ots to curtail loans for acquisition and development purposes without prior ots approval and to restrict the amount of residential construction loans which it may make to one borrower 
in addition  the company currently does not anticipate making additional acquisitions in the texas market 
as a result of these developments  the company s net interest income may not experience increases in future periods comparable to those experienced during the past several years 
interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income increased from to million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from the increase in the average volume of interest earning assets caused by the acquisitions of texas heritage and l b financial and continued strong loan origination activity

net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   as a result of growth in the company s interest earning assets and significant improvement in the company s interest rate spread 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the company s interest rate spread increased from during to during the improvements in the average balance of interest earning assets and the interest rate spread were primarily the result of the increased loan origination activity in texas and the inclusion of the operating results of first federal for the entire year 
interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in the average volume of interest earning assets resulting from the inclusion of a full year of first federal s results of operations and strong loan origination activity in texas 
these factors  combined with the shift in interest earning assets from mortgage backed securities to higher yielding loans  led to an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest income on loans receivable increased million  or 
the increase in interest income from loans receivable is attributable to an increase in the average yield on the loan portfolio from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  and a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable during the year ended december  the increase in the average yield on the loan portfolio is due to the upward adjustment on the company s adjustable rate loan portfolio and increased construction lending  primarily in the company s texas market  which is at higher yields than the existing loan portfolio

interest income from other interest earning assets including interest earned on interest bearing deposits in the fhlb and dividends received on the fhlb stock which jefferson savings and first federal are required to hold as members of the fiilb decreased  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on other interest earning assets from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
total interest expense increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to an increase in interest expense on savings deposits which was mostly offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowed money 
interest expense on savings deposits increased million from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million for the twelve month period ended december  primarily as the result of a million increase in the average balance of savings deposits due to the inclusion of the deposits from the texas acquisitions in the average balance for the full year during versus a partial year since their dates of acquisition in the average cost of deposits decreased from during to during due to the decrease in market interest rates between the respective periods 
interest expense on borrowed money decreased million from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million for the twelve month period ended december  primarily due to a million decrease in the average balance

for many years  software applications routinely conserved magnetic storage space by using only two digits to record calendar years  for example  the year is stored as 
on january   the calendars in many software applications will change from to 
many of these software applications  in their current form  will produce erroneous results or will fail to run at all since their logic cannot deal with this transaction 
the company s mainframe computer hardware and systems software are year compliant 
the company primarily utilizes third party vendor application software for all computer applications 
the third party vendors for the company s banking applications are in the process of modifying  upgrading or replacing their computer applications to ensure year compliance

under such program  the company will examine the need for modifications or replacement of all non year compliant software 
the company does not currently expect that the cost of its year compliance program will be material to its financial condition and believes that it will satisfy such compliance program by the end of without material disruption of its operations 
in the event that the company s significant suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business of operations could be adversely affected

as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
