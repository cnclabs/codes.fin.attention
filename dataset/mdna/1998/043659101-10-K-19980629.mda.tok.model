item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in net sales resulted from a increase in units shipped during fiscal compared to fiscal offset in part by a decrease in average selling price of equipment resulting from large quantity order discounts earned by customers during fiscal although unit sales increased in each of the first three quarters of fiscal from the previous quarter  unit sales declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal as a result of a drop in the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor capital equipment experienced in the fourth quarter 
international sales declined to of net sales in fiscal compared to of sales in the prior fiscal year 
international sales  which represented approximately of sales through the third quarter of fiscal  decreased substantially to of sales in the fourth quarter as orders from countries in the far east slowed 
as noted above  the company began experiencing declining bookings and  as a result  lower net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of adverse market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
the company expects that such market conditions will continue into the foreseeable future and as a result  will unfavorably impact bookings and net sales levels for some period of time 
see liquidity and capital resources gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal fiscal gross profit was impacted by a special charge  recorded in the fourth quarter  of million  or of net sales  resulting from valuation adjustments for vt inventory being carried in excess of normal replacement cost  and to a lesser extent  the discontinuation of certain product lines 
excluding the special charge  fiscal gross profit was million  or of net sales  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year gross profit margin percentage 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was a result of higher than normal discount rates earned by customers on larger quantity orders shipped during fiscal  a shift in product mix away from older product lines with higher gross margins and manufacturing excess capacity experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development costs increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development costs were of net sales in both fiscal years 
the increase in such spending resulted from the addition of wed in the first quarter of fiscal see note l to the consolidated financial statements  and the hiring of additional engineering personnel and procurement of prototype material for continuing development projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were affected by a special charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal components of the special charge were  related to the writedown of certain intangible assets associated with the acquisition of wed  as discussed below  and approximately  related to costs associated with the layoff of employees 
excluding the special charge  selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal was million or of net sales 
the balance of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was a result of the addition of wed in the first quarter of fiscal  increased promotional and trade show costs related to the vt introduction  increased costs of travel  an increase to the bad debt reserve to cover potential exposure in accounts receivable on far east shipments and costs related to the establishment of a new sales and service office in singapore 
the company s initial allocation of purchase price at the date of its acquisition of wed resulted in an estimate of acquired in process research and development of million  and developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles totaling million 
however  during  the company determined that certain acquired technology was not as developed as originally expected  and certain in process technology would require more time to develop than originally anticipated 
at the end of fiscal  the company completed the allocation of the purchase price and estimated the fair values of the acquired in process research and development  developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles using estimated future discounted cash flows 
the final allocation resulted in an additional in process research and development charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter  resulting in an aggregate year to date charge of million 
the acquired in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the company estimates that million will be expensed over the next three years in connection with the completion of acquired research and development 
since wed incurred operating losses in fiscal which were not originally anticipated  the year end assessments for developed technology and related goodwill indicated that the amounts originally recorded for these assets would not be recovered and thus were impaired 
therefore  these assets were written down to their estimated fair values  resulting in a separate fourth quarter charge of  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statement of operations 
as a result of the above  the company generated an operating loss of million for fiscal including million of fiscal special charges compared to operating income of million for fiscal other income  net consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents which decreased in fiscal because of the lower average cash balance maintained during the year after the acquisition of wed 
the company recorded a tax benefit of  in fiscal compared to a tax provision of million in fiscal the company s tax rate was affected by the inability to offset losses incurred by wed against income earned in the united states and the write off of acquired in process research and development and goodwill associated with the acquisition of wed  both of which are not deductible for tax purposes 
furthermore  the company recorded a valuation allowance principally representing net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets at wed which the company does not deem the realization of these assets to be more likely than not 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income for fiscal of million  or 
per diluted share 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in unit shipments due to an industry wide slowdown in the semiconductor market during fiscal international sales  which increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal  represented approximately of net sales in fiscal versus in fiscal sales in the pacific rim region were particularly strong  representing of all international sales 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from a reduction in manufacturing overhead spending which was disproportionate with the reduction in units produced during fiscal although cost control measures  including a reduction in workforce and discretionary spending constraints  were made early in fiscal  the savings realized were partially offset by spending on operation infrastructure enhancements incurred to enable the company to respond effectively to production demands in the future 
research and development costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
research and development spending in fiscal focused primarily on the development of a new test handler system design and the enhancement of existing products through additional automation and product versatility through additional conversion kits 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased approximately to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative costs were and during fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from a decrease in sales commissions earned during the year 
the decrease in commission expense resulted from both the decrease in net sales and a decrease in commission rates resulting from the company s efforts to transition more customers to a direct sales relationship 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs were partially offset by spending incurred to support the installation of the company s new business information system 
as a result of the above  operating income for fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal other income  net of  in fiscal and  in fiscal was derived primarily from interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the fiscal tax rate was lower than the fiscal rate principally because of a higher percentage of net sales coming from international markets and a greater r d tax credit which resulted as the company accelerated its spending on certain qualified development expenses 
net income for fiscal decreased to million  or 
per share with  weighted average shares outstanding  from million  or per share with  weighted average shares outstanding  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal additionally  the company had an unsecured line of credit with a bank in the amount of million against which there were no borrowings at the end of fiscal the company s largest single use of cash during the year was for the purchase of its wafer automation equipment subsidiary  wed  for approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal see note l to the consolidated financial statements 
the company used approximately million in cash for operating activities during fiscal the primary working capital factors affecting cash from operations were inventory levels  accounts receivable  and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
during fiscal  inventory levels increased by approximately million  offset by a fourth quarter fiscal special charge of million related to lower of cost or market issues with vt inventory and the discontinuation of certain products 
the increase in inventory resulted from the addition of wed in the first quarter of fiscal  the receipt of inventory for the initial quantity build of the vt and an increase in finished units built in anticipation of receipt of machine orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal which did not book 
accounts receivable were relatively comparable with the prior year despite the increase in net sales in fiscal versus fiscal  driving days sales in accounts receivable down to days at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal accounts payable and accrued expenses increased during the fiscal year as a result of the increase in business volume in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the first quarter addition of wed 
the company used approximately million in cash during fiscal to fund the acquisition of capital equipment which included a new enterprise wide management information system and additions of equipment used in the manufacturing and engineering areas and internal software development costs 
the company generated cash from financing activities in fiscal of approximately  from employee stock purchases under the company s employee stock option and stock purchase plans and used approximately  to pay down a line of credit which the company assumed with the purchase of wed 
the company expects to continue to experience a slowdown in the volume of business due to adverse market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
however  the company intends to reduce further its expenses to a level consistent with its projected lower net sales 
although the company anticipates that it will incur losses in future quarters which will negatively impact its liquidity position  the company believes that funds generated from operations  existing cash balances and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
under this standard  certain revenues  expenses  gains and losses recognized during the period are included in comprehensive income  regardless of whether they are considered to be results of operations of the period 
sfas  which becomes effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal  is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
presently  the only additional item to be included in comprehensive income is the company s cumulative translation adjustment 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which establishes standards for the way that public companies report selected information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those companies report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this statement becomes effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal the company is in the process of assessing the impact of sfas on its footnote disclosures 
year compliance historically certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in a computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem 
the company is in the process of implementing a new enterprise wide management information system that the vendor has represented is year compliant 
in addition  the company has completed an initial assessment of other software used by the company for year compliance 
the company also reviews each of its new hardware and software purchases to ensure that they are year compliant 
based on the foregoing  the company believes that the computer systems used by it are year compliant or will become year compliant without materially and adversely affecting the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially and adversely affected by the failure of its significant vendors or customers to successfully and timely achieve year compliance with respect to their own computer systems 
the impact of inflation on the company s business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
cautionary statement for purposes of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of the company  including but not limited to statements contained in item business  item properties and item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
readers are cautioned that such statements  which maybe identified by words including anticipates  believes  intends  estimates  plans  and other similar expressions  are only predictions or estimations and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  over which the company has little or no control 
in evaluating such statements  readers should consider the various factors identified below which could cause actual events  performance or results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements 
semiconductor market fluctuations the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times  which often have a disproportionate effect on manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future quarterly or annual operating results as a result of such a market fluctuation 
the semiconductor industry in recent periods has experienced decreased demand  and it is uncertain how long these conditions will continue 
integration of wed in may the company acquired wed  a maker of integrated circuit wafer handling and inspection systems 
the process of integrating wed s business into the company has and may continue to result in ongoing and extraordinary operating difficulties and expenditures  has and may continue to absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of the company s business and has and may continue to result in charges to operating results 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in the fact that prior to the acquisition of wed  the company had limited direct experience with the market for integrated circuit wafer handling and inspection systems 
variability in quarterly operating results during each quarter  the company customarily sells a limited number of systems  thus a change in the shipment of a few systems in a quarter can have a significant impact on results of operations for a particular quarter 
to achieve sales objectives  the company must generally obtain orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is obtained 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments with limited or no penalty  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  the company s operating results are subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter and could be adversely affected for a particular quarter if shipments for that quarter were lower than anticipated 
moreover  since the company ships a significant quantity of products at or near the end of each quarter  the magnitude of fluctuation is not known until late in or at the end of any given quarter 
new product introductions the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products including  in particular  continued iterations of its newest belt conveyance test handler  in a timely manner or that such products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
additionally there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manufacture such products at profitable levels or in sufficient quantities to meet customer requirements 
the inability of the company to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
international operations in fiscal  of the company s net sales were derived from customers in international markets 
the company is therefore subject to certain risks common to many export activities  such as governmental regulations  export license requirements  air transportation disruptions  freight rates and the risk of imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers 
a portion of the company s international sales are invoiced in foreign currencies and  accordingly  are subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates 
as such there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its position by hedging its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive 
the company s competitors include a number of established companies that have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company also competes with a number of smaller companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition or that the competitive pressures faced by the company will not adversely effect its profitability or financial performance 
customer concentrations although the company has a growing customer base  from time to time  an individual customer may account for or more of the company s quarterly or annual net sales 
during the year ended march   two customers accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
the company expects that such customer concentration of net sales will continue to occur from time to time as customers place large quantity orders with the company 
as a result  the loss of  or significant reduction in purchases by  any such customer could have an adverse effect on the company s annual or quarterly financial results 
investments in research development and selling general administrative expenses the company is currently investing in specific time sensitive strategic programs related to both the research and development and selling  general and administrative areas which the company believes are critical to its future ability to compete effectively in the market 
as such the company plans to continue to invest in such programs at a planned rate and not to reduce or limit the increase in such expenditures until such programs are completed 
as a result there can be no assurance that such expenditures will not adversely affect the company s quarterly or annual profitability or financial performance 
reliance on third party distribution channels the company markets and sells its products primarily through third party manufacturers representative organizations which are not under the direct control of the company 
the company has limited internal sales personnel 
a reduction in the sales efforts by the company s current manufacturers representatives or a termination of their relationships with the company could adversely affect the company s operations and financial performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its current manufacturers representatives or its distribution channels by selling directly through its sales employees or enter into arrangements with new manufacturers representatives 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of senior management and technical personnel 
these persons are not bound by employment agreements 
the loss of the services of a number of these key persons could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the company s industry is intense 
although the company has been successful to date in this endeavor  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to successfully develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 
dependence on proprietary technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software and hardware which the company protects primarily through patents and restrictions on access to its trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others  the use of patents to protect software and hardware has increased and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future
