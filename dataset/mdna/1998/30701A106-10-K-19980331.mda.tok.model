accordingly  the company has satisfied its capital needs primarily through debt and equity financings 
the company s outstanding indebtedness as of december  of million bears interest at fixed and variable rates currently ranging from to 
during the year ended december   the company issued  aggregate principal amount of notes 
the notes mature on october  and bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually on april and october of each year commencing april  the notes are unsecured and subordinate to all present and future senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture of the company 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  initially at of the principal amount thereof and thereafter at prices declining to at october   together with accrued and unpaid interest  except that no redemption may be made prior to october  upon a change of control as defined in the indenture  each holder of notes shall have the right  at the holder s option  to require the company to repurchase such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date as defined in the indenture  if any 
the net proceeds of the offering are being used i to repay existing indebtedness of the company  ii to fund certain capital expenditures and iii for general corporate purposes  including future acquisitions and working capital 
as of december  the company had no borrowings under its line of credit the credit facility with the chase manhattan bank chase 
on june  the company entered into a two year million secured revolving credit facility  converting to a four year term loan at the end of the first two years 
after conversion to the term loan  the loan is to be paid off in substantially equal quarterly installments 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by the pledge of the stock of most of the company s subsidiaries and such subsidiaries have also guaranteed such obligations 
at the time of each loan under the credit facility  the company may choose between an interest rate based on i the greater of chase s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum the base rate plus per annum or ii the london interbank offered rate libor  plus between and per annum depending on the company s ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda as such terms are defined in the credit facility 
during the term loan  the interest rate will be increased by per annum in the case of base rate loans and per annum in the case of libor loans 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including  among others  covenants limiting liens  indebtedness  acquisitions  asset sales and investments and covenants requiring continued compliance with certain financial tests  including  among others  a net worth test and several financial ratios 
the company may pay dividends as long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
included among the events of default are any change of control of the company or if dominic chang should cease to be the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer or cease to own at least of the company s common stock 
in connection with the acquisition of lci  the company incurred term debt the term debt to refinance lci s existing indebtedness 
the principal amount of the term debt million is being paid in monthly installments through august the company has the same interest rate choices as it does with respect to the term debt under the credit facility and is subject to the same operational financial requirements 
the indebtedness is secured by a mortgage lien upon the three parcels of real property leased by lci 
the balance of the company s outstanding debt of million aggregate principal amount as of december  is represented by a variety of different debt instruments bearing interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to and includes a loan in the principal amount of million made by orix usa corporation orix in may  which matures in may and bears interest at libor plus per annum  a mortgage payable in the principal amount of million  bearing interest at and matures in march  a small business term loan in the principal amount of 
million  bearing interest at per annum and payable in monthly installments through august  a promissory note in the principal amount of million  bearing interest at per annum and which was subsequently paid on january  and a mortgage payable in the principal amount of million  bearing interest at payable in monthly installments through november the company anticipates making substantial additional expenditures in connection with the acquisition and operation of new facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities 
facility opening expenditures primarily relate to projected facility construction and opening costs  associated marketing activities and the addition of personnel 
in many cases  the company acquires  rather than leases  the land on which its facilities are located  which entails additional expenditures 
based on the company s experience with its existing golf centers  the company believes that the cost of opening or acquiring a golf center generally ranges from approximately million to million exclusive of land costs 
the company also intends to acquire or construct additional ice rink facilities and family sports supercenters which  on a per facility basis  are expected to cost more than the company s golf centers 
the company believes that the cost of opening or acquiring ice rink facilities will range from approximately million to million 
the company currently plans to spend an aggregate million over the next eight months to convert one of its existing golf centers to a family sports supercenter and to construct one additional family sports supercenter 
however  there can be no assurance that facility opening or acquisition costs will not exceed the amounts estimated above 
facility opening and acquisition costs vary substantially depending on the location and status of the acquired property ie whether significant improvements are necessary and whether the company acquires or leases the related land 
land acquisition costs vary substantially depending on a number of factors  including principally location 
to the extent that the company acquires any golf courses  the company may be required to make capital improvements to these courses  depending upon the location and status of the acquired property 
the cost of facility acquisition depends  to a large extent  upon the price of the land and may substantially exceed the anticipated cost of facility acquisitions 
effect of recently acquired facilities on a pro forma basis  after giving effect to material acquisitions consummated after january  as if they had occurred as of january   the company had net income of million as compared to net income of million on a historical basis  for the twelve months ended december   and net income of million as compared to net income of million on a historical basis  for the year ended december  although newly acquired facilities have adversely affected income on a pro forma basis in the past and may adversely affect income on a pro forma basis in the future  the company believes that it will be able to enhance the performance of such facilities by adding amenities and other improvements and centralizing key functions as described in business business strategy 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to improve the performance of newly acquired facilities 
seasonality historically  the second and third quarters have accounted for a greater portion of the company s operating income than have the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this is primarily due to an outdoor playing season limited by inclement weather 
although most of the company s facilities are designed to be all weather  portions of the facilities  such as miniature golf courses which are outdoors  tend to be vulnerable to weather conditions 
one of the company s golf centers and one golf course are closed during a portion of the winter 
also  golfers are less inclined to practice when weather conditions limit their ability to play golf on outdoor courses 
since august  the company has acquired golf centers in various locations arizona  california  virginia  georgia  south carolina and florida where inclement weather may not limit the outdoor playing season as much as such weather limits the outdoor playing season at the company s golf facilities in northern states 
in addition  the ice rink facilities and the family sports supercenters are expected to generate a substantial portion of the revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year and accordingly  may partially offset such seasonality 
the timing of new facility acquisitions and openings may cause the company s results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
inflation there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation during  or year issues certain of the company s computer systems and software interpret the year as the year or some other date 
the operating system generally employed by the company is windows  which is year compliant 
the networking  general ledger and accounts payable and facility point of sale and pro shop software programs require software updates or modifications to address the year problem 
dms  inc  which provides certain of the company s software and systems under contract  particularly the general ledger and accounts payable software programs  will be installing modifications to address the year issue at no charge to the company 
the company is further addressing the matter by replacing certain older computers and installing off the shelf and other third party software that is year compliant  at an estimated cost of less than  the company anticipates that installation of year compliant software and hardware will be completed by the end of the company does not believe that the year problem will have a material affect on the company s operations  however  no assurance can be given that the software updates and new computers will resolve the problem as scheduled or at all
