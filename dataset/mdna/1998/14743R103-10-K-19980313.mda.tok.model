outlook case continues to benefit from strong worldwide markets for its agricultural and construction equipment and financial services businesses 
while economic conditions are favorable in most of case s major markets  recent changes in certain regions of the world have increased the risk of lower product demand 
grain stock levels around the world remained at the low range of normal levels as continued strong demand for agricultural commodities kept pace with good harvests 
this demand for farm products is expected to be sustained by continued population growth and improving diets within developing nations  although near term  the export market could be impacted by economic conditions 
in north america  the harvest was exceptionally strong in beans and corn  and commodity prices have remained solid 
as a result  net farm income remained at high levels 
the outlook in europe is also favorable  except in the united kingdom  where currency rates resulted in lower farm subsidy payments 
in the asia pacific region  the growing season could be affected by uncertain weather conditions 
and  in latin america  planting is expected to be at historically strong levels  which should fuel continued growth in the agricultural equipment business there  particularly in the higher horsepower categories 
in case s construction equipment market  the outlook varies by both country and economic conditions 
in north america  housing starts continued at strong levels through the end of  sustained by favorable interest rates 
in europe  the construction equipment markets in france and germany remain competitive as the economies have yet to fully recover 
and  in the united kingdom  the housing market continued strong through year end  although the rate of growth is expected to slow somewhat 
in the asia pacific region  the australian housing market showed further signs of recovery  and the direct impact to case of economic conditions in southeast asia to date  remains minimal 
in latin america  the markets in mexico continue to be strong and  in brazil  higher interest rates could impact the market in  but construction activity remained solid through the end of the information included in the outlook section represents forward looking statements and involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
the company s outlook is predominantly based on its interpretation of what it considers key economic assumptions 
crop production and commodity prices are strongly affected by weather and can fluctuate significantly 
housing starts and other construction activity are sensitive to interest rates and government spending 
some of the other significant factors for the company include general economic and capital market conditions  the cyclical nature of its business  foreign currency movements  the company s access to credit  political uncertainty and civil unrest in various areas of the world  pricing  product initiatives and other actions taken by competitors  disruptions in production capacity  excess inventory levels  the effect of changes in laws and regulations including government subsidies and international trade regulations  changes in environmental laws  and employee relations 
further information concerning factors that could significantly impact expected results is included in the following sections of this form k business employees  business environmental matters  business significant international operations  business seasonality and production schedules  business competition  legal proceedings  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality and production schedules the seasonality of farm equipment retail sales is directly affected by the timing of major crop activities tilling  planting and harvesting 
the timing of these activities is impacted by crop production and climate conditions 
the fourth quarter is generally the strongest demand period for retail farm equipment sales  normally representing approximately of sales by case s north american dealers 
the weakest retail demand for case farm equipment in north america typically occurs in the first quarter  accounting for approximately to of sales by case s north american dealers 
seasonal demand fluctuations for construction equipment are less significant than those for farm equipment 
nevertheless  in north america  housing construction slows down  especially in the midwest and on the east coast  beginning in november and continuing through the first quarter 
north american retail demand for case s construction equipment is strongest in the second and fourth quarters  which combined represent approximately to of sales by case s north american dealers 
european demand patterns are similar to those in the united states 
sales to independent dealers closely correspond with case s production levels  which are based upon its estimates of the demand for its products  taking into account the timing of dealer shipments which are in advance of retail demand  dealer inventory levels  the need to shut down production to enable manufacturing facilities to be prepared for the manufacture of new or different models and the efficient use of manpower and facilities 
the production levels are adjusted to reflect changes in estimated demand  dealer inventory levels  labor disruptions and other matters not within case s control 
inflation inflation impacts the company s business in both the costs of production and the demand for its products 
a significant portion of the cost of case machinery is comprised of material costs 
therefore  material price inflation could result in increased manufacturing costs through supplier price increases to case 
case s ability to recover increased supplier costs would be dependent  in part  on its competitors responses to these economic conditions 
manufacturing cost increases in excess of increased pricing in the market could have an adverse effect on case 
increases in inflation tend to cause higher interest rates 
the demand for farm and  to a greater extent  construction equipment  is negatively impacted by high interest rates 
as interest rates on farm debt escalate  farmers tend to delay equipment purchases 
case s construction equipment business is heavily tied to the housing construction sector  and in the face of rising mortgage rates  potential homeowners tend to delay purchases 
increases in the level of worldwide inflation could have a negative effect on the level of demand for farm and construction equipment 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to stringent environmental regulation by governmental authorities 
although the company has a program designed to implement environmental management practices and compliance and has reserved for environmental liabilities  it is possible that developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from the company s operations  could result in future costs and liabilities that may exceed the range currently anticipated by the company 
as it has done in the past  the company intends to fund its cost of environmental compliance from operating cash flows 
also see note to the case financial statements included in item hereof 
foreign currency risk management the company has significant international manufacturing operations 
in most instances  case s products and components are only produced at a single manufacturing facility 
as a result  significant volumes of finished goods and components are exported to other countries for sale into those markets 
in addition  the company buys finished products from germany  italy and japan for sale through its distribution network 
for goods purchased from other case affiliates  the company denominates the transaction in the functional currency of the producing operation 
large volume purchase agreements for products purchased from third parties normally contain currency risk sharing clauses that limit the amount of exposure from currency fluctuations 
the company has adopted the following guidelines to manage its foreign exchange exposures i increase the predictability of costs associated with goods whose purchase price is not denominated in the functional currency of the buyer  ii minimize the cost of hedging through use of naturally offsetting positions  and iii where possible  sell product in the functional currency of the producing operation 
the company s identifiable foreign exchange exposures result primarily from the anticipated purchase of equipment and components from case affiliates and third party suppliers along with the repayment of intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company identifies naturally occurring offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
for further information regarding case s foreign currency risk management  see note to the case financial statements included in item hereof 
in  the securities and exchange commission broadened its disclosure requirements relative to derivatives and other financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company to manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposures 
case does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency the following foreign currency exchange contracts were held by the company to hedge certain currency exposures 
all contracts mature in the notional amounts and fair values at december   are as follows us dollars  in millions december  notional average fair value amount contract rate gains losses foreign currency forward exchange contracts austrian shilling australian dollar belgian franc canadian dollar german mark danish krone spanish peseta french franc british pound sterling italian lira  japanese yen purchased currency options australian dollar sold currency options australian dollar per us dollar interest rates the company has implemented an interest rate risk management program with respect to a portion of the credit facilities  which carry a floating rate of interest 
the program is within guidelines of the policies approved by the board of directors to limit exposure to rising interest rates 
the exact nature  timing and size of the program is based upon the amount of debt in case industrial and the credit companies 
for further information regarding case s interest rate risk management  see note to the case financial statements included in item hereof 
at december   the company performed a sensitivity analysis for the company s derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
the company calculated the pretax earnings effect on its interest sensitive instruments  including accounts and notes receivable and fixed rate  long term debt obligations 
based on this sensitivity analysis  the company has determined that an increase of in the company s weighted average interest rates at december   would have no material impact on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
