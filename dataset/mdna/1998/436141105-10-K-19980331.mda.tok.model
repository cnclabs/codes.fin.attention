since a portion of store level operating expenses is fixed  new stores generally have lower operating margins in the first year of operation 
in addition  pre opening expenses are charged to earnings in the first full month of a store s operation 
therefore  the addition of a significant number of new stores to the company s existing store base has and will continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operating margin

liquidity and capital resources the company generates substantial operating cash flow because most of its revenue is received in cash 
the amount of cash generated from operations in significantly exceeded the current debt service requirements of the company s long term obligations 
the capital expenditures including purchases of videocassette rental inventory of the company are primarily funded by the excess operating cash flow and from the proceeds from the debt recapitalization see cash provided by financing activities 
in addition  the company has a million revolving line of credit available to address the timing of certain working capital and capital expenditure disbursements 
the company believes cash flow from operations  supplemented by the availability of a revolving line of credit  will provide the company with adequate liquidity and the capital necessary to achieve its planned expansion through at least at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million 
videocassette rental inventories are accounted for as noncurrent assets under generally accepted accounting principles because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of the company s revenue  the classification of these assets as noncurrent excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of videocassette rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  the company believes working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of videocassette rental inventory as a noncurrent asset  the company may  from time to time  operate with a working capital deficit 
cash provided by operating activities during  net cash generated by operations was million higher than the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue  depreciation and amortization expenses and a net favorable change in working capital accounts  partially offset by lower results of operations see results of operations and a net unfavorable change in deferred income taxes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net favorable change in working capital accounts was due to a net favorable change in accounts payable  accrued interest see cash provided by operating activities and other current assets and liabilities partially offset by a net unfavorable change in accounts receivable 
the net favorable change in other current assets and liabilities was due to costs incurred by the company in the current year with respect to the failed self tender offer see note to the consolidated financial statements and increased advertising accruals due to timing of payments 
the increase in accounts receivable in the current year was due to an increase in certain marketing allowances and ancillary rental fees attributable to an increase in the number of stores operated by the company 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by million from the prior year primarily due to increased purchases of videocassette rental inventory for new and existing stores and capital expenditures with respect to new store construction  remodeling of certain existing stores and for the continued development of information management systems see capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million from the prior year as a result of the recapitalization of the company s debt structure through the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes the notes  all of the principal of which is due august  with interest paid semiannually see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the proceeds received from the sale of the notes  net of offering costs of million  were used to repay the entire outstanding indebtedness under the then existing bank revolving loan 
the excess proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to fund capital expenditures including purchase of videocassette rental inventory in the current year 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company entered into a new senior revolving credit agreement which provides for the availability of up to million in revolving credit loans 
the company may utilize the new revolving credit facility as needed for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures include product for stores  store equipment and fixtures  remodeling a certain number of existing stores  implementing and upgrading office and store technology and opening new store locations 
each new store opening requires initial capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  inventory  equipment and costs related to site location  lease negotiations and construction permits of approximately million  excluding leasehold improvements that are customarily paid for by the property developer 
these capital expenditures will be funded primarily by cash generated from operations  supplemented by the availability of a senior revolving line of credit or other forms of equipment financing and or leasing  if necessary 
general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality the company anticipates that its business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
future operating results may be affected by various factors  including variations in the number and timing of new store openings  the performance of new or acquired stores  the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  the expense associated with the acquisition of new release titles  additional and existing competition  marketing programs  weather  special or unusual events and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
in addition  any concentration of new store openings and the related new store pre opening costs and other expenses associated with the opening of new stores near the end of a fiscal quarter could have an adverse effect on the financial results for that quarter and could  in certain circumstances  lead to fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
the video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
the company believes these seasonality trends will continue
