the company s unit sales were up on the motorized side and for towables 
the company s overall average unit selling price excluding units sold by the holiday world dealerships that were either previously owned or not holiday rambler units increased slightly from  in to  in due to the inclusion of holiday rambler s generally lower priced products and the planned introduction of new products at historically lower price points  the company expects its overall average unit selling price to remain below  gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in gross profit and gross margin were limited by a million increase in cost of sales as a result of an inventory write up to fair value arising from the holiday acquisition 
without this charge  gross profit would have been million and gross margin would have been for the company s overall gross margin may fluctuate in future periods if the mix of products shifts from higher to lower gross margin units or if the company encounters unexpected manufacturing difficulties or competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the relatively high percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales in was primarily attributable to the addition of the holiday rambler operations which have traditionally had a higher percentage than monaco

the company s overall unit sales increased almost five fold from units in to  units in excluding units sold by the holiday world dealerships that were either previously owned or not holiday rambler units 
the company s overall average unit selling price excluding units sold in by the holiday world dealerships that were either previously owned or not holiday rambler units declined from  in to  in  primarily as a result of the company selling a significantly large number of lower priced holiday rambler products  particularly towable products 
gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross profit and gross margin was limited by a million increase in cost of sales as a result of an inventory write up to fair value arising from the holiday acquisition

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in was primarily attributable to the addition of the holiday rambler operations that have traditionally had higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than monaco 
in addition  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses in were unusually low  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in part because of lower than normal incentive based compensation

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
factors that may affect future operating results potential fluctuations in operating results the company s net sales  gross margin and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as the mix of products sold  the ability to utilize and expand manufacturing resources efficiently  the introduction and consumer acceptance of new models offered by the company  competition  the addition or loss of dealers  the timing of trade shows and rallies  and factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole 
in addition  the company s overall gross margin on its products may decline in future periods to the extent the company increases its sales of lower gross margin towable products or if the mix of motor coaches shifts to lower gross margin units 
due to the relatively high selling prices of the company s products in particular  its high line class a motor coaches  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
demand in the overall recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the winter months  while sales and revenues are generally higher during the spring and summer months 
with the broader range of recreational vehicles now offered by the company as a result of the holiday acquisition  seasonal factors could have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the future 
in addition  unusually severe weather conditions in certain markets could delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another 
cyclicality the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic  demographic and political conditions that affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
unit sales of recreational vehicles excluding conversion vehicles reached a peak of approximately  units in and declined to approximately  units in although unit sales of high line class a motor coaches have increased in each year since  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
furthermore  as a result of the holiday acquisition and recent new model introductions  the company offers a much broader range of recreational vehicle products and will likely be more susceptible to recreational vehicle industry cyclicality than in the past 
factors affecting cyclicality in the recreational vehicle industry include fuel availability and fuel prices  prevailing interest rates  the level of discretionary spending  the availability of credit and overall consumer confidence 
in particular  interest rates rose significantly in and while recent interest rates have not had a material adverse effect on the company s business  no assurances can be given that an increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
management of growth as a result of the holiday acquisition and the recent expansion of its manufacturing facilities  the company has experienced significant growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its business 
this growth has resulted in the addition of new management personnel  increased responsibilities for existing management personnel  and has placed added pressure on the company s operating  financial and management information systems 
while management believes it has been successful in managing this expansion there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter problems in the future associated with the continued growth of the company 
failure to adequately support and manage the growth of its business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
manufacturing expansion the company significantly increased its manufacturing capacity in by expanding its elkhart  indiana facility and opening its coburg  oregon facility 
in  in order to meet market demand and realize manufacturing efficiencies  the company completed construction of a new motor coach manufacturing facility in wakarusa  indiana  has relocated its elkhart  indiana motor coach production to the new wakarusa facility  and has opened a springfield  oregon facility to manufacture towables 
in the first quarter of the company expects to begin a third line of production in its motorized facility in wakarusa  indiana 
by june the company expects to consolidate its existing wakarusa  indiana towable production with existing elkhart  indiana towable production 
the integration of the company s facilities and the expansion of the company s manufacturing operations involve a number of risks including unexpected production difficulties 
in  the company experienced start up inefficiencies in manufacturing the windsor model  and  beginning in  the company experienced difficulty in increasing production rates of motor coaches at its coburg facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully integrate its manufacturing facilities or that it will achieve the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from its expanded manufacturing operations 
in addition  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if sales of the company s products do not increase at a rate sufficient to offset the company s increased expense levels resulting from this expansion 
the set up of new models and scale up of production facilities in wakarusa  elkhart  and springfield involve various risks and uncertainties  including timely performance of a large number of contractors  subcontractors  suppliers and various government agencies that regulate and license construction  each of which is beyond the control of the company 
the set up of production for new models involves risks and costs associated with the development and acquisition of new production lines  molds and other machinery  the training of employees  and compliance with environmental  health and safety and other regulatory requirements 
the inability of the company to complete the scale up of its facilities and to commence full scale commercial production in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company may from time to time experience lower than anticipated yields or production constraints that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy customer orders 
any prolonged inability to satisfy customer demand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
concentration of sales to certain dealers although the company s products were offered by dealerships located primarily in the united states and canada at the end of  a significant percentage of the company s sales have been and will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of independent dealers 
although no single dealer accounted for as much as of the company s net sales in  the top two dealers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in that period 
the loss of a significant dealer or a substantial decrease in sales by such a dealer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability under repurchase agreements as is common in the recreational vehicle industry  the company enters into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by its dealers to finance their purchases 
these agreements obligate the company to repurchase a dealer s inventory under certain circumstances in the event of a default by the dealer to its lender 
if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of its products in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  business and results of operations 
the company s contingent obligations under repurchase agreements vary from period to period and totaled approximately million as of january   with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
see liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
availability and cost of fuel an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale  of diesel fuel or gasoline on a regional or national basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
diesel fuel and gasoline have  at various times in the past  been difficult to obtain  and there can be no assurance that the supply of diesel fuel or gasoline will continue uninterrupted  that rationing will not be imposed  or that the price of or tax on diesel fuel or gasoline will not significantly increase in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on certain suppliers a number of important components for certain of the company s products are purchased from single or limited sources  including its turbo diesel engines cummins  substantially all of its transmissions allison  axles for all diesel motor coaches other than the holiday rambler endeavor diesel model and chassis for certain of its holiday rambler products chevrolet  ford and freightliner 
the company has no long term supply contracts with these suppliers or their distributors 
recently  allison put all chassis manufacturers on allocation with respect to one of the transmissions the company uses 
the company believes that its allocation is sufficient to enable the unit volume increases that are planned for models using that transmission and does not foresee any operating difficulties with respect to this issue 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that allison or any of the other suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for transmissions or other key components 
an extended delay or interruption in the supply of any components obtained from a single or limited source supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
new product introductions the company believes that the introduction of new features and new models will be critical to its future success 
delays in the introduction of new models or product features or a lack of market acceptance of new models or features and or quality problems with new models or features could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  in the third quarter of the company incurred unexpected costs associated with three model changes introduced in that quarter which adversely affected the company s gross margin 
there also can be no assurance that product introductions in the future will not divert revenues from existing models and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company currently competes with a number of other manufacturers of motor coaches  fifth wheel trailers and travel trailers  some of which have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive marketing capabilities than the company 
there can be no assurance that either existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to  or that achieve better consumer acceptance than  the company s products  or that the company will continue to remain competitive 
risks of litigation the company is subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business  including a variety of product liability and warranty claims typical in the recreational vehicle industry 
although the company does not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation  net of insurance coverage  will have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company  due to the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  there can be no assurance in this regard 
to date  the company has been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms the company considers acceptable 
the company s current policies jointly provide coverage against claims based on occurrences within the policy periods up to a maximum of million for each occurrence and million in the aggregate 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at acceptable levels or that the costs of insurance will be reasonable 
furthermore  successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
during  the company used net cash from operations of  net income and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization generated approximately million  which was offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in income taxes payable 
accounts receivable were up million  on a year to year basis  largely due to higher than normal end of year unit shipments in income taxes payable were abnormally high at the end of due to the holiday acquisition and the million reduction in was to a more normal level 
the company has credit facilities consisting of a term loan of million the term loan and a revolving line of credit of up to million the revolving loans 
the term loan bears interest at various rates based upon the prime lending rate announced from time to time by banker s trust company the prime rate or libor and is due and payable in full on march  the term loan requires monthly interest payments  quarterly principal payments and certain mandatory prepayments 
the mandatory prepayments consist of i an annual payment on april of each year  beginning april   of seventy five percent of the company s defined excess cash flow for the then most recently ended fiscal year  and ii a payment within two days of the sale of any holiday world dealership  of the net cash proceeds received by the company from such sale 
while the company has now sold all of the holiday world dealerships  as of january   the company was still holding million in notes receivable relating to the sales of the stores which will fall under provision ii when payment is received 
at january   the balance on the term loan was million with million at an effective interest rate of and  at 
at the election of the company  the revolving loans bear interest at variable interest rates based on the prime rate or libor 
the revolving loans are due and payable in full on march   and require monthly interest payments 
as of january   million was outstanding under the revolving loans  with an effective interest rate of 
the term loan and the revolving loans are collateralized by a security interest in all of the assets of the company and include various restrictions and financial covenants 
as a result of the sale of the three remaining holiday world retail dealerships in  the company no longer has any loans outstanding to finance retail inventory 
the company s principal working capital requirements are for purchases of inventory and  to a lesser extent  financing of trade receivables 
the company s dealers typically finance product purchases under wholesale floor plan arrangements with third parties as described below 
at january   the company had working capital of approximately million  an increase of million from working capital of million at december  the company and certain stockholders completed a secondary public offering of  shares of the company s common stock in june at per share  including  shares sold by the company 
the approximately million of net proceeds to the company from this offering were used to pay down the outstanding balance under its revolving loans with the remainder being added to working capital 
the company has been using short term credit facilities and cash flow to finance its construction of facilities and other capital expenditures 
the company primarily used long term debt and redeemable preferred stock to finance the holiday acquisition 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  primarily for the wakarusa  indiana motorized manufacturing facility 
this facility approximately doubled the company s production capacity of motor coaches 
the company started construction of a new paint facility and finish area adjacent to the new wakarusa facility in the fourth quarter of the new paint facility is expected to cost approximately million and will be operational by the end of the first quarter of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in will total approximately to million  of which an estimated million will be used to finish construction of the new wakarusa paint facility 
the company spent approximately  for new hardware and software in to upgrade the company s management information systems  including software to handle the year issue  and plans to spend  in to complete this project 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company further expands its operations to address greater than anticipated growth in the market for its products 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer fails to meet its commitments to the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period 
at january   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements  with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of products under any repurchase agreement  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected
