in addition  during fiscal the company began to spend a significant amount of funds in re validating its manufacturing processes at its texas facility 
in  the food and drug administration fda issued the texas facility a warning letter  citing several inadequacies in the company s adherence to fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda was specifically concerned with the method by which the company had performed its initial validation of the manufacturing processes in the texas facility 
the company agreed to re validate the facility  as well as correct the other items in the warning letter  and in july   submitted to the fda a schedule for completion of these items 
in august  the fda returned to the texas facility to perform a comprehensive gmp compliance audit  which included reviewing the company s progress in completing the remaining items contained in the warning letter

the intracel agreement also requires the company to pay million a year for three years to defray the costs of the clinical trials for the cancer treatment product  beginning in january  as well as pay an additional million upon the completion of certain milestones 
the company expects to pay the first milestone payment of million in fiscal the company s board of directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program 
it is the general philosophy of the company to repurchase a similar number of shares  subject to market conditions and cash availability  as are issued for the exercise of stock options previously granted to employees of the company under existing stock option plans 
during fiscal the company repurchased  shares for an aggregate consideration of million 
during fiscal   shares were repurchased for million 
the company s principal source of liquidity at march  consisted of million in cash and short term marketable securities plus million available under the existing line of credit 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  its cash and marketable securities and funds available under its line of credit will be adequate to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company utilizes a variety of programs across its various domestic and international entities for its core systems of distribution  finance and manufacturing 
the company has completed an assessment of its core software 
while it has determined that the majority of these systems are year compliant  it will have to modify certain portions of some of the these systems in order for them to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
because the company s computer programs consist predominantly of packaged software for which the majority of the vendor s offer a year upgrade  and the company believes that it can implement the necessary modifications primarily using the company s personnel  the cost of the year software upgrade is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
it is anticipated that the year project will be completed not later than the middle of calendar  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to the existing core computer systems  the year issue will not pose a significant operational problem 
however  if such modifications are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  each company the company conducts business with  such as banks  payroll processors  vendors and customers  must address their own year issue 
while the company can take certain steps to assess the compliance status of these entities  it cannot insure that all of these will eventually be compliant 
this may affect the ability of the company  among other things  to obtain critical supplies or receive payment on outstanding invoices 
depending on the extent of such issues  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year project are based on management s best estimates  which assume certain future events  including the continued availability of certain resources 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the effectiveness of the upgrades received from the company s software vendors at addressing the year issue  the results of the in progress assessment and similar uncertainties 
factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this management s discussion are forward looking statements  the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the discussion of such matters in the forward looking statements 
due to the nature of the company s products and business  the company has been and will be involved in various legal actions arising in the course of business  some of which involve product liability and intellectual property claims 
with respect to product liability issues  the litigation and regulatory risks will continue to exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
it is possible that adverse results arising from product liability or intellectual property actions  as well as adverse results arising from regulatory or administrative proceedings  could negatively affect the company s future results of operations 
the company has been and may be in the future the subject of negative publicity  which can arise from various sources  ranging from the news media to legislative and regulatory investigations 
there can be no assurance that such negative publicity will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  its results of operations or the market price of its stock 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increase in product liability claims 
the company s products  development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction  manufacturing  labeling and recordkeeping procedures for medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance from the fda for new products and existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
in addition  certain of the company s products that are in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval pma process with the fda 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect the company 
the fda  various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of penalties  product recalls  consent decrees or product seizures 
each of the company s major business segments operates its manufacturing  warehousing and research and development activities in a single facility 
while the company has some limited protection in the form of basic insurance coverage  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event of a fire or similar catastrophe
