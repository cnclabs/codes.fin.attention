item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
product groups the company s principal product groups are its mass data storage and instrumentation products and its professional video and other products 
the mass data storage and instrumentation products group includes i millimeter scanning recorders and library systems dst and dis products and related tape and after market equipment  and ii data acquisition and instrumentation products primarily dcrsi instrumentation recorders and related tape and after market equipment 
the company s professional video and other products group includes primarily its dct video recorders and image processing systems and related tape products and television aftermarket equipment 
these product groups are described below 
no other class of similar products accounted for more than of net sales during the comparison periods discussed below 
in recent years  the company has focused its efforts on high performance digital data storage and delivery systems for the emerging commercial mass data storage market  and has discontinued many older products and businesses 
the company operates in one industry segment for financial reporting purposes the design  development  production and distribution of high speed  high capacity magnetic recording products and systems 
the following table shows sales of the company s products by product group for the past three years 
net sales in millions mass data storage instrumentation professional video and other products total net sales results of operations for the three years ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in from million in  compared to million in the anticipated continuing decline in sales of professional video and other products accounted for the majority of the decline in net sales during and in  sales of the company s millimeter product line declined from levels and sales of instrumentation recorders increased modestly during the period 
the company doubled the capacity of its millimeter product line early in and passed along this improvement to the customer at no increase in selling price 
although the company shipped more megabytes of millimeter tape based storage  its revenues for this product category declined during the fiscal year  due also to declining sales to customers in the oil and gas industry and the government 
in  the increase in sales of millimeter tape based mass data storage and instrumentation products offset the decline in sales of professional video recording products and other products 
the company s backlog of firm orders increased to million at december  from million at december  the company typically operates with low levels of backlog  requiring it to obtain the vast majority of each period s orders in the same period that they must be shipped to the customer 
historically  a small number of large orders has significantly impacted sales levels and often orders are received late in the quarter making it difficult to predict sales levels in future periods 
see business fluctuations in operating results  seasonality  backlog 
management currently believes that net sales of its existing products will decline materially in the first quarter of and in fiscal  relative to comparable periods 
mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders 
sales of mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders and related after market products decreased by from to  after experiencing a increase in from levels 
early in  the company doubled the density of its millimeter tape based storage products without increasing the selling price in order to retain the price performance advantage over competing tape based storage products and hard disk drives 
accordingly  while the company shipped a larger amount of capacity measured in megabytes  revenues in this product category declined in from levels 
revenues from these products in were also affected by declining sales to customers in the oil and gas industry and the government 
in addition to retaining its price performance advantage  broader commercial acceptance of its millimeter storage systems will depend significantly on the integration and vendor support of third party application software  which are often beyond the company s control 
the cost efficiency of the company s millimeter storage systems has historically been dependent on data intensive applications  such as those which incorporate video  graphics and other images  requiring storage capacity materially greater than those required by traditional alphanumeric applications 
the company has concentrated its sales and marketing efforts primarily in certain specialized vertical markets  such as digital special effects creation and d seismic data gathering and analysis  that can utilize the unique performance capabilities of the company s millimeter scanning recorders 
industry sources predict that by  image based storage content will account for of all storage  up from today 
in order to capitalize on this increasing demand for storage  the company may be required to increase its sales and marketing efforts to penetrate the commercial data processing market  and there is typically a lag from the time such efforts are initiated until additional revenues are generated 
a significant portion of instrumentation product sales reflect purchases by the federal government 
direct and indirect sales to us government agencies amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net sales in those years 
while sales to government agencies have historically consisted primarily of data acquisition and instrumentation recorders  the company has recently experienced an increase in sales of millimeter based data storage products to these customers 
sales to government agencies fluctuate as a result of changes in government spending programs including defense programs  and may be adversely impacted by congressional appropriations discussions 
the company is unable to forecast the extent to which sales may be adversely affected in future periods by these factors 
professional video recording and other products 
sales of professional video recording products and all other products consisting primarily of television after market products continued to decline as anticipated and as previously disclosed 
in and  sales of the company s dct products accounted for all of the company s professional television product sales 
the company s dct digital products were designed for existing broadcast transmission standards  which are expected to become obsolete upon the adoption of new digital transmission standards that were recently announced 
the company anticipates that its professional video product sales will continue to decline pending the establishment of new standards and until new products can be introduced that are designed for them 
the company also anticipates a continuing reduction in the sale of television after market products for these same reasons 
such sales declines could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance as to when broadcasters will re equip for the new transmission standards or whether the company will be successful in any future efforts it may undertake to design and sell new products based on such standards 
the company is exploring ways to increase its market presence in the professional video industry  capitalizing on its reputation in television and video recording  which may include acquisitions of products and or businesses that serve these markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in integrating these products and businesses into its operations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in the improved gross margin percentages reflect the effects of the company s cost containment activities  which have reduced fixed manufacturing and administrative costs  as well as an improved sales mix of newer  high margin products 
if sales of the company s relatively high margin instrumentation recorders are adversely affected by pressure on government agencies to further reduce spending  gross margins in future periods could be adversely affected 
also  the company may elect to use aggressive pricing as a marketing strategy to enter new markets for its storage products 
while these efforts would be designed ultimately to increase revenues and profitability  they might reduce the gross margin percentage of net sales in the current period 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in spending levels included million in  million in and million in relating to patent infringement litigation with a foreign consumer products manufacturer 
while the company anticipates that the appeal of this litigation will be heard late in  it anticipates that it will not incur material costs related to this matter in excluding such costs  selling and administrative costs declined in  reflecting savings realized in facility operating costs from levels incurred in as a result of relocating the company s headquarters into smaller facilities 
the company anticipates that it will need to increase its sales and marketing efforts to be successful in penetrating the commercial data markets with its millimeter storage products 
also  if it pursues additional opportunities in video and image processing  the company forecasts that selling and administrative expenses may increase as a percentage of sales in future periods until such new business efforts begin to generate additional revenues 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the company does not capitalize a material amount of rd e expenditures 
the majority of rd e expenses in each of these years was used to enhance the price performance levels of the company s mass data storage products  as well as to integrate the company s storage systems with various computer manufacturers servers  workstations and other computer systems 
since the second half of  the company has been investing in the development of keepered media technology and has spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  on commercializing this technology for use in hard disk drives 
the keepered media development program was substantially completed during the company has transferred this program to a long term research and development project to assess whether the technology might be commercially employed with advanced head technologies 
continuing expenses for keepered media research are estimated to be less than million annually 
the company is committed to investing in research  development and engineering programs at levels that can be supported by current levels of sales 
royalty income 
royalty income was million in  million in and million in the company s royalty income derives from patent licenses  and the company receives most of its royalty income from licenses with companies that manufacture consumer video products such as vcrs and camcorders and  in certain cases  professional video tape recorders 
during this period a growing portion of royalty income related to mm video recorders and camcorders 
in  the company negotiated its first license for use of certain of its patents in the manufacture of mm digital video recorders 
the company intends to pursue additional digital video recorder licensees 
the company is also assessing whether its patented technology is being used by manufacturers of video games  dvd recorders and digital television receivers 
there can be no assurance that the company s technology is being utilized by the manufacturers of these products or  if used  whether the company will be able to negotiate license agreements with the manufacturers 
royalty income has historically fluctuated widely due to a number of factors that the company can not predict or control  such as the extent of use of the company s patented technology by third parties  the materiality of any non recurring royalties received as the result of negotiated settlements for products sold by manufacturers prior to entering into licensing agreements with the company  the extent which the company must pursue litigation in order to enforce its patents  and the ultimate success of its licensing and litigation activities 
the costs of patent litigation can be material  and the institution of patent enforcement litigation may also increase the risk of counterclaims alleging infringement by the company of patents held by third parties or seeking to invalidate patents held by the company 
see legal proceedings  above 
restructuring charges credits 
in connection with the company s restructuring that was substantially completed in  the company had accrued for the estimated future costs of vacated leased property and the closure of certain foreign subsidiaries 
in the past three years  the company has entered into transactions that reduced its anticipated obligations under several vacated leases 
in addition  certain expenses related to the closure of foreign subsidiaries were less than originally anticipated 
in  the amount of restructuring credit recognized in income is net of a reserve that was recorded to write off certain fixed assets and to provide for certain other costs totaling million in connection with the transfer of the keepered media program to a long term research and development project 
as of december   the company had a remaining balance of million of accrued restructuring costs 
the company will continue to evaluate the amount of accrued restructuring costs on a quarterly basis  and the company may make additional adjustments in future periods if it determines that its actual obligations will differ significantly from the amounts accrued 
operating income 
operating income was million of net sales in  million of net sales in and million of net sales in operating income was positively impacted by the receipt of negotiated license settlements in addition to regular recurring license payments  improved gross margins due to an improved sales mix of products  continuing focus on cost controls on recurring selling and administrative expenses and restructuring credits 
patent infringement litigation costs  rd e spending on keepered media and continuing declines in sales  particularly sales of professional video and other products  adversely impacted operating income as discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense was not material in  million in and million in in the first quarter of  the holders of the then outstanding zero coupon convertible notes with a principal amount at maturity of million converted the notes into approximately million shares of common stock 
also  in january  the mortgage on the real property in redwood city  california was repaid from the cash proceeds of the sale of such property 
in january  the company issued million of senior notes due and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock to certain institutional investors 
accordingly  leverage and interest expense will increase in from current levels 
amortization of debt financing costs 
these amounts reflect periodic amortization of financing costs over the remaining terms of the debt 
due to the conversion of the zero coupon notes and the repayment of the mortgage in  the remaining deferred financing costs were written off during financing costs associated with the january issuance of the senior notes  estimated to total million  will be charged to expense over years 
interest income 
interest income is earned on cash balances  and in and interest income was imputed on the notes received in connection with the sale of the company s redwood city  california property in the notes were fully paid in pending application of the proceeds of the senior notes  they have been invested in short term government securities 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from the company s foreign operations 
in  such amounts included a gain of million on the sale of the smaller of its two manufacturing facilities in colorado springs  colorado  offset by moving related expenditures of million at the redwood city  california facility 
provision for income taxes 
the company was not required to include any material provision for us federal income tax in any of the last three fiscal years due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and timing differences 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million  expiring in the years through as a result of financing transactions that were completed in and  the company is limited in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can offset consolidated federal taxable income in a given year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derives pretax foreign income from its international operations  which are conducted principally by its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s royalty income is subject  in certain cases  to foreign tax withholding 
such income is taxed by foreign taxing authorities  and the company s domestic interest and amortization expenses and operating loss carryforwards are not deductible in computing such foreign taxes 
the provisions for income taxes in  and consist primarily of foreign income taxes and withholding taxes on royalty income 
gain of business held for disposition 
in november  the company completed the disposition of the media subsidiaries  which had been accounted for as a business held for disposition since the quarter ended june the sale did not result in the receipt of any cash proceeds by the company  and the non recurring gain of million in represented the elimination of net liabilities of media  less taxes and other costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income 
the company reported net income of million in  million in and million in net income benefited from the non recurring gain of million on the sale of media in and from the factors discussed above in operating income 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flow 
at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million  an increase from million at december  in addition  in january  the company issued million of senior notes 
the net proceeds of the senior notes are available for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions of and investments in new business 
pending application for such purposes  the net proceeds are being invested in short term government securities 
the increase in cash and short term investments in and in was due in part to receipt of the proceeds of repayment of certain notes received from the sale of portions of the company s redwood city  california facilities in the company s operating activities generated cash of million in and used cash of million in the improvement in operating cash flow resulted from the factors discussed above in operating income 
the company s decision to increase inventories to support sales of its millimeter dst and dis products is the primary reason for the increase of million in inventories at december  from december  the increased investment in inventories  particularly with respect to its library systems  which have a limited sales history  may expose the company to an increased risk of inventory write offs 
the company has available a working capital and letter of credit facility that allows it to borrow up to million through may  based on eligible accounts receivable 
at december   the company had no material borrowings outstanding and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
financing transactions 
in january  the company repaid the balance of the million mortgage loan on the redwood city  california property from a portion of the cash proceeds of the sale 
also  during  the company s convertible notes with an aggregate face amount at maturity of million were converted into approximately million shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase approximately million shares were exercised 
as of december   the company became obligated to redeem the  outstanding shares of its noncumulative preferred stock  to the extent of funds legally available therefor generally the excess of the value of assets over liabilities  at a redemption price of  per share 
as of december   the company did not have any funds legally available to redeem the noncumulative preferred stock  and the company cannot predict when  and to what extent  it will generate any legally available funds to redeem the noncumulative preferred stock 
the company will remain obligated to redeem such shares from time to time in future fiscal periods to the extent funds become legally available for redemption  and will generally be precluded from declaring any cash dividends on  or repurchasing shares of  its common stock  until the noncumulative preferred stock has been redeemed in full 
redemption of the noncumulative preferred stock for cash in future periods could have a negative impact on the company s liquidity 
under certain circumstances the company may redeem the noncumulative preferred stock by issuing common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering  shares of common stock which may be offered from time to time by the company  the proceeds of which would be used for general corporate purposes 
the sale of common stock covered by the shelf registration statement could adversely affect the market price for the common stock  and would dilute current stockholders interest by approximately if all such shares were to be issued 
the company does not currently anticipate proceeding with this financing based on the current market price of the company s common stock 
in january  the company issued million of its senior notes  together with warrants to purchase million outstanding shares of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share at any time on or prior to march  the warrants  if exercised  would represent approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock on a diluted basis 
as a result of the issuance of the senior notes  the company s total indebtedness and future debt service obligations have increased significantly from prior levels 
the company is required to use its best efforts to register the senior notes and warrants with the securities and exchange commission in order to permit public resales of these securities in accordance with the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds of the offering have been invested in short term government securities  the yield on which investments is substantially lower than the interest charges on the senior notes 
the company has wide discretion as to how the proceeds may be invested  including for the acquisitions of and investments in new businesses 
any such investments or acquisitions  if made  might not pay a current return  which could require the company to fund debt service obligations on the senior notes out of its liquidity and cash flow from its existing operations 
the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains customary affirmative and negative restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional senior debt  the payment of dividends  the sale of assets and other actions by the company and certain restricted subsidiaries 
under such indenture the company may  in general  issue additional senior debt  without meeting certain fixed charges coverage tests  up to million 
the company has no present plans to issue any such additional debt  but may do so in the future if investment or acquisition opportunities are subsequently identified that require additional capital funds
