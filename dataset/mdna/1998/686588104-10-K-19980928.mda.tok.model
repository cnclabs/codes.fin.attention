item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital to purchase and develop land  to construct units  to fund related carrying costs and overhead and to fund various advertising and marketing programs to facilitate sales 
the company s sources of capital include funds derived from operations  sales of assets and various borrowings  most of which are secured 
at june   the company had approximately  available to be drawn under existing secured revolving and construction loans for planned development expenditures 
these expenditures include site preparation  roads  water and sewer lines  impact fees and earthwork  as well as the construction costs of the homes and amenities 
the company believes that the funds generated from operations and financing commitments from commercial lenders will provide the company with sufficient capital to meet its operating needs through fiscal the company has continued its ongoing land acquisition efforts during fiscal during this period  the company acquired twelve additional parcels of land with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  marketing activities had commenced on a majority of these communities as of june  the remaining communities will commence marketing activities in fiscal the company is continuing to expand its land acquisition efforts 
as of june   the company had contracted to purchase fourteen additional tracts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  these purchase agreements are subject to due diligence review and are contingent upon the receipt of governmental approvals 
the company expects to utilize purchase money mortgages  secured financings and existing capital resources to finance these acquisitions 
the company anticipates completing a majority of these acquisitions during fiscal and overview of operations the tables included in item business summarize the company s revenues  new orders and backlog data for the year ended june  with comparable data for fiscal and new orders for fiscal increased by approximately to  on units compared to  on units during fiscal the company continues to expand its geographic marketing areas within pennsylvania and new jersey with new communities primarily in the same or adjacent counties to its existing development projects 
this increase in new orders resulted from the opening of eight additional selling communities in fiscal  including two new communities in mount laurel  evesham and lumberton townships in burlington county  as well as in princeton township in mercer county  and gloucester township in camden county 
the average price per unit of revenues earned and new orders increased due to a change in product mix towards higher priced townhouse and single family homes  along with the settlement of fewer condominiums  as well as price increases at certain existing communities 
the company expects this trend to continue 
the dollar backlog at june  increased approximately to  on homes  as compared to the backlog at june  of  on homes 
the company s continued geographic diversification with its new communities  coupled with favorable economic conditions and consumer sentiment  resulted in the increased backlog level 
the company anticipates delivering substantially all of its backlog units during fiscal inflation inflation can have a significant impact on the company s liquidity 
rising costs of land  materials  labor  interest and administrative costs have generally been recoverable in prior years through increased selling prices 
the company has been able to increase prices to cover portions of these costs 
however  there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to increase prices to cover the effects of inflation in the future 
year the company began assessing its year yk compliance issues at the beginning of fiscal and at that time  determined that its primary internal computer hardware and computer software were not yk compliant 
subsequently  the company determined that it would be more cost efficient to install a new yk compliant software package than to modify the existing software package 
in september  after significant review of various software packages  the company contracted to purchase a new software package  including several specific enhancements to modify the software to meet the company s needs 
as part of the company s contingency plan  in order to mitigate the risks associated with the possibility that the software enhancements will not be completed on time  the company has required that the base software package be placed in escrow 
the company believes that implementation of the base software package will require substantially less time than the enhanced software package 
in addition  the company has proposed to upgrade its existing primary computer hardware system to support the new computer software package 
the company is currently in the process of installing new hardware and software for the application development stage of its yk computer compliance program and the company s goal is to complete the final phase  implementation  by june  the company is also investigating the yk compliance status of its vendors  subcontractors and suppliers through the company s own internal vendor compliance effort 
this investigation is in its preliminary stages and the company s goal is to complete this investigation  as well as any corrective efforts by march  since the company does not rely on any individual vendor  subcontractor or supplier for a significant portion of its operations  the potential impact of yk non compliance risks in this area are not considered significant to the company 
the company has incurred approximately  to date  including consulting fees  internal staff costs and other expenses 
the company expects to incur additional expenditures of approximately  in the next fiscal year to be yk compliant 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to achieve internal yk compliance  any potential future business interruptions  costs  damages or losses related thereto  are also dependent upon the yk compliance of third parties 
in the event that the company or any of the company s significant vendors  subcontractors or suppliers experience disruptions due to the yk issue  the company s operations could be adversely affected 
the yk issue is universal and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that complete yk compliance can be achieved without significant additional costs 
forward looking statement the company s estimates of costs and completion dates for its yk readiness program represent management s best estimates 
these estimates are based upon many assumptions  including the availability of external resources to assist with systems remediation and replacement efforts  key third party suppliers  vendors and customers being yk compliant and in the event of non compliance  the company s execution of its contingency plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company  due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the area of interest rate changes 
a majority of the company s debt is variable based on the prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
based on current operations  an increase in interest rates of basis points will increase cost of sales by approximately  historically  the company has been able to increase prices to cover portions of any increase in interest rates 
as a result  the company believes that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will not result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company
