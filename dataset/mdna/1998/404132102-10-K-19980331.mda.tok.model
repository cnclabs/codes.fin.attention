general the company s primary sources of revenue are earned premium and investment income derived from its insurance company operations  and management fee and commission income generated from its insurance agency and services operations 
the company s core underwriting activities involve providing aviation  marine  offshore energy  property  accident and health  and lenders single interest insurance  which is underwritten on both a direct and a reinsurance basis  marketed directly by the company and produced by independent agents 
the company concentrates on first party  physical damage coverages and lines of business which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event and the reporting of claims to the company 
during recent years  the company has substantially increased its capital and surplus through the issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt  and earnings  thereby enabling it to increase the underwriting capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries 
the company has utilized this additional capital by increasing underwriting activity across many of its core lines of business  emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in time 
in each line of business  the company also cedes premium through the purchase of reinsurance in types and amounts appropriate to the line of business  market conditions and the company s desired net risk retention profile 
the company s insurance agency operations underwrite and service domestic general aviation  medical stop loss  lenders single interest  occupational accident  and accident and health insurance and reinsurance business 
they also place reinsurance for the company s insurance company operations and other non affiliated insurance companies 
since  the company has focused its acquisition activities on expanding its insurance agency and services operations for three principal reasons 
firstly  is an attempt to increase the management fee and commission income revenue component of the company s total revenue  which management believes to be a more predictable and more stable source of revenue than the potential underwriting gain from insurance company operations 
secondly  is an effort to insulate the company from a decline in its net earnings growth rate as insurance premium rates become more competitive in the lines of business in which the company specializes in and the company becomes more selective in its underwriting approach  resulting in reduced written premium 
thirdly  is to provide a future source of premium revenue to the company s insurance company subsidiaries 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain premium revenue information for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands direct    reinsurance assumed    gross written premium    reinsurance ceded    net written premium    change in unearned premium    net earned premium    the following table sets forth the relationships of certain income statement items as a percent of total revenue for the three years ended december  net earned premium management fee and commission income net investment income all other income total revenue loss and lae net operating expense interest expense earnings before taxes income taxes net earnings reinsurance assumed includes all reinsurance business written  including facultative reinsurance

nwp for decreased to million from million in  due to an increase in the amount of ceded reinsurance 
net earned premium decreased to million in compared to million in reflecting the reduction in nwp and the reduced retentions of the company 
the company expects gwp to increase during primarily due to internal growth as the company s managing general agency subsidiaries transfer business from non affiliated insurance companies to the company s insurance company operations 
however  nwp and net earned premium will be unchanged as the company does not intend to increase its retentions at this time 
management fee and commission income in increased to million from million in  reflecting internal growth and the acquisition of several agencies in the company expects management fee and commission income to continue to increase due to the effect of recent and future acquisitions and internal growth

aic  acquired in june   recorded a million increase in loss and lae reserves during december   predominately relating to and claims incurred prior to the company s acquisition of aic 
this increase in reserves was made to bring aic s reserving practices consistent with the more conservative method used by the company s other insurance company operations 
the company expects the increase in loss reserves to be adequate to cover any subsequent adverse development of aic s prior losses 
loss and lae decreased million in  to million  reflecting the increased use of reinsurance  despite the million reserve strengthening charge taken by aic 
during  the company had net loss and lae redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in during  the company had gross loss and lae deficiency of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency comes from two primary sources 
firstly  the development of several large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or reserves were increased as subsequent information became available  however  as most of these policies were substantially reinsured  there is no material effect to the company s net earnings 
secondly  is the run off of the retrocessional excess of loss business which the company underwrote between and this development  million in compared to million in  is primarily due to the delay in reporting of catastrophe losses by the london insurance market  coupled with the unprecedented number of catastrophes during the period in which the company underwrote this business 
this business is also substantially reinsured  thereby not having a material effect on the company s net earnings 
the company continues to believe it has materially provided for all net incurred losses 
compensation expense increased million or in  to million due to the increase in personnel resulting from acquisitions completed during  along with an increase in management personnel hired to oversee the integration of the company s many acquisitions 
other operating expense increased to million in these expenses reflect increased expenditures required to meet the overall growth in business and from acquisitions

year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenue during increased to million from million in gwp decreased to million from million in  while nwp increased from million in to million in the decrease in written premium was a result of the planned exit from the offshore energy business as a result of increased competition that has driven rates below acceptable levels  as well as the softening in marine rates and  more recently  property rates

also  as an s corporation  ldg was exempt from federal income taxes through may  had ldg been subject to federal income taxes for both years  additional income tax expense of million and  would have been recorded during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net earnings increased to million in from million in diluted earnings per share increased to in from in the company s insurance company subsidiaries statutory combined ratio was for compared to in the company s combined ratio remains significantly better than the industry average 
liquidity and capital resources hcc completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock during october  and secondary public offerings of  shares of common stock in september  and  shares of common stock in june  the offerings significantly improved the capital resources of the company 
the net proceeds of the offerings have been used to reduce the company s indebtedness and to contribute capital to its insurance company subsidiaries 
hc now has more than million in policyholders surplus 
this additional capital enables hc to write significantly more premium and to have sufficient financial size and strength to operate in the current insurance industry environment 
the company receives substantial cash from premiums and reinsurance recoverables  and  to a lesser extent  investment income  proceeds from sales and redemptions of investment assets and management fee and commission income 
the principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and lae  payment of premiums to reinsurers  purchase of investments  debt service  policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  income and other taxes and dividends 
during  hc renewed its existing credit facility the hc facility which provides for a million bank line of credit for the issuance of letters of credit and for short term borrowings at the prime rate of interest 
the hc facility is collateralized by securities with a market value equal to of the total sum of the letters of credit issued and cash advances outstanding 
the hc facility matures on april  as of december   letters of credit in the amount of million were issued on behalf of hc to collateralize certain reinsurance obligations 
effective december   the company executed a million revolving credit facility the facility with a group of banks 
borrowings under the facility may be made by the company until the expiration of the facility on december   at which time all principal is due 
outstanding loans under the facility bear interest at the company s option at either the prime rate at december  or at the current london interbank offering rate libor at december  plus 
the facility is collateralized by the common stock of hc and aic 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants  including without limitation  minimum net worth requirements for the company and certain subsidiaries  restrictions on certain extraordinary corporate actions  notice requirements for certain material occurences and required maintenance of specified financial ratios 
the initial funding from the facility was used  among other things  to refinance hcc s then existing outstanding loans 
the company maintains a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations 
as of december   the company had cash and short term investments of approximately million 
the company s consolidated investment portfolio of million as of december  of which million is short term investments  is available to provide additional liquidity and cash for operations 
property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of texas are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any month period  without the prior written consent of the commissioner of insurance  to the greater of net investment income or of statutory policyholders surplus 
hc paid no dividends in to hcc 
during  hc s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  short term investments and the bank lines of credit will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its anticipated needs for the foreseeable future 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million compared to million at december  due to the company s history of consistent earnings  strong operating cash flows and expectations for the future  it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset 
as of december   the domestic insurance company subsidiaries total adjusted capital is significantly in excess of the naic authorized control level risk based capital 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gwp should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and nwp should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries maintain a premium to surplus ratio significantly lower than such guidelines  and for the year ended december   their annual statutory gwp was of their statutory policyholders surplus and their nwp was of their statutory policyholders surplus 
impact of inflation the company s operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and lae are known 
although management considers the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates for competitive reasons  such premiums may not adequately compensate the company for the effects of inflation 
however  as the majority of the company s business is comprised of lines which have short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to the company and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products which are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of medical costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
no express provision for inflation is made  although trends are considered when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves 
claim reserves are subject to a continuing review process to assess their adequacy and are adjusted as deemed appropriate 
in addition  the market value of the investments held by the company varies depending on economic and market conditions and interest rates  which are highly sensitive to the policies of governmental and regulatory authorities 
any significant increase in interest rates could therefore have a material adverse effect on the market value of the company s investments 
exchange rate fluctuations the company underwrites risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
it establishes and maintains loss reserves with respect to these policies in their respective currencies 
these reserves are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which can have an effect on the company s net earnings 
the company s principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the major european currencies and the united states dollar 
for the years ended december   and  the loss from currency conversion was   and  respectively 
from time to time the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations  primarily gbp 
the company s balances denominated in foreign currencies fluctuate as transactions are recorded and settled 
during  the average gbp liability  for subsidiaries whose functional currency was the united states dollar  was approximately l  million at the december   rate of exchange which was hedged by an average open forward contract balance of approximately l   at the december   rate of exchange 
there were no open foreign currency forward contracts as of december  the company may continue to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not do so as any form of speculative or trading investment 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  these sfas s require that additional information be included in a complete set of financial statements  but will have no effect on the company s net earnings  shareholders equity or cash flows 
the company does not expect to change its definition of segments when sfas no 
is adopted 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company  together with outside vendors engaged by the company  has made assessments of the company s potential year exposure 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and in connection with planned conversions to new software  the year issue will be mitigated 
the company has implemented a plan to mitigate its year exposure  including the identification  selection and implementation of a new year compliant software system at an insurance company subsidiary 
management believes that the plan is progressing such that year exposures will be mitigated prior to any critical date and by october  with respect to the insurance company subsidiary where the company s major year risk exists 
the company is utilizing and will continue to utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace its computer systems such that the reprogrammed or new systems will cause the company to be year compliant in advance of respective critical dates 
the total estimated remaining cost of modification of existing software and new year compliant systems is  which includes   attributable to the planned purchase and implementation of new systems  principally to replace the above mentioned insurance company subsidiary s system 
the cost of this new software will be capitalized 
the remaining estimated cost of  will be expensed as incurred over the next two years 
the level of expense is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations 
the cost of modification of existing systems to become year compliant and of the new year compliant software is to be funded out of operating cash flow  which is sufficient to provide the funding 
the cost estimates are management s best estimates based upon assumed future events which could change 
in  the company expensed  with respect to year compliance and capitalized  with respect to new year compliant software purchases and installations 
the company does not believe that it has significant year exposure with respect to its vendors and the company s software vendor subsidiary s products are year compliant
