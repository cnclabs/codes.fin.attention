item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
the company was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician practice management business 
fonar s principal mri products are its quad and quad mri scanners 
having received the necessary fda approvals for its quad scanners  the company believes it is in a position to aggressively seek new sales 
the quad scanners are highly competitive and totally new non claustrophobic scanners not previously available in the mri market 
at 
tesla field strength  the quad magnet is the highest field open mri in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality for the first time 
the company expects vigorous sales from its new products 
as part of its scanner marketing program  the company attended the industry s annual trade show  rsna radiological society of north america in november  and and plans to do so again in november the company believes that it is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the rapidly expanding open mri market  as the manufacturer of the only high field open mri in the industry 
the company expects marked demand for this product since image quality increases as a direct proportion to magnetic field strength 
in addition  the company s new scanners provide improved image quality and high speed imaging at costs that are significantly less than the competition and more in keeping with the medical cost reduction demands being made by our national leaders on behalf of the public 
the company s efforts to reduce infringement of its intellectual property rights by competitors have produced material benefits  as reflected in the million recovered from general electric company 
after deduction of attorney s fees  the net amount of million was collected by the company on july  the full amount of the award was recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal hmca generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services including development  administration  accounting and billing and collection services together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients

the second acquisition was of raymond v 
damadian  md mr scanning centers management company rvdc  a company owned by fonar s principal stockholder  president and chairman of the board  raymond v

in addition  hmca sponsored the opening of two new multi specialty facilities during fiscal these facilities are located in albany county  new york and in melbourne  florida 
hmca did not actively engage in business until after june   which was the effective date of its acquisitions of the affordable companies and rvdc 
as separate businesses  the affordable companies had been engaged in business since and rvdc had been engaged in business since for financial statement presentation the results of operations  assets and liabilities of the company and rvdc have been consolidated for prior periods 
the affordable companies  central health and a a  have been consolidated effective as of the dates of their respective acquisitions 
the acquisition of dynamic was consummated on august   following the end of the fiscal year  and consequently is not reflected in the financial statements for fiscal the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue yk on its financial reporting systems and operations 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company is developing a plan to meet this issue 
the company is reviewing all in house computer based systems 
the mis department is updating or replacing older systems that are not yk compatible 
the company is also reviewing and has started to plan changes to its existing customer base of mri scanners 
the company expects that all computer based systems will be yk compliant and in the final phase of testing in the second quarter of based on preliminary information  costs of addressing these items are currently not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million as compared to net income of million on revenues of million for fiscal as a result of hmca s acquisitions  revenues attributable to the company s physician practice management services segment hmca increased dramatically  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal income of million was recognized from the company s physician practice management services in fiscal  as compared to a loss of  in fiscal revenues attributable to the company s medical equipment segment declined to million in fiscal from million  reflecting lower sales volume in fiscal results of operations for the medical equipment segment improved  however  from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal other income of million principally the net proceeds from the company s patent enforcement lawsuits and interest income of million were recognized by the company in fiscal as compared to other income of million principally the net proceeds from the company s patent enforcement lawsuits and interest income of  in fiscal costs of revenues and expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the expansion of the company s physician practice management services operations and an increase in research and development in the medical equipment segment 
costs of revenue and expenses for the company s physician practice management services increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal overall  costs of revenues and expenses for the company s medical equipment segment  however  declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal reflecting  most significantly  reductions in general and administrative expenses million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and costs of revenue million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal 
net income for the company for fiscal reflects the net income attributable to the award received by the company in its patent litigation 
revenues generated by sales of quad mri scanners were million of total revenues in fiscal  million approximately of total revenues in fiscal and million of total revenues in fiscal revenues attributable to sales of the company s ultimate scanners during the same period were  approximately of total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal and fiscal sales of beta scanners approximated million in fiscal approximately of total revenues as compared to in fiscal and of these revenues approximately were attributable to sales to affiliates in fiscal sales to affiliated parties represented approximately million of the company s revenues in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal gross profit margins on product sales to unrelated parties were negative in fiscal  negative in fiscal and negative in fiscal this reflects the losses on sales of the company s quad scanners 
the company s strategy is to attempt to hold down the price of its quad scanners and to increase profitability by reducing manufacturing costs and increasing volume 
the effectiveness of this strategy will not be discernible until higher sales volume for the company s quad scanners is achieved 
to reduce the cost of manufacturing its quad scanners  the company expanded its manufacturing capacity in fiscal by acquiring approximately million worth of new capital equipment 
in addition  the company expanded its operating capacity by hiring additional personnel 
notwithstanding the company s increased manufacturing activities  revenues attributable to the company s medical equipment segment declined to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  but were the same as the revenues of million in fiscal the company has not yet been able to achieve the sales volumes from its new quad scanners necessary to become profitable because of intense competition and the challenges of introducing a new product 
these trends reflect a decline in service revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal and a decrease in product sales in fiscal million from fiscal million  but an increase in product sales from fiscal million 
the decline in service revenue reflects the retirement of old scanners by the company s customers 
the company does not expect the decline in revenue to continue 
the company is enthusiastic about the future of its fonar product line see works in progress which will bring a new plateau of openness to diagnostic mri and a new frontier in surgery for performing surgical treatments using mri images to guide surgery 
continuing its tradition as the originator of mri  the company remained committed to maintaining its position as the leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal the company continued its investment in the development of its new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development none of which was capitalized as compared to   of which was capitalized in fiscal the research and development expenditure was approximately of revenues attributable to the company s medical equipment segment and of total revenues in and of medical equipment segment revenues in and of total revenues 
the company has continued its efforts to increase scanner sales in foreign countries as well as domestically 
based on sales to date  further indications of interest  meetings  sales trips abroad and negotiations  the company is optimistic that foreign sales will continue to prove a significant source of revenue 
the company continued to benefit as a result of programs set in motion in fiscal  namely strict cost containment initiatives and expanding the corporate business into a greater number of profitable enterprises within and related to the mri and medical industries eg  physician practice management  customer service  upgrades 
as a result of this expansion  the percentage of the company s revenue derived from sources other than scanner sales was approximately for fiscal and for fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   the company realized income of approximately million from the settlement of various legal disputes essentially its patent infringement actions as compared to approximately million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced net income of million on revenues of million as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal revenues and income losses attributable to the company s physician practice management services segment were million and million  respectively for fiscal and million and million  respectively for fiscal as the company expanded its operations and productive capacity  costs and expenses increased in fiscal cost of revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses attributable to rvdc were million and million respectively for fiscal and million and million  respectively for fiscal as at september   the company s backlog of unfilled scanner orders was approximately million  as compared to million at september  in fiscal the company invested  in research and development  of which was capitalized as compared to  in research and development  of which was capitalized in fiscal the research and development expenditure was approximately of revenues in and of revenues in during the fiscal year ended june   the company realized income of approximately million from the settlement of various legal disputes essentially its patent infringement actions as compared to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s liquidity and capital resources positions changed from the june  position as follows june  june  change working capital deficiency    the change in the company s working capital position resulted primarily from its investments in new equipment million  the cash portions of the purchase prices for its acquisitions million and its overall operating losses  notwithstanding a decrease in its current liabilities million as at june  as compared to million as at june  the increase in long term debt from million as at june  to million as at june  was attributable to notes issued in connection with hmca s acquisitions and new indebtedness for equipment and repayment of existing debt 
as at june   the company s past due obligations consisted of approximately million in past due taxes various state taxes  and approximately  in other past due indebtedness 
the company is seeking to enter into payment plans with taxing authorities with respect to past due taxes and to restructure its other past due indebtedness 
as of june   the company had no unused credit facilities with banks or financial institutions 
the company s business plan currently includes an aggressive program for manufacturing and selling its new line of quad scanners which are achieving success in the marketplace 
in addition the company plans  through its subsidiary  health management corporation of america  to develop and expand its ppm physician practice management business see description of business 
the company believes its present financial resources are sufficient to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
the company offers its products for sale or lease to customers 
cash flows from leasing transactions are derived under the terms of the underlying agreements 
over the long term  the company expects enhanced cash flows and increased revenues from such transactions while in the short term  such transactions impair cash flow 
in order to mitigate the short term effect on cash flow  the company previously had borrowed money secured by the leases and the underlying equipment 
such debt comprises substantially all of the remaining long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
in addition to leasing products to customers  the company has developed and begun to implement a new program to finance a portion of the purchase price of its scanners through a newly formed subsidiary  fonar acceptance corporation  and to assist the customer in obtaining the remaining portion of its financing through an independent source or sources 
the new program is intended to increase the overall profitability of the company by assisting in the sale of scanners and participating in the profits derived from financing those sales 
advances and notes to affiliates and related parties decreased by approximately million from june  to june  as these are long term assets  they tend to reduce the company s liquidity 
there were no past due receivables and lease payments from affiliates as at june  and june  since the company has restructured various long term loans and notes 
the significant changes included extended maturity dates  and the addition of unpaid interest to the note and loan balances 
capital expenditures for each of fiscal and approximated million and million  respectively  and substantially consisted of office and production equipment 
the company s business plan initiated in september  had as its objective the enhancement and stabilization of revenue streams through the generation of additional income from its installed base of scanners and leasing programs 
in addition  the company instituted strict cost containment programs 
while continuing to focus on new sources of income  the company now has commenced aggressive sales and manufacturing of its new generation of open mri scanners  the quad scanners and is reemphasizing mri scanner sales 
in addition  the company is enhancing its revenue by entering into the ppm physician practice management business through its new subsidiary  hmca 
cost containment programs continue in force notwithstanding an increase in costs and expenses resulting from increased manufacturing activity and marketing of its mri scanners 
these programs  which include increasing the portion of manufacturing conducted on the company s premises  have enabled the company to achieve significantly lower manufacturing costs than would have otherwise been experienced in the production of its quad scanners 
this has enabled the company to pass on to customers a much needed reduction in the sales price of mri scanners 
the company s plan calls for a continuing emphasis on providing its customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from the company s installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are eliminated in the consolidation 
the company will continue to aggressively develop and market upgrades and enhancements for previously installed scanners 
the company s working capital surplus as of june  approximates million  as compared to a working capital surplus of million as of june  during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately million from million in fiscal and cash used in investing activities increased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal cash used in financing activities increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million provided by in fiscal the company believes that the above mentioned financial resources will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
in addition  the company is exploring other more permanent financing alternatives which may become available as the success of the previously described programs accelerates
