item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
although the company has been expanding its international operations  approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal and in fiscal were derived from work performed in the gulf of mexico 
the offshore marine construction industry in the gulf of mexico is highly seasonal as a result of weather conditions and the timing of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s services has been performed during the period from june through november 
as a result  a disproportionate portion of the company s revenues  gross profit  and net income generally is earned during the second july through september and third october through december quarters of its fiscal year 
because of seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
the following table documents the seasonal nature of the company s operations by presenting the percentage of annual revenues  gross profit  and net income contributed during each fiscal quarter for the past three fiscal years and the three year weighted average for such periods

the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves on production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes
