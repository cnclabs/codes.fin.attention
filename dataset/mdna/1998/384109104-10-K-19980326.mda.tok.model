the cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales of percent in decreased from percent in  due to a combination of factors including modest price increases and improved manufacturing efficiencies  partially offset by material and manufacturing cost increases 
operating expenses operating expenses in declined percent from  primarily due to the impact of lower general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher selling expenses resulting from increased net sales 
the lower expense level is the result of the ongoing benefits of restructuring  exchange rates  higher investment returns on employee retirement plan assets  and elimination of discretionary contributions

graco is committed to expanding its sales by making significant investments in product development 
foreign currency effects foreign currency translations negatively impacted earnings before income taxes by million when compared to  and decreased earnings before income taxes by million in when compared to the reduced profits in both years were due to a strong us dollar versus other foreign currencies 
since approximately percent of the company s sales and percent of its product costs are in currencies other than the us dollar  a strong us dollar reduces the company s profits 
a weakening of the us dollar has the reverse impact on the company s profits 
gains and losses attributable to translating the financial statements for all non us subsidiaries  and the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts used to hedge these exposures  which are non speculative  are in other expense income 
other expense income the company s interest expense rose percent in  primarily reflecting an increase in the average levels of debt during the year 
this increase in debt levels resulted from higher short term debt during portions of other expense of million in  other income of million in  and million for  include  among other things  the foreign currency translation gains and losses discussed above  a million gain from the sale of real estate in  a million favorable settlement of a legal dispute in  a million favorable settlement of a legal dispute in  and a million gain from the sale of real estate in income taxes the company s net effective tax rate of percent in is five percentage points lower than the us federal tax rate of percent 
the decrease from the percent rate in is due primarily to foreign earnings being taxed at effective rates lower than the us rate as foreign subsidiary earnings permitted recognition of previously reserved deferred tax benefits and previous tax filings were validated 
the effective tax rate of percent in was lower than the rate of percent principally due to foreign earnings being taxed at lower effective rates than the us rate from the utilization of previously reserved net operating losses

year information systems disclosures the year issue is the result of a computer program being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could cause potential failure or miscalculation in date sensitive software that recognizes as  rather than the company is continuing its program  begun in  to ensure that all hardware and software will be year compliant 
a dedicated project team is expected to complete the conversion of core business applications in additional teams have initiated year compliance projects on the company s network  operating system software  and distributed systems 
the company has incurred costs totaling million during  and estimates a total of an additional to million to be spent in and to resolve year issues 
these costs are charged to expense as incurred and include software license fees and allocation of internal staff time 
incremental costs associated with year compliance are not anticipated to result in significant increases in future operating expenses and will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
rather  existing resources are being redeployed and other projects are being delayed to accommodate year related projects 
a contingency plan is being developed in for critical business applications to mitigate potential problems or delays associated with either new system replacements or established vendor delivery dates 
additionally  the company is working with customers and suppliers to assess the potential impact of their year compliance issues on graco 
although all companies have risks associated with the year  management believes that sufficient resources have been allocated and project plans are in place which will result in uninterrupted business activity with no material impact on operations or operating results
