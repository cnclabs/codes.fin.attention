item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company conducts its business through three operating groups within the transportation industry truck components and assemblies operations  a leading manufacturer of wheel end components  seating  steerable drive axles and gear boxes for the heavy duty truck industry  iron casting operations  a major producer of complex iron castings for a wide range of industries  and freight car operations  a leading manufacturer and lessor of new and rebuilt freight cars used for hauling coal  intermodal containers  highway trailers  agricultural and mining products 
during  the company s truck components and assemblies  iron castings and freight car operations generated net sales of million  million and million  respectively 
during  the company s truck components and assemblies  iron castings and freight car operations generated net sales of million  million and million  respectively 
the significant decline in demand experienced in and early in freight car operations produced significant operating losses that  coupled with the company s significant debt service requirements  offset strong operating income from its truck components and assemblies and iron castings operations 
although demand for freight cars has improved  the market remains subject to pricing competitiveness in a freight car market characterized by uneven demand and production overcapacity 
the company s sales are affected to a significant degree by the freight car and class truck markets 
both the freight and car and class truck markets are subjected to significant fluctuations due to economic conditions  changes in the alternative methods of transportation and other factors 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such markets will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
freight car operations sales are driven principally by the number and type of freight cars delivered in any given period 
due to the large size of customer orders  the specific time frame for delivery of freight cars ordered and variations in the mix of cars ordered  the number and type of cars produced in any given period may fluctuate greatly 
as a result  the company s revenues and results of operations and cash flows from operations may fluctuate as well 
the company completed the acquisition of truck components inc tci on august  and bostrom seating  inc bostrom on january  both acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  their operating results were included in the company s reported results from their respective acquisition dates 
such results have a significant impact on the comparative discussions below

results of operations years ended december  and total revenue total revenue in increased to million from million in the revenue increase of million was due to an increase in truck component revenues of million  an increase in iron castings revenues of million and an increase in freight car revenues of million 
for the year  shipments of freight cars were  including cars sold to the company s lease fleet  compared to  freight cars including cars sold to the company s lease fleet in as of december   the company s backlog of new and rebuilt cars was  compared with new and rebuilt freight cars as of december  at december   the company had  freight cars on lease  and the leasing business for the year generated million in revenue and million in operating income before an million gain on the sale of leased freight cars 
the leasing business generated million in revenue and million in operating income before a million gain on the sale of leased freight cars in the prior year 
cost of sales manufacturing and gross profit cost of sales manufacturing for as a percent of manufacturing sales was  compared with in related gross profits were and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit margins resulted primarily from lower gross profit margins in freight car operations due to reduced volume in the first half of the year and pricing pressure throughout the year offset partially by increased profit margins in the truck component operations and iron castings business 
selling  general  administrative and amortization expenses selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue were and in and  respectively 
actual selling  general and administrative expenses declined million from levels as a result of cost reduction measures undertaken at the company s freight car operations

the company increased its operating income by increasing gross profits by million  a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  a reduction in amortization expense of million  a reduction of environmental reserves of million offset by a decline in gain on sale of leased freight cars of million 
during the third quarter of  the company settled two pending lawsuits related to indemnification of environmental cleanup costs from a former owner of gunite  which reduced outstanding environmental liabilities by million other interest expense  net  was million in compared to in interest expense in and resulted from borrowings under the senior bank facilities and the senior subordinated notes  as well as from the jaix leasing loans which were used to finance the addition of freight cars for the lease fleet 
in conjunction with the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes and to refinance million of tranche a term debt  the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million after tax  primarily related to the write off of million of deferred financing costs 
net income and diluted earnings per share for were million and  respectively  compared to net loss and diluted loss per share of million and  for years ended december  and total revenue total revenue in decreased to million from million in the revenue decrease of million was primarily due to the decrease in freight car sales of million  new and rebuilt cars in vs  new and rebuilt cars in and a million decrease in truck related sales volume at bostrom 
the decreases were offset in part by the inclusion of tci for all of versus inclusion for the partial year of  an increase of million 
as of december   the company s backlog of new and rebuilt freight cars was compared to  new and rebuilt freight cars at december  cost of sales manufacturing and gross profit cost of sales manufacturing for as a percent of manufacturing sales was  compared to in related gross profits were and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit resulted primarily from the acquisition of tci in august tci has historically generated higher gross profits than the freight car business 
partially offsetting this increase was the decrease of gross profit at jac 
jac s gross profit percentage for was down from the prior year approximately percentage point  and the aggregate dollar gross profit was down due to the significant decrease in freight car revenues mentioned above 
selling  general  administrative and amortization expenses selling  general  administrative and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue was and in and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is related to the acquisition and the integration of tci which has higher selling  general and administrative expense levels as a percent of revenue compared to freight car operations  and to increased mis and product development cost at the freight car operations 
amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue was and for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is related to amortization of certain intangible assets and the excess cost over net assets acquired in the tci acquisition 
operating income operating income was million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to including the operating income of tci for all of versus inclusion for the partial year of more than offsetting the drop in operating income at jac 
other interest expense  net was million in compared to million in higher interest expense in resulted from borrowings under the senior bank facilities and the issuance of notes to finance the acquisition of tci  which were outstanding for all of versus four months of in addition  jaix leasing had increased debt levels to finance additional freight cars for the lease fleet 
net loss and diluted loss per share for were million and  respectively  compared to net income and diluted earnings per share of million and  respectively  for liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company provided cash from operations of million compared with million for the company used million of net cash in investing activities during  primarily million used for capital expenditures  and million used for net additions to the leased fleet 
cash provided by financing activities was million for  which included million in proceeds from the issuance of additional senior subordinated notes on august   and increase in the jaix leasing debt of million to fund the leasing fleet additions 
offsetting this increase is the refinancing of million of tranche a senior term debt  scheduled payments of million of debt and payment of million of deferred financing costs 
the company s freight car sales are characterized by large order sizes  specific customer delivery schedules  and related vendor receipts and payment schedules  all of which can combine to create significant fluctuations in working capital when comparing end of period balances 
such fluctuations tend to be of short duration  and the company considers this to be a normal part of its operating cycle which does not significantly impact its financial flexibility and liquidity 
on august   in conjunction with the acquisition of tci and the refinancing of the existing debt of the company  the company and the guarantor subsidiaries entered into the million senior bank facilities and issued million of notes 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for a description of the senior bank facilities and the notes

as of december   there was million of tranche b term loan outstanding under the senior bank facilities  million of notes outstanding  and no borrowings under the million revolving credit line under the senior bank facilities 
availability under the revolving credit line after consideration of outstanding letters of credit of million  was million 
interest payments on the notes and interest and principal payments under the senior bank facilities represent significant cash requirements for the company 
the notes require semiannual interest payments of approximately million 
borrowings under the senior bank facilities bear interest at floating rates and require interest payments on varying dates depending upon the interest rate option selected by the company 
the million of outstanding term tranche b loans requires periodic principal payments through their maturities 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
at december   jaix leasing owned or leased  freight cars 
jaix leasing financed its owned freight cars with a year term loan facility  which as of december   had a balance of million outstanding 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of this facility 
as of december   there was million outstanding under this facility 
the company believes that the cash flow generated from its operations  together with amounts available under the revolving credit line  should be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements  working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures and other operating expenses including expenditures required by applicable environmental laws and regulations 
the company s future operating performance and ability to service or refinance the notes and to extend or refinance the senior bank facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
as of december   the company s balance sheet included cash of million 
environmental and legal matters the company is subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  and will incur additional capital and operating costs in the future to comply with currently existing laws and regulations  new regulatory requirements arising from recently enacted statutes and possible new statutory enactments 
in addition to environmental laws that regulate the company s subsidiaries ongoing operations  the subsidiaries also are subject to environmental remediation liability 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and analogous state laws  the company s subsidiaries may be liable as a result of the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment 
the company s subsidiaries are currently involved in several matters relating to the investigation and or remediation of locations where the subsidiaries have arranged for the disposal of foundry and other wastes 
such matters include five situations in which the company  through its tci subsidiaries and their predecessors  have been named or are believed to be potentially responsible parties prps in the contamination of the sites 
additionally  environmental remediation may be required at two of the tci facilities at which soil and ground water contamination has been identified 
the company believes that it has valid claims for contractual indemnification against prior owners for certain of the investigatory and remedial costs at each of the above mentioned sites 
as a result of the settlement  tci and gunite will not be responsible through a contractual undertaking by the former owner for certain liabilities and costs resulting from gunite s waste disposal prior to the acquisition of gunite by tci in september at certain of such sites 
the company has been notified  however  by certain other contractual indemnitors that they will not honor claims for indemnification 
accordingly  the company is litigating certain indemnification claims and there is no assurance that even if successful in any such claims  any judgments against the indemnitors will ultimately be recoverable 
in addition  the company believes it is likely that it has incurred some liability at various sites for activities and disposal following acquisition which would not in any event be covered by indemnification by prior owners 
as of december   the company has a million environmental reserve 
this reserve is based on current cost estimates and does not reduce estimated expenditures to net present value 
the company currently anticipates spending approximately million in and and million in  and for monitoring the various environmental sites associated with the environmental reserve  including attorney and consultant costs for strategic planning and negotiations with regulators and other prps  and payment of remedial investigation costs 
the company expects to fund such expenditures with the cash flow generated from its operations and amounts available under its revolving loans 
these sites are generally in the early investigatory stages of the remediation process and thus it is anticipated that significant cash payments for remediation will not be incurred for at least several years 
after the evaluation and investigation period  the investigation and remediation costs will likely increase because the actual remediation of the various environmental sites associated with the environmental reserve will likely be under way 
any cash expenditures required by the company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable environmental laws and or to pay for any remediation efforts will not be reduced or otherwise affected by the existence of the environmental reserve 
due to the early stage of investigation of many of the sites and potential remediations referred to above  there are significant uncertainties as to waste quantities involved  the extent and timing of the remediation which will be required  the range of acceptable solutions  costs of remediation and the number of prps contributing to such costs 
based on all of the information presently available to it  the company believes that the environmental reserve will be adequate to cover its future costs related to the sites associated with the environmental reserve  and that any additional costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
however  the discovery of additional sites  the modification of existing laws or regulations  the imposition of joint and several liability under cercla or the uncertainties referred to above could result in such a material adverse effect 
effects of inflation general price inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations
