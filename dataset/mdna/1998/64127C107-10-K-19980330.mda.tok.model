item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations because of the increasing investment of the company in joint ventures jv or jv s which are not consolidated  but accounted for under the equity method  the following comparative schedule is prepared to clarify and demonstrate the consolidated revenue of the company during the periods ending december   and as demonstrated in the schedule  the company s consolidated revenue includes its share of equity in earnings from the jv s amount msi s joint joint venture included in non jv consolidated venture sales net income co s msi revenue revenue revenue vs 
consolidated revenues in increased over  with jv sales increasing and non jv revenues up 
a significant part of the increase in jv sales was attributable to sales of  in colombia   sales in ghana and  in uzbekistan compared to no sales in those countries in cyanco sales increased by  or  over those recorded in joint venture net income from explosive joint ventures was  reflecting a loss of approximately  in the ghana joint venture and earnings of  income from colombia and  from uzbekistan 
msi revenues recorded due to business in colombia during included equity in earnings from the jv of  and direct payments of royalties of  technical fees of  sales of equipment  parts and supplies of  and interest income of  for a total of  other jv s did not produce significant revenues other than that recorded from equity in earnings during during the fourth quarter of  cyanco reduced prices to major customers under cost plus contracts reflecting lower costs of production 
as gold prices declined during  gold mines in nevada attempted to reduce costs to preserve gross margins 
cyanco expects there will be continued pressure on reducing prices of liquid sodium cyanide during also  management does not expect gold producers to make further significant cut backs or announcements in gold production in nevada during unless gold prices decline further 
conversely  management expects gold production to increase if gold prices increase significantly 
consequently  it is expected that cyanco  while attempting to increase its market share  may experience flat sales in cyanco is reviewing cost control measures in its operations and administrative costs 
sales in colombia should increase during due to price increases obtained on january   however  until the transportation facilities are established  as discussed in item  page  production will likely remain at levels experienced during sales in ghana should increase as the company s joint venture seeks to gain more market share in the gold mining districts in ghana 
assuming uzbekistan can stabilize its availability of capital and improve the convertibility of its local currency for imported raw material  sales at turon msi ltd 
could improve substantially in uzbekistan as well 
uzbekistan  to date  has not been able to consistently provide convertibility for companies requiring foreign imports and convertibility for repatriating profits is difficult to obtain without export sales which the company s jv does not currently have 
the company plans on developing export sales by using local profits to invest in capital to support the manufacture of products for export 
msi  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  also expects to show increased foreign sales of accessories and other raw materials during us explosive sales should also increase over sales due to eastern us sales of packaged explosives and improvement in market share in the western us it is expected that sales in canada will remain stable through consolidated gross margins decreased on a percentage basis from to comparing to this was due primarily to high unit costs of production at the company s new emgel r plant in west virginia reflecting development and start up costs 
the company elected to expense all of the development related costs in resulting in a loss of approximately  at the west virginia plant 
during the first half of  the operations at the west virginia plant should reach the breakeven point and be marginally proftitable in it is expected that the emgel r plant prototype and processing know how garnered in can be marketed effectively during in several market niches worldwide 
raw material costs should be reduced or remain stable during and it is expected that there will be no major supply problems 
depreciation is primarily included in costs of sales and increased in by  over that in primarily due to the emgel r plant improvements made in depreciation of the emgel r plant in future years will reflect the increased depreciation of the improvements made in and general and administrative costs incurred in increased by approximately  or over those in primarily due to employee costs 
income before provision for income taxes for was up by over reflecting increased income from continuing operations in which improved by  or over  proceeds from settlement of litigation of approximately  and gain on sales of assets and net interest income of approximately  the effective tax rate increased from in to in it is expected that during income from operations will begin to reflect increases in jv operations in explosives and that gross margins contributed from us and canadian explosives business will improve as the west virginia operation achieves normal production 
this anticipated growth in earnings will be partially offset by a higher effective tax rate during as most of the carried over tax benefits were used during vs 
total revenues for the company showed an increase between and this was due to the increase of msi s revenue attributable to its share of equity earnings from jv s which in was primarily derived from cyanco 
a major low margin account of msi was discontinued in the west early in net income of  for increased by approximately  or nearly over that earned in pre tax earnings increased from  in to  in which represents an increase 
the increases in earnings was due primarily from equity earnings from operations at cyanco 
liquidity and financial resources the company ended with the strongest financial position in its history 
cash flow from operating activities was  during compared to  during  an improvement of about 
the current ratio  a measure of current liquidity  in the company improved during from at the end of to at the end of long term debt existing at the end of which was primarily made up of certain leases of mobile equipment was paid off during deferred taxes were increased from  to  reflecting primarily the increased tax depreciation on the added plant and equipment at cyanco and west virginia 
receivables by the end of had increased  over this increase was due in part to delayed payments of royalties which were received in january in the amount of approximately   from settlement of litigation and  primarily due to slow paying accounts which were substantially brought current by february it is expected that increases of cash flow from operating activities should continue to increase during net cash used in investing activities decreased from  in to  in cash needed for investing activities during likely will continue in ghana  uzbekistan and in north american operations 
it is also anticipated that several announcements will be made during regarding additional joint ventures and business arrangements which will require additional capital 
it is expected that cash needed for investment during will be provided from operations 
the company has a bank revolving line of credit in the amount of  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate secured by receivables and inventory  an equipment line of credit of  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate secured by equipment and a working capital line of credit for  at the bank s prime rate secured by the corporate office building 
each line of credit matures on may  at the end of none of the lines of credit were utilized 
it is expected that the lines of credit will be renewed during may because of inflation associated with third world countries where the company invests  there exists a substantial risk that the value of investments in those jurisdictions may erode 
also  the internal balance of payments and capital shortages in some of those countries  particularly uzbekistan  may temporarily limit the ability to convert local currencies into hard currency necessary for importing raw materials or remitting profits 
management intends to use appropriate transfer pricing  investments in hedges  loans and other credit facilities to minimize the risks inherent in doing business in these countries 
the company continues to pursue its policy of investing with government entities or stable international and us companies as its partners to help insure its long term success
