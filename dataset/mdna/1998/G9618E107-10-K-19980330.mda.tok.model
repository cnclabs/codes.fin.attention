losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged against income as incurred 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates by claims adjusters  legal counsel and actuarial staff of the ultimate costs of settling claims  including the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent management s best estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses net of estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operations 
the process of estimating loss and loss adjustment expenses involves a considerable degree of judgement by management and the ultimate amount of expense to be incurred could be considerably greater than or less than the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements 
in the normal course of business  valley  charter and wmic seek to limit losses that may arise from catastrophes or other events that may cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
valley  charter and wmic remain contingently liable for risks reinsured with third parties to the extent that the reinsurer is unable to honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts at the time of loss 
while there may be greater individual risks of loss associated with nonstandard automobile insurance than with standard automobile insurance eg  higher loss frequency  the insurance premiums charged in consideration of these additional risk characteristics are generally higher than those of standard automobile coverage and in many cases  if the coverage is properly underwritten  the risk to rate characteristics of writing nonstandard automobile insurance are at least equal to or more favorable than that of standard automobile coverage 
additionally  nonstandard automobile individual liability limits are generally lower than those of standard automobile coverages which results in the amount of individual losses being less volatile eg  lower loss severity 
in general  loss costs for nonstandard automobile insurance are  in fact  more predictable than those for several other lines of property and casualty insurance eg  medical malpractice or umbrella liability coverages
