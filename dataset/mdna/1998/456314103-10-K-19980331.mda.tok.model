in  the registrant derived all its ferrous scrap and paper recycling revenue from the management contract arrangement with k r 
the contract business comprised  and of the registrant s income before provision for income tax for the years ended december   and the registrant has reduced its relative profit dependence further by the asset purchase of the metal center  thereby diversifying into the non ferrous business on july  results of operations the following table presents  for the years indicated  the percentage relationship which certain captioned items in the registrant s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues and other pertinent data year ended december  statements of operations data total revenue cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the revenue in was  representing an increase of  or compared to the revenue from the newly acquired the metal center is included for six months and represented of the overall growth 
the major products include recycling of copper  aluminum and brass  referred to herein as non ferrous scrap 
except for equipment and corrugated recycling  all other existing businesses had solid growth contributing the remaining of the total 
one of the major contributors to the remaining growth was the ferrous recycling business  which includes iron and steel products 
recycling revenues grew to  through an increase in direct sales to mills and more aggressive purchasing practices 
the management services business grew to  by increasing the same account and new account business serviced from approximately  locations on december  to  locations on december  in addition  the management services business absorbed approximately additional locations from mgm in the last quarter 
the total cost of sales was  increasing  or compared to the cost of goods sold in management services increased by verses an increase in recycling cost of goods sold of 
this divergence was caused by the addition of the non ferrous business  which has typically a lower gross profit percentage than the existing business base 
secondly  the ferrous business spreads narrowed due to competitive pressures 
finally  the corrugated recycling business  while the most profitable product line in recycling and which showed an improved percentage gross margin in  experienced a drop in revenue during the equipment division had cost of goods sold of  or less in versus this cost decrease compares with a revenue decrease of 
the business experienced a cost decrease in equipment sales to approximately  while experiencing a increase in rental leasing 
the registrant has focused on the growth of the rental leasing portion of its business 
the gross margin was  representing a decrease of  in or from the gross margin was of revenue  which was lower than a reduced gross margin percentage of was experienced in management services due to some fixed fee contracts which experienced store location growth during the year 
finally  the recycling division experienced a gross profit decrease due to the new mix of non ferrous products and narrowing spreads on the ferrous products  and lower volume of corrugated scrap processing 
the equipment business had higher gross margin percentage  due to a favorable mix of higher rental and leasing business relative to equipment sales 
the selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased  as compared to as a percent of revenue  the selling  general and administrative dropped from of revenue to 
financial condition at december  compared to december  trade accounts receivable increased  to  at december  last year the registrant received a december receivable payment of  at year end  and as a result of this timing difference  trade receivables decreased from  to  therefore  the adjusted increase as of december  was  which represented a increase in this increase is significantly less than the increase in revenue  reflecting management focus on working capital through the liquidation of accounts receivable 
inventory increased  or to  of the total increase  equipment increased  and the non ferrous scrap inventory increased  due primarily to the new non ferrous operation 
the remaining increase was due to the purchase of a major ferrous scrap plant rework  which occurred at the end of the year  resulting in a temporary increase in ferrous unprocessed scrap inventory 
accounts payable trade increased  from december  to  as of december  this increase was due to higher volumes in all areas of the registrant s operations except corrugated paper 
as of december   the registrant s working capital was a deficit of  which represents a  decrease from the total current assets increased  due to the  increase in inventory  and the increase in total receivables of  offset by impact of the lower cash of  the current liabilities increased  affected primarily by total accounts payable increases of  and additional short term bank borrowings of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased from  in to  in this increase in revenue is the result of i an increase of  in cws operations and ii an increase in volume related to the scrap recycling operations and corrugated paper recycling operations  which offset the decrease in market prices in as compared to rental income increased from  in to  in due to an increase in the number of equipment units leased by the registrant to customers 
recycling sales experienced a moderate increase of  or to  in cost of goods sold increased  or  from  in to  in as a percentage of revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
this increase was directly related to an increase in cws operations of  recycling cost of goods sold increased from  in to  in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in these expenses decreased from to of revenue in and  respectively

expenses to related parties decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to the change in the management agreement between the registrant and k r allowing the registrant to retain commencing in rather than prior to of the profits generated from the k r operations 
the commissions expense related to this agreement decreased from  in to  in rent expense decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to the registrant purchasing operational equipment partially funded through the bank credit facility rather than leasing such equipment from k r 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not and is not expected to have a significant impact on the registrant s operation in the near term 
the registrant has no long term fixed price contracts and the registrant believes it will be able to pass through most cost increases resulting from inflation to its customers 
impact of recently issued accounting standards reporting comprehensive income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
the sfas establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in financial statements 
year risk factors in february  the registrant implemented its year project to address the potential problem with which substantially all users of automated data processing and information systems must deal 
this problem is mainly with older systems with only two digits to represent the year  rather than the full four digits 
older computer systems may not operate when the two digit year becomes as will happen in the year the registrant uses primarily microsoft software  which is already year compliant 
our accounting system is a dos based system  which could create the problem with 
the registrant in its endeavor to alleviate this dos based problem has contracted with the programmer of the registrant to write software to prevent this potential problem 
the software upgrade has just been completed  and the registrant will test the program to verify all is in working order 
by having the upgrade this far in advance it will enable the registrant to run a test system to avert any future problem 
the only software that the registrant uses that is beyond its control is edi or electronic data interchange 
the vendor of this software used by the registrant and many fortune companies  has promised a fix for this problem with its spring release software upgrade 
this area is the one over which the registrant has the least control 
if edi completes its upgrade as promised the registrant does not anticipate a year problem with this software 
in summary  the registrant s year project s goal and expectation are that all necessary modifications and upgrades will be in place at minimum one year in advance  with the exception of edi that is promised by the vendor in spring the registrant currently has no reason to believe and does not anticipate the cost of year compliance to be a significant expense or problem 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the registrant will bear some minimal risk due to customers who fail to address the issues appropriately  or should the one vendor fail to meet the spring deadline 
presently  the registrant has no reason to believe that any of its customers are failing to take appropriate action to effect year compliance or that its software will be unable to perform as before with the upgrades
