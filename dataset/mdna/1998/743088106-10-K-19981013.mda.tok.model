orders which were received  and the delivery dates of the orders  tended to be concentrated over a shorter period of time  hindering the ability of atlas management to schedule production and use labor optimally 
this increased atlas s costs and reduced profit margins on shipments

atlas borrowed from  to  under the revolver during fiscal use of the revolver depends on project invoicing 
delays in converting work in process into customer invoices typically require increases in revolver borrowings 
from time to time  atlas s bank allows for temporary increases in the collateral requirements as stated in the current agreement 
the debt to officers under the bonus restructuring plan is subordinated to bank borrowings and is included in calculating certain debt ratios as required by covenants in the banking agreements 
the company s working capital at june  was  compared to  as of june  the decrease was due primarily to the  repayment on the revolving credit line and an increase of  in expenditures for property and equipment 
at june   atlas had borrowings outstanding of  on various loans and the deferred compensation agreement  of which the current portion was  atlas s loans and deferred compensation agreement were comprised of the following i a revolving credit agreement expiring in september  with increased maximum debt usage of  based on collateral including atlas receivables  work in process  and other assets

contingencies atlas is undergoing an internal revenue service audit for the fiscal year ended june  the main area of review is a research and experimentation tax credit the company has calculated and filed for over the past six years 
the company had applied approximately  of credit towards federal taxes due for the fiscal periods ended june   and and had a carry forward of approximately  expected to be used as a reduction in future tax payments 
management believes this issue is a matter of interpretation of the research and experimentation regulations 
management believes that the irs may seek a reduction in the amount of credit calculated which may have an adverse effect to the financial statements of the company 
the company is entitled to indemnification up to  subject to certain exclusions and limitations from the former principal stockholders of atlas for amounts it may be required to pay as a result of such audit 
year compliance the company is installing an enterprise resource planning system at atlas  which includes computer systems for its internal accounting and reporting activities and its manufacturing operations and processes which are year compliant which means that such computer systems and other information technology will accurately process date time data regardless of whether the date is in the twentieth or twenty first century 
the acquisition and installation of the system are expected to cost approximately  of which  was expended in fiscal because the system is being implemented as an overall upgrade to atlas s operations and not specifically to address year compliance concerns  management has not estimated the portion of the cost which may be allocable to year compliance 
management has not yet assessed whether or not the failure of atlas s internal information technology to be year compliant would have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations although it is confident that installation and operation of the new system will be accomplished in advance of december  the company is also assessing its vendors  customers  utilities  banks and others with whom it does business to determine if their failure to be year compliant would have a material adverse effect upon the company or its financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
to date  nothing has come to the attention of management that leads it to conclude that the likelihood of such adverse effect reasonably exists 
the company s and atlas s operations utilize relatively little electronic data interchange with vendors  customers and other third parties 
however  to the extent that such third parties  particularly utilities and banks  may not be year compliant  the company and atlas may be adversely effected  although the magnitude of such effect cannot be estimated 
the cost to the company of making its third party year compliance assessment is not expected to be material 
certain atlas products contain processors which address and utilize date time data 
management believes that such processors incorporated in equipment sold within the past five years are virtually all year compliant 
however  it is not able to determine the compliance status of processors used in equipment sold in earlier periods with any reasonable degree of certainty 
although such equipment is beyond the warranty periods applicable to atlas s products  it is possible that customers who purchased equipment from atlas which is not year compliant may nevertheless assert claims against atlas to correct the compliance deficiencies or for resulting damages 
while management believes that atlas would not be legally responsible to such persons  based on the terms of its purchase orders and warranties  there can be no assurance that this position would prevail if challenged 
management is unable to estimate the potential cost that the company might incur if such claims are made and successfully sustained or whether or not such cost would have a material adverse effect upon its financial position  liquidity or results of operations
