the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the financial statements of the company  which present the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
for the periods presented prior to the distribution date  the historical financial statements include the assets  liabilities  income and expenses that were directly related to the contributed businesses as they were operated within parent 
in the case of assets and liabilities not specifically allocable to any particular business of parent  only those assets and liabilities owned by the company after the distribution were included in the company s separate balance sheets 
regardless of the allocation of these assets and liabilities  however  the company s statement of operations includes all of the related costs of doing business  including charges for the use of facilities and for employee benefits  and includes an allocation of certain general corporate expenses of parent which were not directly related to the contributed businesses  including costs for corporate logistics  corporate research and development  information technologies  finance  legal and corporate executives 
these allocations were based on a number of factors including  for example  personnel  space  time and effort  and sales volume 
management believes these allocations as well as the assumptions underlying the development of the company s separate financial statements to be reasonable 
the consolidated financial statements for all periods subsequent to the distribution date reflect the results of operations  financial position  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the independent company 
the financial information included herein for periods prior to the distribution date may not  however  necessarily reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company as it would have been had the company been a separate  stand alone entity during these periods 
this is due  in part  to the historical operation of the company as an integral part of the larger parent 
following the distribution  the company became a stand alone entity with objectives and strategies separate from those of parent

liquidity and capital resources simultaneously with the distribution  parent contributed  in cash and cash equivalents to the company for use in the company s business 
net cash used in operations during fiscal was  which included a net loss of  partially offset by items not requiring cash 
in an effort to improve cash flow  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took measures to lower its operating expenses by implementing a workforce reduction of approximately  began subletting excess office capacity  and has recently lowered operating expenses including  but not limited to  sales and marketing expenses for all of its product lines 
taking into consideration these efforts  the company believes that current available funds will be sufficient to meet current operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if such efforts are unsuccessful in improving cash flow and the company s liquidity position materially worsens  the company may need to secure external financing in order to meet its ongoing capital requirements 
consequently  the company is pursuing possible financing alternatives but  there can be no assurance whether the company would be successful in obtaining any required external financing 
impact of year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is in the process of conducting an assessment of its computer information systems and is beginning to take the necessary steps to determine the nature and extent of the work required to make its systems year compliant  where necessary 
these steps will require the company to modify  upgrade or replace some of its internal financial and operational systems 
the company continues to evaluate the estimated cost of bringing all internal systems  equipment and operations into year compliance  but has not yet finished determining the total cost of these compliance efforts 
while these efforts will involve additional costs  the company believes  based upon currently available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  if these efforts are not completed on time  or if the cost of updating or replacing the company s information systems exceeds the company s current estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company also intends to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to any failures by its major suppliers  distributors and service providers to remedy their own year issues  and is in the process of initiating formal communications with these parties 
at this time the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party suppliers  distributors and service providers to achieve year compliance  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any material shipment delays from its major product suppliers or any material sales delays from its major distributors due to year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that these third parties will not experience year problems or that any problems would not have a material effect on the company s product supply and distribution channels 
because the cost and timing of year compliance by third parties such as suppliers  distributors and service providers is not within the company s control  no assurance can be given with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or any potential adverse effects on the company of any failure by these third parties to achieve year compliance
