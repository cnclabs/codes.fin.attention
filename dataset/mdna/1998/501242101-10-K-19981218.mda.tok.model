item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements contained in this discussion are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  as amended the exchange act  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the statute 
such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements that relate to the company s future revenue  product development  demand  competitiveness  gross margins  operating expenses  management s plans and objectives for current and future operations of the company and the effects of the company s current resizing efforts 
such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties  including those discussed below and under the heading risk factors within this section and in the company s reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
introduction and company outlook the company s operating results primarily depend upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile and has experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including assembly equipment manufactured and marketed by the company and  to a lesser extent  packaging materials such as those sold by the company 
these downturns and slowdowns have also adversely affected the company s operating results  in particular  during the latter half of fiscal and fiscal the company does not consider its business to be seasonal in nature 
the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in fiscal due to the ongoing financial turmoil in asia  which has impacted the financial resources available to some of the company s asian customers and cut demand for end user products that use semiconductors  to a slowdown in the rate of growth of personal computer pc sales  and a surplus of assembly capacity 
the company expects the lower level of industry wide assembly equipment purchases to continue  at least through the second quarter of fiscal  which is expected to result in the company reporting net losses in the first quarters of its fiscal in fiscal  the company continued its transition to a new generation of wire bonders  the family  which is based on an entirely new platform and which has required a significant amount of resources to be devoted to the development of new software and subassemblies 
the first products of the family  the model ball bonder and model wedge bonder  accounted for and  respectively  of total fiscal company sales of ball bonders and wedge bonders 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the model ball bonder accounted for of total company sales of ball bonders 
the company continues to devote resources to enhance the model and and to introduce new family machines 
the company also continues to sell its existing supply of wire bonder machines 
in february  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronics corporation delco to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis and to license related technologies through flip chip technologies  llc fct 
fct completed construction of its manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona in fiscal  has commenced production  and is currently working with customers to have its manufacturing processes qualified 
this qualification process is expected to continue throughout fiscal fct has experienced losses since its inception 
the company has recognized its proportionate share of such losses based on its equity interest  including losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company currently expects fct will incur additional losses during fiscal see the risk factors section of item and the financial statements of fct in item of this report for a detailed discussion of the company s financial commitments to fct  the company s desire to convert its outstanding loans to fct into equity units thereby increasing its ownership share of fct and the financial performance of fct 
results of operations fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded bookings totaling million compared to million during fiscal the million decrease in fiscal bookings primarily reflected an industry wide slowdown in orders for semiconductor assembly equipment 
at september   total backlog of customer orders approximated million compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  the company s backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
net sales for the fiscal year decreased by million to million from million in fiscal the lower sales volume generally reflected the slowdown in the semiconductor industry resulting in reduced demand for semiconductor assembly equipment and to a lesser extent packaging materials 
the majority of the reduction in net sales was in the company s equipment segment where net sales decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fewer unit sales of ball bonders approximately  ball bonders were sold in fiscal compared to over  in fiscal were partially offset by higher unit sales of wedge bonders resulting in the lower equipment segment sales in fiscal packaging materials segment net sales decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the lower package material segment net sales was due primarily to lower average selling prices of bonding wire as the result of lower prevailing gold prices in fiscal compared to fiscal international sales shipments of the company s products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of the company s total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong  accounted for approximately and of the company s total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  shipments to customers located in taiwan  philippines  malaysia and korea accounted for approximately   and of net sales  compared to   and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
the most significant change in foreign destination sales occurred in korea  where korean based customers which have historically accounted for a significant percentage of company sales  were adversely affected by the financial turmoil in that country and as a result  reduced their orders to the company 
the company expects sales to korean based customers to remain at reduced levels in fiscal gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the lower unit volume of equipment segment sales in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  due to lower gross profit margin in the equipment segment partially offset by higher gross profit margin in the packaging materials segment 
the equipment segment gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to the lower unit volume which resulted in the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs by fewer units 
the packaging materials segment gross profit margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due primarily to improved manufacturing efficiencies at its bonding wire and saw blade facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase of million consisted of approximately million related to the equipment segment  
million related to the packaging materials segment and 
million of incremental corporate costs 
the increase in the equipment segment sg a was due primarily to increased selling  marketing and customer support costs associated with the launch of the new model and wire bonders and increased spending in connection with the planned implementation of the company s new enterprise resource planning system  which will replace the segment s business and accounting systems 
the slight increase in the package materials sg a costs in fiscal was due to higher sales and distribution infrastructure costs 
research and development costs r d increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the r d costs incurred were in the equipment segment and were due to increased internal labor  higher outside contract development costs and increased expenditures for prototype materials as the company continued development of additional products in the family of wire bonders 
the company also continues to invest in new technologies which may eventually lead to improved and alternative semiconductor assembly technologies 
gross r d expenditures were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company recorded resizing costs of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal reflecting the company s efforts to reduce its workforce and discontinue products in response to the industry wide slowdown in orders for semiconductor assembly equipment and to a lesser extent semiconductor packaging materials 
the resizing costs consisted of million of severance  million of asset write offs associated with discontinued products and 
million of other liabilities associated with the resizing see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at september   the company had accrued liabilities of million in connection with the resizing charges  the majority of which will be paid by the end of fiscal the company expects additional resizing charges in the first quarter of fiscal of less than million and  if industry conditions do not improve  may incur additional resizing charges in subsequent quarters of fiscal loss from operations in fiscal was million compared to operating income of million in fiscal the unfavorable variance to fiscal was due primarily to lower unit sales volume and gross profit in the company s equipment segment and to resizing charges  both the result of the slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
partially off setting the lower operating income in the equipment segment was a million improvement in operating income in the company s packaging materials segment  excluding resizing charges 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the investment of net proceeds from the company s may public offering of common stock for a full year in fiscal compared to a partial year in fiscal and to the paydown of all outstanding bank debt with a portion of the proceeds of the public offering in may during fiscal  the company recognized an million pre tax loss from its equity interest in fct compared to a pre tax loss of million in fiscal the increase in the loss in fiscal resulted from delays in potential customers evaluations of fct s manufacturing process and the generally soft business environment in the semiconductor industry  along with a ramp up of fct s production facility 
see the discussion of fct under the risk factors section of this item and the financial statements in item for further information regarding fct 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate of this benefit was  resulting from us pre tax losses exceeding foreign pre tax income that was taxed at lower rates 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the acquired domestic afw net operating loss nol and nol carryforwards of the company s japanese subsidiary  since the company cannot reasonably forecast sufficient future earnings by these subsidiaries to fully utilize the nol s during the carryforward period 
if benefits of the acquired nol carryforward are realized  such tax benefits would reduce the recorded amount of afw goodwill 
the net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year  the company recorded bookings totaling million compared to million during fiscal the million increase in fiscal equipment bookings primarily reflected a significant improvement in demand for semiconductor assembly equipment  principally gold ball bonders  compared to the declining demand experienced throughout fiscal at september   total backlog of customer orders approximated million compared to million at september  net sales for the fiscal year increased by million to million from million in fiscal this improvement generally reflected a reversal of the fiscal trend of declining quarterly sales 
equipment segment net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  the company sold more than  ball bonders compared to slightly more than  units during fiscal additionally  increased unit sales of automatic dicing saws contributed to the fiscal increase 
these volume increases were offset  in part  by lower selling prices for the model plus ball bonder line compared to the average selling prices realized on ball bonders during fiscal  and by reduced unit sales of the model sp tab bonder in fiscal compared to fiscal packaging materials segment net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to sales of hub blades following the october semitec acquisition and million was due to increased sales volume of bonding wire  which was offset  in part  by the effect on revenues of declining gold prices 
international sales shipments of the company s products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of the company s total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong  accounted for approximately and of the company s total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  total shipments including export sales to customers located in taiwan  korea and malaysia accounted for approximately  and of net sales  compared to  and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to the fiscal increased unit volume of equipment sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  with declines being experienced in both the equipment and packaging materials segments 
the equipment segment gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to lower average selling prices on ball bonders and reduced fiscal sales of higher margin upgrade kits and accessories compared to fiscal levels 
the packaging materials segment gross profit margin declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal a shift in sales mix to lower margin wire products in fiscal was the primary reason for this decline 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase of million consisted of approximately million related to the equipment segment  million related to the packaging materials segment and 
million of incremental corporate costs 
fiscal sg a costs included incremental costs resulting from the october semitec acquisition  generally higher employment costs related to the increased sales volume  higher sales and management incentive compensation costs due to improved fiscal sales and profitability and costs incurred to relocate the company s micro swiss and afw singapore manufacturing operations into new facilities during the year 
the impact of these increases was offset  in part  by certain non recurring equipment segment and corporate costs incurred in connection with the company s august resizing initiatives 
research and development costs r d decreased to million in fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the r d costs incurred were in the equipment segment  and reflected lower outside contract development costs and lower expenditures for prototype materials 
during fiscal  the company continued to invest heavily in the development of the series wire bonders and the enhancement of many of its existing products  including  but not limited to  the model plus ball bonder and model fp wedge bonder  to enable them to meet customer requirements for higher lead count devices with finer pitch requirements at faster bonding speeds 
the company also continues to invest in new technologies which may eventually lead to improved and alternative semiconductor assembly technologies 
gross r d expenditures were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal income from operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this improvement resulted principally from the higher net sales and gross profit in the equipment segment  offset  in part  by the increased operating expenses noted above 
the packaging materials segment operating income declined to a break even level in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily reflecting costs incurred in fiscal to relocate the micro swiss and afw singapore operations to new facilities  severance costs and incremental costs to expand the packaging materials marketing and distribution organizations 
interest income  net of interest expense increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the investment of net proceeds from the company s may public offering of common stock 
during fiscal  the company recognized a million loss from its equity interest in fct compared to a loss of million in fiscal the increase in the loss in fiscal resulted from a full year of start up activities during fiscal compared to only a partial year of early start up activities during fiscal the company s effective tax rate increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase resulted largely from an increase in income attributable to operations in the united states 
this increase was offset in part by the reversal of valuation allowances established in prior years related to us tax credits 
net income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas no 
 which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
the comprehensive income and related cumulative equity impact of comprehensive income items will be required to be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
only the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale are expected to be disclosed as potential additional components of the company s income under the requirements of sfas no 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
fas supersedes fas  financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  replacing the industry segment approach with the management approach 
the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company s reportable segments 
fas also requires disclosure about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of fas did not affect results of operations or financial position but did affect the disclosure of segment information see note to the company s consolidated financial statements herein 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas was issued 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters for financial statements for fiscal years commencing after june  management has not completed its review of sfas and has not determined the impact adoption will have on the company s financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   cash and investments totaled million compared to million at september   additionally  the company has a total of million available under a bank revolving credit facility  which expires in march borrowings are subject to the company s compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the revolving credit documents 
at september   the company was in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility and had no borrowings outstanding under that facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings denominated in either us dollars or foreign currencies 
borrowings in us dollars bear interest either at a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate minus or the federal funds rate plus or  at a libor rate defined as libor plus 
to 
depending on the company s leverage ratio 
foreign currency borrowings bear interest at a libor rate  as defined above  applicable to the foreign currency 
during the past three fiscal years  the company has financed its operations principally through cash flows from operations 
cash generated by operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal the lower cash generated from operating activities was primarily the result of the net loss recorded by the company in fiscal due to the lower unit sales volume in the company s equipment segment 
at september   working capital was million compared to million at september  the lower working capital was due primarily to a million reduction in accounts receivable reflecting the significantly reduced sales volume during the latter half of fiscal  partially offset by lower trade accounts payable of million also reflecting the lower sales and  therefore  production volume in the latter half of fiscal during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in property and equipment  primarily for retooling of its equipment manufacturing facilities for the transition to the series of machines  an increase in capacity for the packaging and materials business and upgrading computer hardware and software systems in connection with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system erps which will become operational in fiscal the company presently expects fiscal capital spending to approximate million 
the principal capital projects planned for fiscal include the purchase of additional tooling and equipment necessary to enhance and manufacture the series of machines  additional increases in manufacturing capacity for the packaging and materials business segment and additional investments in the new erps 
pursuant to the terms of the fct joint venture agreement  the company made capital contributions of million through september  in addition  the company entered into three separate loan agreements totaling million with fct during fiscal and as of september   million had been loaned to fct under these loan agreements 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the remaining million was borrowed by fct 
additionally  the company and fct entered into a fourth loan agreement  whereby  the company committed to loan up to an additional million to fct during fiscal and advanced to fct under this fourth agreement 
the loans bear interest at the prime rate plus 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company gave notice to fct of its desire to convert the loans  together with accrued interest  into equity units 
see the risk factors section of this item for a further discussion of fct 
the company entered into a joint venture agreement  in september  to develop  manufacture and market advanced polymer materials for semiconductor and microelectronic packaging end users 
the company has committed to invest up to million in this joint venture 
the company believes that anticipated cash flows from operations  its working capital and amounts available under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  the company may seek  as required  equity or debt financing to provide capital for corporate purposes and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions and competitive factors and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which the company may elect to pursue 
risk factors semiconductor industry volatility the company s operating results primarily depend upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile and has experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including assembly equipment manufactured and marketed by the company and  to a lesser extent  packaging materials such as those sold by the company 
these downturns and slowdowns have also adversely affected the company s operating results and the company believes that such volatility will continue to characterize the industry and to impact the company s operations in the future 
product concentration a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from sales of a relatively small number of machines  most with selling prices ranging from  to over  a delay in the shipment of a limited quantity of machines  either due to manufacturing delays or to rescheduling or cancellations of customer orders  could have a material adverse effect on the results of the operations for any particular fiscal year or quarter 
rapid technology change the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries are subject to rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company believes that its continued success will depend upon the extent to which it is able to continuously develop and manufacture or otherwise acquire new products and product enhancements and to introduce them into the market in response to demands for higher performance assembly equipment 
new product introduction the company incurred incremental costs in fiscal and is likely to incur additional costs during the customer evaluation and qualification process of the company s newly introduced family of wire bonders to ensure the functionality and reliability of these new products 
the company s inability to successfully qualify new products  or its inability to manufacture and ship these products in volume and on a timely basis  could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
furthermore  to the extent the company fails to accurately forecast demand in volume and configuration for both its current and next generation wire bonders and generally to manage product transitions successfully  it could experience reduced orders  delays in product shipments and increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce and manufacture new products  that new products introduced by the company will be accepted in the marketplace or that the company will manage its product transitions successfully 
the company s failure to do any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on key customers sales to a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  sales to intel accounted for of the company s net sales 
during fiscal  sales to anam a korean based customer and intel accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
during fiscal  sales to anam and intel accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
sales to these and other customers might be affected by a number of factors including the transition from conventional assembly techniques to alternative methods of semiconductor assembly for future generation products 
the timing of such a transition and the impact on the company  if any  can not be determined at this time 
in the event a current customer would transition to an alternative method  the company s failure to acquire replacement customers for its equipment business could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
dependence on key suppliers the company relies on subcontractors to produce to the company s specifications many of the materials  components or subassemblies used in its products 
certain of the company s products  however  require components or assemblies of an exceptionally high degree of reliability  accuracy and performance 
currently there are a number of such items for which there are only a single or limited number of suppliers which have been accepted by the company as qualified suppliers 
the company generally does not maintain long term contracts with its subcontractors and suppliers 
while the company does not believe that its business is substantially dependent on any contract or arrangement with any of its subcontractors or suppliers  the company s reliance on subcontractors and single source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including the loss of control over the manufacturing process  the potential absence of adequate capacity and the reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs 
further  certain of the company s subcontractors and suppliers are relatively small operations and have limited financial and manufacturing resources 
in the event that any significant subcontractor or single source supplier were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or sell subassemblies  components or parts to the company in required volumes and of acceptable quality levels and prices  the company would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
the process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers could be lengthy  and no assurance can be given that any additional sources would be available to the company on a timely basis 
sales to foreign customers most of the company s foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  and the company believes that the increase in value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in fiscal has made the company s products more expensive in relation to products offered by certain of the company s foreign competitors 
in addition  a majority of the company s sales are to customers with operations in the asia pacific region which has been adversely affected by economic turmoil 
there can be no assurance that selling prices of future orders or that the economic problems that persist in the asia pacific region will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
dependence on key personnel the future success of the company is dependent upon its ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees 
competition in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry is intense  particularly with respect to certain engineering disciplines 
the inability for the company to continue to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
intellectual property from time to time  third parties assert that the company is  or may be  infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights 
in such cases  the company will defend against claims or negotiate licenses where considered appropriate 
in addition  certain of the company s customers have received notices of infringement from the lemelson medical  education and research foundation limited partnership the lemelson foundation  alleging that equipment supplied by the company  and processes performed by such equipment  infringe on patents held by the lemelson foundation 
this activity increased substantially in  since in june of this year the lemelson foundation settled its suit against the ford motor company  and entered into license agreements with ford  gm and chrysler 
since then a number of the company s customers  including intel  have been sued by the lemelson foundation 
certain customers have requested that the company defend and indemnify them against the claims of the lemelson foundation or to contribute to any settlement the customer reaches with the lemelson foundation 
to date  however  no customer who has settled with the lemelson foundation has  after settlement  sought contribution from the company 
the company has received opinions from its outside patent counsel with respect to certain of the lemelson foundation patents 
the company is not aware that any equipment marketed by the company  or process performed by such equipment infringe on the lemelson foundation patents in question and does not believe that the lemelson foundation matter or any other pending intellectual property claim will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or operating results 
however  the ultimate outcome of any infringement or misappropriation claim affecting the company is uncertain and there can be no assurances that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
volatility of common stock price the market price for the company s common stock has been volatile and it could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to market or industry conditions generally  or specific variations in quarterly operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and other factors  such as announcements of reductions in force  departure of key employees  introduction of new products by the company or by the company s competitors  disruptions with key customers or the occurrence of political  economic or environmental events globally or in key sales regions 
in addition  the stock market has in recent years experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies whose stocks are traded 
recent fluctuations affecting the company s common stock have been tied in part to the asian financial crisis and the price of semiconductors 
broad market fluctuations  as well as economic conditions generally in the semiconductor industry  may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
investment in flip chip technologies  llc in february  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronics corporation delco providing for the formation and management of flip chip technologies  llc fct 
fct was formed to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis and to license related technologies 
the company owns a equity interest in fct but participates equally with delco in the management of fct through an executive committee 
accordingly  the company accounts for its investment in fct using the equity method  and recognizes its proportionate share of the operating results of the joint venture on the basis of its ownership interest 
through september   the company had contributed million of capital and had loaned million to fct pursuant to three revolving loan agreements 
subsequent to september  the company signed a fourth revolving loan agreement for up to million and committed to provide additional funding  if required  in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal fct borrowed the remaining million available under loans issued prior to september  and borrowed million under the fourth loan agreement 
the loans bear interest at the prime rate plus at september  and are secured by fct s accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment 
the loans are due on various dates through november  with interest payable generally upon maturity 
the loans are convertible  at the company s option  into additional equity units of fct 
under these agreements delco also has certain rights  to purchase additional equity units of fct 
on november   the company notified delco of its desire to convert the outstanding loans into additional equity units of fct  subject to an appraisal of fct and the value of an equity unit 
until the appraisal is completed and the conversion valuation is determined the company cannot be certain as to if or when the conversion of the outstanding loans to fct equity units will take place 
however  due to uncertainties surrounding fct s ability to obtain additional financing from delco and its ability to generate short term positive cash flow  the company expects that beginning in fiscal it will recognize of the operating results of fct in its financial statements and it will not record interest income from its loans to fct 
as a result of delays in the customers evaluations of fct s manufacturing process and the generally soft business environment in the semiconductor industry  fct has not generated substantial operating revenues to date 
the company is currently working with fct management to balance fct s planned expense and spending levels with available financial resources but expects fct to report a loss from operations in fiscal the joint venture is subject to numerous risks common to business arrangements of this nature 
there can be no assurance that fct will ever become profitable  that the company will make additional capital contributions and loans to fct  or that the anticipated benefits of fct will ever be realized 
if fct does not become profitable and cash flow positive  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
year the year compliance issue in which systems do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to create risks for the company if internal data management  accounting and or manufacturing or operating software and systems do not adequately or accurately process or manage day or date information beyond the year  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
to address the issue  the company created an internal task force to assess its state of readiness for possible year issues and take the necessary actions to ensure year compliance 
the task force has and continues to evaluate internal business systems  software and other components which affect the performance of company s products  and the company s vulnerability to possible year exposures due to suppliers and other third parties lack of preparedness for the year to evaluate certain equipment sold by the company and certain equipment  tools and software used by the company  the company employs year readiness test scenarios established by sematech  an industry group comprised of us semiconductor manufacturers 
based on this assessment  the company does not believe operation of such equipment will be affected by the transition to the year the company expects that its review  corrective measures and contingency planning where necessary will be complete by september in connection with its review and corrective measures  the company is currently in the process of replacing the business and accounting systems of its equipment manufacturing sites in the us and israel with a new enterprise resource planning system erps which is year compliant 
as of september   the company has spent approximately million in hardware  software  consulting costs and internal expenses to implement the new erps and expects to spend an additional million in fiscal to complete the implementation 
the company s system implementation plan currently anticipates conversion to the new erps by the willow grove and israeli equipment manufacturing facilities in the second quarter of fiscal in addition to the direct costs of implementing the erps the company expects to spend approximately million to train its employees in the use of the erps and upgrade other hardware and software systems to year compliant status 
in addition  the company has been in contact with its suppliers and other third parties to determine the extent to which they may be vulnerable to year issues 
as this assessment progresses  matters may come to the company s attention which could give rise to the need for remedial measures which have not yet been identified 
as a contingency  the company may replace the suppliers and third party vendors who can not demonstrate to the company that their products or services will be year compliant 
the company cannot currently predict the potential effect of third parties year issues on its business 
the company believes that its year compliance project will be completed in advance of the year date transition and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or overall trends in the results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or problems  including the failure to ensure year compliance by systems or products supplied to the company by a third party  will not have an adverse effect on the company  its financial performance  or the competitiveness or customer acceptance of its products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   the company had a non trading investment portfolio of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of million see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of september   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately
