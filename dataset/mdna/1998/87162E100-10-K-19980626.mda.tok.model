item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategy synthetech s strategy is to emphasize a commitment to its customers from the early phases of discovery through clinical development in order to develop more stable  longer term  large scale orders as the drugs receive regulatory approval 
the receipt of two large scale orders for marketed drugs in fiscal exemplified this strategy 
the company had supplied pbbs for both of these drugs since their early clinical development stages 
product overview peptide building blocks 
peptides are short chains of generally less than amino acids and are used primarily in pharmaceuticals 
the production of peptides requires amino acids which have been chemically modified to enable them to more easily link with other amino acids in a particular sequence to form the desired peptide 
the company refers to these chemically modified amino acids as peptide building blocks or pbbs 
the amino acids which are transformed into pbbs may be either natural amino acids that is  amino acids which occur in nature or synthetic amino acids that is  amino acids which have a side chain that does not occur in nature  which the company refers to as specialty amino acids 
synthetech chemically modifies natural amino acids to produce pbbs 
the company also manufactures synthetic amino acids  and chemically modifies these synthetic amino acids to produce pbbs 
the company uses a wide array of raw materials to produce pbbs 
these materials generally are in adequate supply from multiple suppliers 
the company has developed and scaled up process technology to produce a wide range of pbb products at the multi kilogram to multi ton scale 
since  the company has produced over different pbb products 
other fine chemicals 
the company is capable of producing other fine chemical compounds 
these compounds have included grignard reagents and other fine chemicals conforming to the customer s confidential specifications 
as the company s core business in pbbs expanded over the past three years  the company stopped actively marketing these products 
the company has not produced nor received any revenue from these products since fiscal  when it sold  of grignard reagents and other fine chemicals 
while the company is establishing the additional processing facility to augment its pbb processing capabilities  the company might seek other fine chemical compounds and custom manufacturing opportunities as appropriate 
the company continues to produce most bulk orders on an as ordered basis  although it does carry an inventory of over pbb products 
at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders which the company believed to be firm was approximately million  all of which the company expects to ship during fiscal this backlog included million attributable to additional production in connection with two large scale orders that the company received in fiscal the backlog at march  was million 
the variation in backlog between march and march underscores the continued variability in the demand for the company s pbbs at any given time see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in january  the company entered into supply and technology agreements with biomeasure incorporated  a boston area biotechnology company and a subsidiary of groupe pharmaceutique beaufour ipsen of france with several synthetic peptide products under development 
under the supply agreement  the company has agreed to supply all of biomeasure s requirements for a particular synthetic pbb 
this agreement continues from year to year unless terminated in writing by one of the parties 
the company and biomeasure are also parties to a license agreement giving biomeasure the option to receive a license to produce for its own use the pbb which is the subject of the supply agreement between the parties 
under this license agreement  biomeasure must pay certain royalty amounts based on the amount produced 
marketing the company markets its products through attendance at trade shows  listings in biotechnology and chemical industry directories and advertisements in chemical trade periodicals 
in addition  the company maintains ongoing relationships with major pharmaceutical and other companies which it believes might have a need for its products 
customers although the company has over customers  the company expects that a few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues each year 
during fiscal  the company had five customers which accounted for of the company s revenues 
the company had two customers which individually accounted for over of the company s revenues 
these two multinational pharmaceutical companies accounted for and  respectively  of the synthetech s revenues for fiscal for the fiscal years ended march    and  sales to overseas customers were million  million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
these sales were principally to europe for fiscal  and to europe and japan for fiscal and competition because peptide based pharmaceuticals are relatively new  the market in the past for pbbs has been quite small with most sales in the hundreds of kilos or smaller size 
as a result  the pbb market has not attracted a significant amount of direct competition 
as the market continues to grow with multi ton order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in multi kilo or smaller quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of synthetic amino acid based pbbs  the company has competition on a selective product basis from fine chemical producers in europe and japan 
competition also increases for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into approved status as a result of the increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
many of the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them which are significantly greater than those available to the company 
the principal methods of competition in the market for pbbs and other fine chemicals are quality  customer service and price 
the company believes that it competes effectively in each of these areas 
the company also believes that its production of a wide range of products and quantities gives it a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
in addition  the company believes that pharmaceutical companies generally view internal production of pbbs as a misallocation of resources and  given a reliable source of a quality product  would rather obtain them from an outside supplier 
research and development the company s research and development efforts have focused principally on process development 
during the fiscal years ended march    and  the company s research and development expenses were   and  respectively 
these figures  however  do not completely reflect the company s research and development activity since substantial process development efforts have been associated with initial orders for new products and  accordingly  have been expensed as cost of sales associated with the product revenue rather than as a research and development expense 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
employees as of may   the company employed individuals  two of whom were part time 
regulatory matters as the company s products are intermediates sold to pharmaceutical producers  the company has been generally unaffected by fda regulation which is directed at final products sold to the public 
the company s customers do  however  typically impose inspection and quality assurance programs on the company 
these programs involve materials handling  recordkeeping and other requirements 
as some customers have begun to request the company to provide additional processing steps  these programs often include more extensive requirements 
the company anticipates that the expenses of complying with such programs will increase in the future 
the company s business is also subject to substantial regulation in the areas of safety  environmental release and hazardous waste disposal 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
as additional and more extensive regulations are being added in these areas at the federal  state and local levels  the compliance costs will inevitably continue to increase 
the operation of chemical manufacturing plants entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or an unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
also  the company generates hazardous and other wastes which are disposed of at various off site facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities due to releases of such substances into the environment 
the company maintains property damage insurance  liability insurance  environmental risk insurance  and product liability insurance 
product liability use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk of product liability 
there can be no assurance that claims for product liability will not be asserted against the company or that the company would be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company maintains product liability insurance with a million limit 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage 
company background the company was formed in to develop novel chemical process technology by combining classical organic chemistry with enzyme based biocatalysis 
for the first several years  it operated mainly as a research and development group focused on process development of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals 
after its initial public offering in  the company s research efforts were concentrated on the development of a proprietary process for aspartame and l phenylalanine 
although the company had entered into one license for this technology  the company does not expect additional licensing revenue 
throughout its development during the s  the company also offered contract research services 
these research services were typically provided to pharmaceutical clients and generally involved the development of biocatalytic processes that is  chemical processes which are affected by the use of enzymes or micro organisms 
since the end of fiscal  the company has phased out contract research services and does not anticipate receiving any significant revenue from research services in the future 
by the end of the s  the company  building on it prior experience  began to focus on the production of pbbs and other fine chemicals for customers 
during the s  the company has emerged as a leading producer of pbbs in gram  multi kilo and ton quantities 
factors affecting future results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements  and may contain the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  will be  will continue  will likely result or words or phrases of similar meanings 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following uncertain market for products  customer concentration  and potential quarterly revenue fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced from time to time substantial period to period revenue fluctuations reflecting the industry environment in which the company has operated 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the synthetically manufactured peptide based drugs into which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of peptide based drug development  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the food and drug administration fda  and  even if approved  the ultimate potential of such drugs 
recurring sales of pbbs for discovery or clinical trial stage development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from year to year and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales and the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including  without limitation  the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
since the company s revenues are composed of pbb sales in all three drug development stages  and since even sales of pbbs for marketed drugs are subject to cancellation or reduction  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
industry cost factors 
the market for pbbs is dependent on the market for pharmaceuticals products 
the levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
in addition  in both the united states and elsewhere  sales of prescription pharmaceuticals are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payors such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
peptide based drugs may not be considered cost effective  and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow peptide based drugs to be sold on a profitable basis 
in addition  as cost pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have tightened  the cancellation rate for drug development programs has increased 
industry cost pressures can also cause pharmaceutical companies to investigate alternative drug manufacturing processes which may not include pbbs 
competition 
in the past  the company has not had a significant amount of direct competition for discovery and clinical trial stage drug development projects 
the company believes that this resulted from peptide based pharmaceuticals  particularly those which utilize synthetic amino acids  being relatively new and the market for pbbs relatively small 
as the market has continued to grow with multi ton order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in the multi kilo or smaller quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of synthetic amino acid based pbbs  the company has competition on a selective product basis from fine chemical producers in europe and japan 
competition has also increased for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into an approved status as a result of increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
regulatory matters 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require the company to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a chemical manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  the company generates hazardous materials and other wastes which are disposed at various offsite facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
the company has obtained environmental risk insurance 
potential regulation 
the pbbs produced by the company are intermediate ingredients which are then processed by the companies to which they are sold  and are therefore currently not subject to the requirements of the fda 
the company s customers do  however  typically impose inspection and quality assurance programs on the company 
these programs involve materials handling  record keeping and other requirements 
as many of the company s customers are requiring increased processing by the company of its products  the company expects these compliance programs to become more extensive 
the company may not be able to comply with the applicable requirements or such requirements may require the expenditure of significant capital 
product liability 
use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk of product liability 
claims for product liability could be asserted against the company and the company may not be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company has purchased product liability insurance with a limit of million 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage 
risks of technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies 
the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  and technological developments could cause the company s products and technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
manufacturing capacity 
as a manufacturer of pbbs  the company will continually face risks regarding the availability and costs of raw materials and labor  the potential need for additional capital equipment  increased maintenance costs  plant and equipment obsolescence and quality control 
the company has recently completed an additional manufacturing facility on its site in albany  oregon to increase production capacity 
initially  processing equipment was installed in two of the six bays 
recently the company announced its decision to install processing equipment in two additional bays 
the company expects that this additional phase will be completed in calendar completion of the second phase at the new facility could be delayed and the existing facilities may not have sufficient capacity to meet the demand for the company s products  particularly in the event that several of the peptide based drugs for which the company supplies pbbs simultaneously become commercially successful 
a disruption in the company s production or distribution could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
in addition  the company may not have sufficient demand to utilize the additional capacity 
risks of international business 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended march  the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales 
the company s business is and will be subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign governmental regulation and changes in economic conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell its products in international markets 
in addition  the company s business is subject to the risks associated with legislation and regulation relating to imports  including quotas  duties or taxes and other charges  restrictions and retaliatory actions on imports to other countries in which the company s products may be sold or manufactured 
year compliance 
the company relies on computer systems and software to operate its business 
after review  the company believes that its software applications will be able to appropriately interpret the calendar year and subsequent years after certain upgrades are completed during fiscal the company does not expect that the cost of these upgrades will be material 
while the company does not believe it to be the case  there is a risk that the company s software applications will be unable to appropriately interpret such years despite the installation of these upgrades 
significant compliance costs or the failure by the company to achieve full year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and or financial condition 
in addition  the company could be adversely affected by the failure of others  including without limitation  vendors  customers  transportation companies and utility companies  to become fully year compliant 
item properties synthetech s headquarters and production facilities are located in albany  oregon 
in  the company purchased the albany  oregon property which included a  square foot facility 
this original facility houses production  pilot plant  laboratory  warehouse and office space 
in november  the company completed the construction of an additional  square foot production facility on the albany  oregon property 
the completion of this additional two story production facility substantially increases the company s capacity to produce pbbs and other fine chemicals 
this facility has six production bays 
two of the bays are outfitted with manufacturing equipment and in production 
on may   the company announced its decision to outfit two more bays 
the final two bays remain vacant and available for future expansion 
in the initial construction of the building and the build out of the first two bays  synthetech contracted with various third party providers 
the company issued purchase orders to such providers with detailed specifications  services to be provided and the prices to be paid 
the company received either limited or no written warranties by such third party providers and  therefore  may be limited in its ability to pursue remedies in the event that the new building has problems or other defects in the future 
however  the building has been inspected by the city of albany to verify that  as constructed  it meets all applicable building codes  including ada  electrical  seismic  fire and hazardous occupancy 
all specifications were reviewed by an independent third party engineering firm selected by the city of albany prior to approval of various construction permits

see industry factors below 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflected the absence or presence of large scale orders 
revenues from large scale orders were million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects that fiscal revenues will be substantially larger than fiscal at march   the company had a backlog of pbb orders for delivery in fiscal of approximately million 
of this amount  million was attributable to the unfilled balance of the two large scale orders that it received in fiscal while the company produces pbbs for a number of approved drugs  the two large scale orders received in fiscal were the first large scale pbb orders in the company s history to be received for use in marketed or approved drugs 
the revenue received from large scale orders in fiscal and fiscal were associated with pbbs sold for use in clinical trials 
pbb sales associated with marketed drugs are much more likely to provide a longer term  ongoing revenue stream 
the risk that drug production is cancelled is substantially lower after it is being actively marketed 
of course  continuation of customer demand for these pbbs remains subject to various market conditions  including continued market demand for the drug  competition from other suppliers of pbbs and potential use of alternative drug manufacturing routes not involving pbbs 
see industry factors below 
the two large scale orders received in fiscal exemplify synthetech s long term growth strategy of emphasizing a commitment to its customers from the early phases of discovery through clinical development in order to develop more stable  longer term large scale orders as the drugs receive regulatory approval 
the company had supplied pbbs for both of these drugs since their early clinical development stages 
with the addition of sales from the two large scale orders  the company estimates that in fiscal approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately went into drugs in clinical or late pre clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
with the unfilled balance of the two large scale orders aggregating million at the beginning of fiscal  the company expects the percentage of fiscal sales of pbbs to be used in the marketed drug sector to be equal to or higher than the fiscal percentage 
in fiscal  the company estimates that approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately went into drugs in clinical or late pre clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal  the company estimates that approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately went into drugs in clinical or late pre clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
these estimates are based on an analysis of the company s sales and information to the extent available from customers 
the revenues during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal represented sales of pbbs  the company s primary product line  except for  of sales in fiscal associated with the sale of grignard reagents and other fine chemicals 
gross profit gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this reflects a decrease in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal  and a increase in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of revenues  gross profits were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
decreased revenues negatively affect gross profit margins 
product mix ie  type and volume of product sold as individual orders can also significantly affect gross profit margins either positively or negatively 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal from fiscal reflected a combination of factors the decline in revenues resulting from the absence of large scale projects until the end of the third quarter of fiscal  the increased manufacturing overhead costs as the new plant facility came online in fiscal  costs associated with the start up and early process development at the new plant facility  and the product mix in fiscal the company anticipates that the gross profit margin will improve in fiscal with the anticipated increase in revenues  although the company expects to see some reduction in this margin from fiscal and fiscal levels reflecting a higher mix of larger scale orders 
the increase in the gross profit margin in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from the increased level of revenues and product mix 
the company expects revenues and product mix to continue to fluctuate from period to period and cause variation in gross profit margins 
operating expenses research and development r d expense increased to  or of sales  in fiscal  from  or of sales  in fiscal r d expense was  or  in fiscal these figures  however  do not completely reflect the company s research and development activity since substantial process development efforts have been associated with initial orders for new products and  accordingly  have been expensed as cost of sales associated with the product revenue rather than as a research and development expense 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a in fiscal from fiscal primarily reflected the employee bonus reduction in fiscal as the staffing level in this area remained relatively constant 
the increase in sg a in fiscal from fiscal principally reflected the addition of one staff employee  base salary and bonus increases  and increases in marketing  director and officer insurance and expenses related to the company s move to the nasdaq national market 
sg a as a percentage of sales was   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
operating income operating income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  company wide labor costs including bonus hereinafter labor costs decreased to million from million in fiscal while the company hired additional employees during fiscal in connection with its plant expansion  the reduction in the level of bonuses paid during fiscal as compared to fiscal more than offset the hiring increase  causing the net reduction in labor costs 
in fiscal  labor costs increased nearly reflecting compensation increases and employee additions during the fiscal year 
in fiscal  labor costs increased 
over half of this increase was attributable to compensation increases and the remainder resulted from an increase in employee hiring beginning in the second half of fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating income decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and to in fiscal with the operating expense level in fiscal and fiscal being relatively comparable  the decrease in operating margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally reflected the decrease in the gross profit margin discussed above 
other income the  net other income in fiscal primarily resulted from  of interest earnings and a  recognized gain from the sale of securities available for sale

industry factors the market for pbbs is driven by the market for synthetically manufactured peptide based drugs in which they are incorporated 
the drug development process for these peptide based drugs is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of peptide based drug development  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda and  even if approved  the ultimate market potential of such drugs 
the three stages of the drug development process include r d or discovery stage  clinical trial stage and marketed drug stage 
synthetech s customers can spend years researching and developing new drugs  taking only a small percentage to clinical trials and fewer yet to commercial market 
a substantial amount of the activity continues to occur at the earlier stages of research and development and clinical trials 
in spite of the two large scale orders received by the company in fiscal  the market for peptide based drugs is still very early in development 
while the company has recorded substantial annual sales of pbbs for discovery and clinical trial stage development  recurring sales of pbbs for development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from quarter to quarter and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
while the company has been selling pbbs for marketed drugs for several years  these sales represented a relatively small portion of total revenue 
with the two large scale orders received in fiscal for pbbs to be used in marketed drugs  revenues of pbbs for marketed drugs represent a significant portion of total revenue for the first time in the company s history 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales 
moreover  the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including  without limitation  the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
also  with the longer term  larger scale orders  the company expects increased competition to supply these pbbs  and industry cost pressures can also cause pharmaceutical companies to investigate alternative drug manufacturing processes which may not include pbbs as an intermediate 
in the past  the company has felt that it had neither a stable baseload of demand nor an ability to predict future demand beyond its current order base 
with the advent of the two large scale pbb orders for use in marketed drugs  the company has significantly increased the size and the term of its current order base 
also  the likelihood of recurring revenue from reorders is significantly higher for these two pbbs since they are used in marketed drugs 
nevertheless  since the company s revenues are composed of pbb sales in all three drug development stages  and since even sales of pbbs for marketed drugs are subject to cancellation or reduction  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of million compared to million at march   and million at march  the company s cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled million 
the company no longer holds securities available for sale after selling its last holding in fiscal in addition  the company has a  unsecured bank line of credit 
as of march  there was no amount outstanding under the bank line 
the increase in accounts receivable to million at march   from  at march   reflected the higher level of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year 
the increase of inventory to million at march   from million at march   primarily resulted from replenishing lower levels of raw material and finished product inventory items and the build up of raw materials and work in process related to the two large scale orders received in fiscal inventory was million at march  the decrease in accrued compensation to  at march   from  at march   primarily reflected the payment in the first quarter of fiscal of bonuses accrued for fiscal in november  the company completed the  square foot  two story new building plant expansion project 
in this initial phase  the company completed the building structure and built out two of the six production bays 
the overall engineering  construction and equipment costs for this project spanning years were approximately million 
on may   the company announced that its board of directors had approved a million second phase expansion to outfit two more bays of the new plant with four additional multipurpose reactor systems 
the company is currently operating three production shifts  five days a week
