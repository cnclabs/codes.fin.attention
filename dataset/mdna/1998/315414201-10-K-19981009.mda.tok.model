item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information to assist in the understanding of the company s results from continuing operations  unless otherwise noted  and financial condition 
as described in item  on september   certain of the assets of the company s systems division were sold to general signal for  in cash 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the sale 
this discussion reflects the fact that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company is reporting the results of operations from the systems division as discontinued operations and that the company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal and prior periods  as well as all related footnotes  have been revised to reflect this accounting treatment of the systems division in those periods 
it should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in the preceding section and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere herein 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal in fiscal  the company s consolidated net revenues increased to  from the  reported in fiscal the changes in revenues by segment are shown in the following table components   distributed products   total revenues   sales in the components product lines increased due primarily to the upturn in semiconductor equipment manufacturing that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and from a significant increase in sales of rotary feedthrough seals in europe primarily in non semiconductor markets 
in addition  the recently introduced line of industrial gas tight seals also contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal in the distributed products business segment  sales of components and power supplies for the thin film deposition industry contributed significantly to the increase 
sales of magnetic fluids remained relatively flat for the year as compared to the prior year  as heavy competition in the audio fluid business  particularly in asia  prevented a significant sales increase 
total sales of the company s european subsidiary  ap t  which includes the sale of the company s components and fluid products in europe  as well as comprising the distributed products segment  increased by to  as compared to  in fiscal the increases were in both the ferrofluidic r product lines and in the distributed products 
sales from the company s japanese subsidiary were lower than in the previous fiscal year  which was due to the competitive price pressures brought on by the decline of the yen in relation to the dollar  putting products manufactured in the us at a significant cost disadvantage 
bookings increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was both in distributed products and in rotary feedthrough seals 
bookings for magnetic fluid sales for were  which is slightly higher than the  for order backlog at the end of fiscal was  as compared to the backlog in the prior year of  the majority of the order backlog at the end of fiscal is expected to ship in fiscal consolidated gross margin for fiscal was  a decrease from the in fiscal the decrease in margin was due to decreases in margin in the magnetic fluids product line and in the company s european operations 
engineering and product development expenses in fiscal were  which is comparable to the  spent in fiscal engineering and product development expenses have been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on the basis of the amounts actually spent by each division 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were  which is  or less than the  incurred in and  as a percent of revenues  decreased from in to in selling and marketing costs decreased by  due primarily to a  decrease in selling expenses at ap t which was the result of restructuring efforts undertaken in late fiscal and a  decrease in selling expenses in japan 
administrative expenses accounted for the remainder of the decrease  which was due in part to decreases in legal costs  and insurance 
general corporate expenses have been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on the basis of the actual amounts incurred on behalf of the respective divisions 
in addition  certain expenses for corporate officers salaries  travel  etc 
and accounting department personnel primarily salaries were also allocated on the basis of the estimated time and expenses incurred on behalf of each respective division 
net interest expense in fiscal was  an increase of  from net interest expense incurred in fiscal the increase is due to higher average borrowings under the company s line of credit agreement 
net interest expense and other bank charges and fees have been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on the basis of the net identifiable assets used in those operations 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the company s debt obligations 
the company records transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currency as other income or expense 
during fiscal   of net foreign currency transaction losses were recorded as compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the losses in and  primarily incurred by the company s japanese subsidiary whose functional currency is the us dollar for accounting purposes  arose as a result of the weakening of the japanese yen against the dollar during much of and gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar are recorded directly to equity 
the balance of other income expense in was principally other financing costs  which did not change materially from the previous fiscal year 
the income tax expense in of  is comprised of a provision for foreign income taxes on the company s earnings 
the income tax benefit of  in consisted principally of a tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of which represents a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of income taxes 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was approximately  for as compared to  for fiscal versus fiscal in fiscal  the company incurred a loss of  or 
per share  compared to income of  or 
per share  recorded in fiscal the decline was the result of lower sales volumes and increased expenses  particularly in the areas of marketing and product development 
in fiscal  product revenues decreased to  from  in fiscal this decrease in the company s level of business can be directly attributed to a significant decline in the semiconductor industry in general  which accounts for a substantial portion of the components segment revenues 
the changes in revenues by segment are summarized as follows components   distributed products   total revenues   the decrease in components revenues in was due to a slowdown in the production of capital equipment for the semiconductor industry during the first three quarters of which caused the demand for the company s rotary feedthrough seals to decline sharply  resulting in an decrease in revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  the order rate for seals began to improve as the outlook for the industry improved 
revenues in the distributed products segment  which principally serves the thin film deposition industry  remained relatively level with those of total sales from the company s european subsidiary  ap t  which includes the sale of the company s components and fluid products in europe  as well as comprising the distributed products segment  decreased to  in  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was entirely within the ferrofluidic r product lines  as the distributed products revenues remained level with the prior year 
sales of seals and fluids by the company s japanese subsidiary  fjc  increased to  over the  of revenues in  evidencing the company s penetration into that market 
despite the increase in business with japan  total foreign sales declined to  from  in bookings in decreased to  from  in  which was due primarily to the slow down in the semiconductor industry in order bookings in the company s components division  which includes the sale of seals and fluids  totaled  which includes bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal of  a record for the segment 
the resulting order backlog for that segment at the end of the fiscal year was  an increase of over the components division backlog at june  consolidated order backlog at june  totaled  as compared to  at june  the consolidated gross margin for the year ended june  was  an increase of over from the gross margin of in the previous year 
although revenues declined  the overall product mix was essentially unchanged 
the improvement in margin was due to primarily to an increase in margin in the magnetic fluids segment 
consolidated operating income before general corporate and non operating expenses increased in to of product revenues as compared to in this was the result of better margins from the components segment as well as lower sustaining engineering and product development costs 
the company spent  during fiscal on engineering and product development  an amount equal to of product revenues compared to  or of product revenues in the preceding year 
engineering costs as a percent of revenues decreased in principally due to the reallocating of engineers to the former systems division 
engineering and product development expenses have been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on the basis of the amounts actually spent by each division 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in increased  or over such expenses in  and increased as a percent of revenues from in to in selling and marketing costs increased by  due in part to a  increase in selling expenses in japan and a  increase in selling expenses in europe 
administrative expenses accounted for the rest of the increase  which was due in part to increases in legal costs  personnel costs  and severance 
general corporate expenses have been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on the basis of the actual amounts incurred on behalf of the respective divisions 
in addition  certain expenses for corporate officers salaries  travel  etc 
and accounting department personnel primarily salaries were also allocated on the basis of the estimated time and expenses incurred on behalf of each division 
interest income in was down from that in  due principally to lower levels of invested cash 
interest expense of  was up over the  in the prior year as a result of higher borrowings against the company s revolving line of credit 
net interest expense and other bank charges and fees have been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on the basis of the net identifiable assets used in those operations 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the company s debt obligations 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a  tax benefit 
the benefit resulted from a reduction of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that is required to be recorded when the company s management is of the opinion that the tax benefit is more likely than not to be realized 
the recording of this benefit may affect the company s effective corporate tax rate in future periods 
income tax expense of  in consisted of a provision for foreign income taxes on the company s foreign earnings 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of income taxes 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was approximately  for as compared to  for liquidity and capital resources the discussion in this section reflects both continuing and discontinued operations 
in  the operations of the business used  of cash  as compared to  in for fiscal  the net loss of  was offset by decreases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaids and other current assets and an increase in customer deposits which amounted to    and  respectively 
the cash requirements for and were financed from borrowings under the company s expanded revolving line of credit as discussed below 
the company typically received advance payments from the sale of crystal growing systems under large multi unit contracts as certain milestones were met  including receipt of the order  submission of accepted engineering drawings  shipment and final acceptance of the units 
in and  the company received advance payments of  and  respectively  in connection with orders for crystal growing systems 
in order to secure its sources of supply for critical long lead time inventory items  the company has also had to make advance payments to its vendors 
the balance remaining on deposit with vendors was  at june  the company has purchase contracts for inventory with various suppliers which  in some cases  extend beyond two years 
at june   outstanding purchase commitments pursuant to these contracts totaled approximately  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of which is down from at the end of working capital at june  decreased to  from  at june  current assets decreased  principally due to lower accounts receivable  inventories and advances to suppliers 
however  the decrease in receivables did not result in an improvement in receivable turnover in as the softening in the semiconductor industry caused customers to delay their payments 
due to the large decrease in inventories from  inventory turnover increased from times annual consumption in to times in in december  the company entered into a new credit agreement with its bank which resulted in the expansion of its revolving line of credit from  to  in october   the company began to construct a second mm machine with the intent to install it in a mm crystal growing demonstration center at its nashua facilities see further discussion in next paragraph 
in connection with this project  the company s bank agreed to lend the company an additional  on a day promissory note to assist in the financing of the construction of this machine 
these changes are discussed in more detail in note d to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures on a consolidated basis totaled  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the spending in both years consisted primarily of improvements to the company s nashua facility  and in included the construction of a mm machine and the replacement of two old and outdated lathes in the company s in house machine shop 
other spending included modifications to the manufacturing facility and upgrades to computer equipment and software  primarily for engineering purposes 
also  during  the company spent approximately  not including engineering costs which have been expensed  on the construction of a mm machine for demonstration purposes 
on september   the company sold this mm machine and certain optional equipment for approximately book value 
upon signing of the sales agreement for this machine  the company received  in cash with the balance due upon shipment of the machine  which is expected to occur within six months 
the company has long term financing in the form of a  variable rate industrial revenue bond vrirb 
the vrirb is subject to a variable rate of interest keyed to short term nontaxable rates at june    the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund the construction of the company s nashua  nh headquarters 
the company also has a credit facility with its bank which provided the company with total credit of approximately   of which is in the form of a stand by letter of credit for the company s vrirb   of which was a revolving line of credit for working capital purposes and  of which was in the form of a day promissory note 
the stand by letter of credit expired in august  and has been renewed for one year 
the letter of credit carries a fee of per year and the revolving credit facility bears interest at prime rate plus at june  with a fee of on the unused portion 
at june    was outstanding against the revolving line of credit 
the promissory note  which was renewed on june   bears interest at the same rate as the revolving credit line 
the company used a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale to pay off the entire  balance of the line of credit and the entire  balance of the promissory note outstanding as of september  see discussion below regarding the reduction of the maximum available borrowings under the line of credit agreement 
see also note k to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the sale 
during  the company borrowed  in the form of an installment demand note with its bank  to finance the capital expansion of its in house machine shop 
the note bears interest at and expires in january at june   the balance on this note was  in addition  the company  through its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  has various short term financing arrangements with local banks totaling approximately  at june  during  the maximum outstanding borrowing on these foreign credit lines was  the weighted average interest rates during the year on these facilities ranged from to and the interest rates at june  ranged from to 
as described in item  certain of the assets of the company s systems division were sold on september  to general signal for  in cash 
a portion of the cash proceeds from this sale has been used to pay off certain outstanding debt as of the closing of the sale 
the sale  as structured  did not include any of the systems division accounts receivable or liabilities  which remain with the company 
the sale also did not include the obligation to complete approximately  in backlog for crystal growing systems  which obligation remains with the company  or approximately  in inventory on hand  all of which is needed to fulfill such backlog 
the terms of the sale provide that  generally  any unfulfilled backlog existing as of december   will be transferred to general signal 
the backlog includes a purchase order from one customer for nine machines  representing approximately  the company believes that the customer is seeking to modify the terms of the order  including its potential cancellation 
however  the company believes that the purchase order remains legally valid  and that under its terms  the customer is obligated to pay the company the costs incurred up to cancellation of the order 
in connection with these machines  the company has inventory of approximately  on hand and approximately  in parts on order at vendors 
if the company is unable to recover these cancellation charges from the customer  the company may be required to take a material write down of the inventory relating to the purchase order 
the sale did not include approximately  in accounts receivable which were outstanding as of the closing of the sale 
while the company believes that it will be able to collect these receivables within established reserves but there can be no assurance that the sale will not adversely affect their collectibility 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of discontinued operations 
the present line of credit from the company s bank expires in november in connection with the sale  on september   the company and its bank agreed to reduce the maximum borrowings under the line of credit agreement from  to  in the fall of  management expects to begin discussions with the bank to renew the line of credit at a level which management believes will be in line with the working capital needs in the continuing operations 
it is expected that the proceeds received from the sale and other cash flow will significantly reduce the company s need for short term borrowing arrangements to finance working capital needs in the near future 
management therefore believes that anticipated funds from operations and the borrowing arrangements that are expected to be put into place will be adequate to meet cash requirements for the year ahead 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income and statement no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
both statements must be adopted by the company in fiscal year statement no 
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a complete set of financial statements 
statement no 
changes the way segment information is reported and establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop  which must be adopted by the company in fiscal year  requires capitalization of certain costs to develop or obtain internal use software 
the company believes that the adoption of these standards is not likely to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
effects of inflation inflation rates over the past three years have remained relatively low and  as a result  have not had a material impact on the financial results of the company 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s products in the components business are mechanical devices or fluids and do not contain any electronic components 
the company s products in its distributed products business include an electron beam gun for use in vacuum deposition processes which is electronically controlled  but includes no date sensitive devices 
consequentially  the company has no need to make any changes to its products in anticipation of the year prior to the sale  the company s systems division sold products that were controlled by computerized hardware and software  but the processes involved were inherently not date sensitive 
the software involved was purchased off the shelf  and was not customized by the company 
all recent products delivered to customers with company supplied control systems have been year compliant  but some older systems contain older versions of the software and  as a result  may not be year compliant 
since these products are not in warranty  and since the company has not warranted their year compliance  the company believes that it has no further obligations with respect to these products 
all products delivered with company supplied control systems out of backlog prior to december   in accordance with the terms of the sale  will be year compliant 
the company has sent requests to all of its principal providers of services and component parts to advise the company of their progress in making their internal systems year compliant 
the company believes it has a sufficient base of critical component suppliers so that if any supplier is unable to deliver parts due to year problems  alternate sources will be available and that any supply interruption will not be material to its operations 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company would be able to obtain all of its supply requirements from such alternate sources on terms comparable with that of its current suppliers 
the company has identified one critical service supplier its bank  the failure of whose systems for an extended period for any reason  including year problems  could cause financially material adverse consequences to the company 
the bank has provided assurance in writing to the company that its systems will be year compliant 
with respect to its internal systems  the company has undertaken an assessment of its vulnerability to the year issue 
the company does not rely on electronic interaction with customers or vendors  and has in recent years relied almost entirely on purchased off the shelf software packages for both business and engineering purposes 
these packages have not been materially customized by the company for its purposes 
these software packages run on a personal computer based local area network which was installed by the company in  and which has been upgraded as needed since then 
the assessment was based upon formal and informal communications with the software vendors  literature supplied with the software  literature received in connection with maintenance contracts  and test evaluations of the software 
systems critical to the business which have been identified as vulnerable to the year problem either have been  or are being  replaced with new purchased software or corrected by upgrades available from vendors 
outside companies such as vendors  major customers  service suppliers  communications providers and banks are being asked to verify their year readiness and the company is testing interaction with such systems where appropriate 
the assessment thus far has been accomplished  and is expected to be completed  utilizing the company s existing resources  and is not expected to have an adverse material effect on the company s financial results 
it is the company s belief that the results of the assessment to date indicate that all of the company s major business systems software is year compliant  or will be year compliant by the end of calendar year  and that the year issue is not likely to have a material impact on the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurances that the systems or software of third parties on which the company relies will be timely converted and the company may be adversely affected by the failure of such a third party to become year compliant 
the company has not yet developed a plan to deal with this contingency but expects to have such a plan in place by the end of fiscal euro currency the company derived approximately of its revenue from continuing operations in fiscal from its operations in germany and england 
historically  transactions in europe have been denominated in a variety of currencies 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union are scheduled to adopt the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the local currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries until january  during this transition period  goods and services may be paid for using either the euro or the participating country s local currency 
thereafter  the local currencies will be canceled and the euro currency will be used for all transactions between the eleven participating members of the european union 
the euro conversion raises strategic as well as operational issues 
the conversion is expected to result in a number of changes  including the stimulation of cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
the company is evaluating the implications of the euro conversion and is uncertain as to the potential impact on its operations 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of there are certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made above 
these include  but are not limited to  changes in revenues in the company s components  fluids and thin film deposition businesses  expected working capital needs of the continuing operations  a material change in the market conditions within the semiconductor industry and  changes in management s assessments regarding the company s obligations under outstanding purchase orders  ability to fulfill existing sales order backlog  the recoverability of inventory and the ability to collect accounts receivable relating to the discontinued systems division  the resolution of a dispute with a customer over the validity of a purchase order relating to the discontinued systems division and failure of the company s systems or software  or the systems or software of a third party on which the company relies to be year compliant
