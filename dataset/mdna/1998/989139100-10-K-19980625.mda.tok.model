item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions of canadian dollars  except per share amounts mitel s revenue reached a record high in fiscal due to strong performances in each of the core businesses and recent acquisitions 
total revenue grew by to in fiscal from in fiscal by business group  semiconductor revenue grew by and business communications systems revenue was up from the previous year 
the semiconductor growth rate was mainly attributable to increased shipments of integrated and hybrid circuits and to the consolidation of plessey which was acquired on february  the bcs revenue growth was driven by higher sales volumes of pbx systems  telephone sets and new convergent systems and by increased service revenue 
the company reported record net income of  or per share  for the year ended march   an improvement of  or per share  over fiscal fiscal net income was  or per share  after deducting a fourth quarter restructuring and other charge of  or per share 
primary drivers behind the improvement were the higher sales volumes and lower expenses as a percentage of sales resulting from actions taken to focus operations and improve the sales channels 
net income also benefitted from an accrual for investment tax credits itcs amounting to  or per share  which relate to itcs expected to be realized in the foreseeable future 
there was no such corresponding item or amount in fiscal fiscal earnings per share were reduced by per share  after interest and tax  due to the consolidation of plessey which was acquired mid way through the fourth quarter 
net income for the three fiscal years ended march   march  and march  as determined by us accounting principles is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions as well as two others shortly after its fiscal year end 
on february   the company acquired all of the capital stock of four affiliated entities  which together with their respective subsidiaries comprise plessey  from the general electric company plc for us in cash 
plessey is an international semiconductor company focused primarily on telecommunications and media applications 
management believes the combined semiconductor business will rank mitel among the major networking and telecommunications semiconductor companies in the world with a diverse product offering and advanced technology expertise along with the ability to produce bipolar  complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos and optoelectronic components 
the bcs portfolio was strengthened on august  with the acquisition of the assets and remote access technology business of gandalf for in cash 
gandalf s products facilitate  in a cost effective manner  high volume data and voice communications between the corporate office  local branches  teleworkers and agents in the field 
in addition  on may   the company acquired the customer premises equipment business unit of centigram for us in cash 
certain working capital assets related to that business were also purchased by mitel for us in cash 
the acquisition will complement mitel s bcs communications portfolio with voice messaging solutions to meet increasing customer demand for voicemail and unified messaging solutions 
on may   the company acquired the products  technology  research and development facilities and sales and marketing organization of glasgow based tsc for in cash 
the acquisition enhances mitel s product portfolio with isdn business products for the small to medium enterprise market 
tsc was formed in february  following a management buy out of the former philips business communications systems plant in scotland 
tsc was in receivership at the time of the acquisition

the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary information constitute an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis 
readers may wish to make reference to the glossary of terms contained in annex a of this annual report on form k to assist in their understanding of this discussion 
results of operations mitel s business is global and comprises the design  manufacture and sale of semiconductors  subsystems and systems to world markets in the communications industries 
these products and related services include integrated circuits for wired and wireless applications  applications specific integrated circuits  optoelectronic devices and custom silicon wafers  voice communications systems  networked voice and data systems  cti systems and applications  telephony enabled servers  public switching systems  and alternate network and remote access products 
the company sells its products through both direct and indirect channels of distribution 
factors affecting the choice of distribution  among others  include end customer type  the level of product complexity and integration requirements  the stage of product introduction  geographic presence  location of markets and volume levels 
revenue revenue during the last three fiscal years  based on the geographic location of mitel s customers  was distributed as follows fiscal year ended march united states europe other regions canada for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue by primarily as a result of changes in the uk pound sterling and uk dollar exchange rates 
fiscal revenue was favorably impacted by as a result of changes in the us dollar and us pound sterling exchange rates 
semiconductors semiconductors comprise integrated circuits for wired and wireless applications  asics  optoelectronic devices and custom silicon wafers 
as a percentage of total revenue  semiconductors accounted for  and  respectively  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended march semiconductor revenue semiconductor revenue in fiscal increased by from fiscal as a result of increased demand for the company s integrated circuits and thick film hybrid products  primarily in the us and asia pacific regions  and the effects of consolidating recently acquired plessey mid way through the fourth quarter 
excluding the plessey acquisition  the increase in mitel s semiconductor revenue reflected the world wide growth in the communications segment of the semiconductor industry and growth in the market for asics  particularly for medical applications 
technological advances and increasingly complex end user requirements affecting telecom and datacom networks have stimulated the demand for mitel s wired communication components and asics 
in recent years  the strong demand in global communications markets caused mitel s principal semiconductor operations to reach capacity 
the company took major steps in fiscal to expand its production capacity through both the acquisition of mitel semiconductor ab  formerly abb hafo ab  which has a semiconductor plant in jarfalla  sweden  and a major capital expansion program at its fabrication plant in bromont  quebec  canada 
both initiatives were necessary to meet the growing demand for mitel s integrated circuits 
the most significant part of the first phase of the bromont expansion program  which increased the volume capacity of the existing mm wafer production  was completed during the first quarter of fiscal the second part of the first phase  which introduced new micron technology  as well as the second phase  which increased the plant s production capacity by converting to mm wafer production  was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the acquisition of plessey also provides the company with significantly more manufacturing capacity 
management believes the plessey acquisition significantly enhances the company s operations  technologies and product portfolio 
in particular  plessey provides a strong customer base and expanded geographic presence  enhanced research and development capability  expanded manufacturing capabilities and a diverse and complementary product offering 
plessey brings to mitel a strong direct channel relationship with its customers 
technology expertise was obtained in radio frequency and high speed transmission for communications applications  mixed signal  high frequency and high speed transmission for communications and asics markets  and gate array and reduced instruction set computer processor technologies 
the manufacturing capability principally includes two semiconductor fabrication facilities  a leading edge mm bipolar facility in swindon  england and a high performance mm cmos facility in plymouth  england  which uses micron technology 
the product portfolio encompasses asic components  wireless applications and mass optical storage and networking fast ethernet products  complemented by systems level integration expertise for custom solutions 
at the time of the acquisition  the plessey group had annualized sales of approximately us and was incurring losses 
management expects that plessey will have a dilutive effect on the company s earnings in the first half of fiscal fiscal semiconductor revenue increased over fiscal by primarily as a result of the additional revenue from mitel semiconductor ab  which was acquired at the end of fiscal  and increased demand for integrated circuits  wafers and thick film hybrid products in all regions 
on october   the company sold its non strategic thermal print head operation to a german distributor for a nominal amount 
business communications systems business communications systems comprise pbx and peripheral products  open communications systems  applications  systems integration  the gx public switching system and alternate network and remote access products 
all of the company s service revenue relates to bcs  primarily pbx 
fiscal year ended march bcs revenue products service compared to fiscal  bcs product revenue in fiscal increased by  from to  due to higher sales volumes of sx and sx systems  including the associated pull through of system sets  incremental sales of remote access products  new convergence system sales of networked voice and data products and increased shipments of alternate network access products 
us indirect channel sales benefitted from a strong north american economy and the successful launch of the sx ml late in the fourth quarter of fiscal the sx ml voice system is aimed at the fast growing small business  under line  market in the united states and other countries 
the sx ml was made available to the company s us supply houses and dealers and selected canadian and caribbean telephone companies during the first quarter of fiscal us direct channel sales benefitted from strong growth in the installation of new systems as well as from upgrades in the existing customer base 
with respect to europe  sales increased in fiscal as a result of recently deregulated network access services in the uk  which created a strong demand by alternate carriers for mitel s alternate network access products 
european pbx sales also increased on system upgrades sold to the installed base 
bcs sales into the asia pacific region continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing effects of weakened economies and intense price competition in that region 
management believes this trend will continue for the foreseeable future without a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
in proportion to total revenue  bcs service revenue remained steady at approximately of total revenue 
service revenue grew mainly due to the managed service business in the uk  where telecom product related services are channeled through outsourcing companies 
the program was introduced in the second half of fiscal fiscal bcs revenue increased by to from fiscal s revenue of the revenue growth was due to increased demand for alternate network access products  improved sales of cti applications and higher sx sales through the us indirect channel 
european and us markets were characterized by intense pricing pressures resulting from competitive conditions  which constrained the rate of revenue growth 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue  total gross margin was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the product gross margin was in fiscal  equal to fiscal and one percentage point higher than in fiscal the product gross margin remained stable with the positive impact of higher sales volumes of bcs and semiconductor products offsetting lower average prices in certain bcs products 
the service gross margin improved to for the year ended march   an improvement of four and one percentage points over fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the service gross margin improvement was due to service call efficiencies and better technician utilization resulting from higher system sales in north america 
fiscal service gross margin included a benefit from the sale and transfer of certain uk maintenance contracts to bailey telecom limited 
operating expenses selling and administrative selling and administrative s a expenses in fiscal were  or of sales  compared with  or of sales  in fiscal in fiscal  s a expenses were  and also of sales 
s a expenses decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to strong revenue growth  spending restraints applied to marketing programs  higher efficiencies and focus in the sales channels and reduced corporate overhead costs 
the improvement was partially offset by the effects of consolidating recently acquired businesses 
the company acquired the business and assets of global village  an isdn solution provider based in the united kingdom  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the technology business of gandalf was acquired on august   and plessey was acquired on february  fiscal s a expenses increased over fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the results of operations of mitel semiconductor ab 
in addition  higher costs associated with new marketing initiatives and product launches and increased product support costs contributed to the increase over fiscal the marketing related costs included increased trade show activity  new corporate communications material  course development for dealers and end customers and an increase in personnel 
research and development research and development r d expenses amounted to  or of revenue  for fiscal this compares to and  or and of revenue  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts are exclusive of related r d amortization and net of canadian federal government r d incentives earned 
r d increased  in part  due to the inclusion of plessey s results of operations from february  where r d as a percentage of sales was higher than the company s average and to other increases in mitel semiconductor 
fiscal year ended march r d expense mitel s r d program consists of upgrade initiatives for existing products as well as research and development work in emerging technologies including  among others  the following cti  multimedia components and applications  networked voice and data  client server telecom  remote access  new isdn applications  and microelectronic components for real time applications in the communications  media and medical industries 
investment tax credits the company earns itcs in its canadian operations 
itcs are credits related to specific qualifying expenditures that are prescribed by canadian tax legislation 
in mitel s case  these itcs relate primarily to research and development expenses 
the itcs are recorded only when the enterprise has made the qualifying expenditures  provided there is reasonable assurance that the benefits will be realized 
when the itcs are not accrued in the year in which the qualifying expenditures are made because there is no reasonable assurance that the credits will be realized  such credits are accrued in a subsequent year when reasonable assurance of realization is first obtained 
the company separately recorded canadian itcs related to prior years r d amounting to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the itc accrual was comprised of two components in fiscal the first component amounted to which related to itcs that were realized for tax purposes in the same year 
the benefit of recording these itcs was mostly offset by a corresponding increase in tax expense to result in an insignificant impact to net earnings 
in the respective comparative periods of fiscal and fiscal  the total itcs recorded by the company related to this tax realization principle 
the second component of the fiscal accrual amounted to  or per share  and related to management s assessment that reasonable assurance exists for accruing the benefit of itcs expected to be realized for tax purposes in the foreseeable future 
the reasonable assurance is derived from management s assessment that there is sufficient evidence of profitability in the near future from operations in which these carryforwards arose 
restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced plans to restructure its bcs operations in light of the competitive conditions in the market place and the need to curtail certain non profitable activities 
a total charge of was recorded and included a write off of the company s investment in tianchi mitel telecommunications corporation  the company s joint venture in china 
the remaining was provided for severance costs related to bcs operations in north america and the united kingdom 
focus was also placed on streamlining the distribution channels and reducing corporate expenses 
the restructuring also resulted in the decision to curtail further development of the company s radicall product due to insufficient sales made to the regional bell operating companies and public network operators in the united states 
during the year ended march   restructuring charges amounting to were charged to the provision  actions and charges related to the remaining provision of will be substantially completed during fiscal amortization amortization increased in fiscal to from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase is due primarily to the semiconductor capacity expansion capital program in bromont  replacements and upgrades to the company s other manufacturing plants and the inclusion of plessey s results of operations from february  to march  the increase in fiscal over fiscal resulted from the bromont capital program and the inclusion of mitel semiconductor ab s results of operations 
investment and interest income investment and interest income was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease from the prior year was due to a gain realized in fiscal from the sale of a non strategic investment in esprit telecom jersey ltd 
esprit was sold for cash proceeds of  representing a total gain of  or after tax 
interest income was otherwise flat between fiscal and fiscal due to stable cash balances  but less than in fiscal due to lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest expense over prior years resulted from an increase in the company s capital leases and from interest on the term loan indebtedness incurred by the company on february  in connection with the plessey acquisition 
interest expense also includes the proportionate amortization of capitalized debt issue costs associated with the term loans 
the unamortized balance of in debt issue costs is included in other intangible capital assets on the balance sheet 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
before accounting for the itcs  income tax expense for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective income tax rate  before accounting for the itcs and as a percentage of pre tax income  was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate through fiscal was due to a lower uk group tax position  partially offset by higher provincial income taxes in canada 
the fiscal effective tax rate was higher than in fiscal due to the sale of an investment in esprit 
management periodically reviews the virtual certainty or reasonable assurance  as applicable  of realizing the loss and itc carryforward and timing difference benefits in the determination of their accounting recognition 
such review may result in the recording of the accounting benefit for these timing differences and investment tax credit carryforwards  as the circumstances warrant  and the recognition of loss carryforwards  as realized 
management believes there is sufficient evidence of expected profitability from the company s canadian operations in the foreseeable future to provide reasonable assurance for accruing a future benefit of related to itcs 
the accounting for the itcs is more fully described in the investment tax credit section of this management s discussion and analysis 
year the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer systems and products that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
management has formed a year compliance project and program office to establish and ensure mitel s compliance with what is commonly known as the year problem 
in addition  consultants were engaged to assist with a comprehensive review of the company s state of readiness and to assist with any necessary remedial plans for the year date change 
this review encompassed supporting information technology systems  product lines and business supply chain systems and infrastructure 
management presently believes that with modifications to the company s existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management further believes that the cost of either repairing or replacing certain business systems to ensure business continuance beyond year should not have a significant impact on the results of operations 
other than seeking representations and assurances  the company has not made an assessment as to whether any of its customers  suppliers or service providers will be affected by the date change 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted should the company s customers  suppliers or service providers efforts to address the year issue prove to be inadequate 
other the asia pacific region encountered unstable local economies and significant devaluation in its currencies during fiscal this region represented of the company s revenue for the year ended march  and of revenue in fiscal the majority of the asia pacific sales relate to semiconductor operations which have continued to grow in fiscal asia pacific receivables  net of reserves  were approximately of the company s total assets at march  to the extent the asia pacific region grows in importance to the company  or the factors affecting the region begin to adversely affect customers in other geographic locations  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
management periodically evaluates the financial and operational independence of its foreign operations and the resulting accounting classification of the foreign subsidiaries as self sustaining enterprises 
should a foreign subsidiary cease to be classified as self sustaining  then translation gains or losses on consolidating the foreign subsidiary s financial statements would be charged to operating income instead of a separate component of shareholders equity 
the company manages foreign currency risk by protecting the estimated future currency cash flows of each operating division  and certain significant transactions  from adverse foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company does not engage in a trading or speculative hedging program 
interest rate risk is managed by entering into interest rate swap contracts 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on revenues and costs during the last three fiscal years 
backlog as orders are frequently booked and shipped within the same fiscal month  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for the month  quarter or year 
this is most true for the company s business communications systems since manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are generally longer because of the nature of the production process 
at march   order backlog was compared to at march  the increase in backlog was mostly attributable to the acquisition of plessey in the fourth quarter and to increased bcs bookings 
most of the backlog is scheduled for delivery in the next months 
fiscal year ended march backlog the decrease in backlog at the end of fiscal was mainly due to the sale of the thermal print head business in the third quarter of that year 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and short term investment balances of at march  compared to at march  the increase of was mainly due to cash flow provided by operations partially offset by the acquisition of gandalf and fixed asset additions during the year 
the acquisition of plessey was financed by means of senior secured credit facilities 
with the consolidation of plessey  the company s balance sheet reflected a significant increase in total assets from at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal cash flow provided by operations amounted to during fiscal compared to in fiscal since march   the company s working capital  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  increased by primarily due to increased accounts receivable on higher fourth quarter bcs sales and to higher inventory levels necessary to support the growth in the business 
the company maintains a minimum of critical inventory to ensure continuity of supply for its manufacturing requirements 
most of the security supply inventory is carried at the company s semiconductor plants 
fixed asset additions were during fiscal the additions were primarily related to semiconductor manufacturing capacity and technology enhancements as well as continuing improvements to the company s information technology resources 
the bromont semiconductor capacity expansion program is comprised of two phases as described earlier in this management s discussion and analysis 
phase one  which was substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal  cost approximately the total cost of phase two is expected to be at the end of fiscal  approximately was spent on the phase two project 
management expects that fiscal capital expenditures will increase due to normal capital replacement programs and to the effect of consolidating recently acquired operations for a full fiscal year 
other capital assets increased in fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of gandalf on august  purchased r d and other intangible assets totaling was recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
the purchased intangible assets will be amortized over a period of ten years 
in addition  other capital assets increased due to the deferral of debt issue costs of which were incurred with the financing of the plessey acquisition 
these costs will be amortized over the life of the related debt which ranges from five to six years 
during fiscal  certain land in kanata previously held for resale with a carrying value of was reclassified to fixed assets 
management intends to hold the land to meet future requirements 
on june   the company sold the boca raton facility which was previously held as an asset for resale 
the proceeds from the sale  which amounted to  were used to retire the florida industrial revenue and development bonds of  for which the facility was pledged as security 
total long term debt  net of repayments  increased by from the end of fiscal due to two senior secured term loan facilities used to finance the plessey acquisition and which together amounted to us in addition  the company continued to finance a portion of its fixed asset additions through capital leases 
these increases were partially offset by the repayment of the florida industrial revenue bonds on july  the two term loans  respectively the axelssm series b loan and the tranche a term loan  were entered into with a syndicate of banks led by goldman  sachs credit partners lp as the syndication agent and the canadian imperial bank of commerce as the administrative agent 
the axels series b loan will be repaid quarterly on a nominal basis with of the original amount of us due in december the tranche a term loan will be repaid quarterly on a graduated basis over five years and matures on february the term loans are at a variable interest rate based on the lower of a defined base rate or the london inter bank offer rate libor plus a premium 
the company entered into an interest rate swap prior to year end to fix the base interest rate on a portion of each of the term loans 
the interest rate swap is considered to be an effective hedge of the variable interest rates on the term loans 
the company is subject to certain restrictive covenants and commitments and is required to maintain certain financial ratios for the purpose of ensuring the company s ability to meet its obligations under the credit agreement 
the company is subject to certain mandatory prepayments in the event of asset sales other than inventory  equity offerings and debt issuances  certain insurance proceeds and defined excess cash flow 
mandatory prepayments range from to of the net cash proceeds and would be paid on a pro rata basis toward the senior secured term loans 
management believes the company is in compliance with the obligations and restrictive covenants under the credit agreement 
the pension liability of relates to the unfunded pension obligation in mitel semiconductor ab 
under applicable swedish law  companies are not required to fund the pension obligation  but instead operate on a pay as you go basis 
the pension obligation is actuarially determined in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in sweden and is fully insured by a swedish regulatory agency 
as at march   the company s capitalization was comprised of debt  preferred equity  and common equity 
this compares to debt  preferred equity and common equity at the end of fiscal axel is a registered service mark of goldman  sachs co 
in addition to cash and short term investment balances of as at march   the company has an unused revolving credit facility of approximately us 
in accordance with company policy  short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
management believes the company is in a position to meet all foreseeable business cash requirements and debt service from its cash balances on hand  existing financing facilities and cash flow from operations
