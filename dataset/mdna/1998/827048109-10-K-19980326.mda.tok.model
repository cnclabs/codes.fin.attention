item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general the company is a leading north american manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products that currently produces i steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  ii custom designed plastic containers for personal care  health  food  pharmaceutical and household chemical products and iii specialty packaging items  including metal caps and closures  aluminum roll on closures  plastic bowls and paper containers used by processors in the food and beverage industry 
the company is the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit sale market share for the year ended december  of in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for personal care products and a major supplier of metal closures for food and beverage products 
revenue growth the company s strategy is to increase shareholder value by growing its existing businesses and expanding into other segments by applying its expertise in acquiring  financing  integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses 
the company has increased its revenues and market share in the metal container  plastic container and specialty markets through acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result of this strategy  the company has diversified its customer base  geographic presence and product line 
management believes that certain industry trends exist which will enable the company to continue to acquire attractive businesses in its existing markets 
for example  during the past eleven years  the metal container market has experienced significant consolidation due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations 
the company s acquisitions of the metal container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte and finger lakes reflect this trend 
this consolidation trend has continued as evidenced by the company s recent agreement in principle to acquire the metal container manufacturing assets of campbell 
see business recent developments 
the company s plastic container business has also increased its market position from a sales base of million in to million in through strategic acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
the plastic container segment of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  and management intends to pursue consolidation opportunities in that segment  as evidenced by its recent acquisitions of winn and rexam plastics 
management believes that it can successfully apply its acquisition and operating expertise to new segments of the consumer goods packaging industry 
for example  with the roll on closures and an can acquisitions  the company expanded its specialty business into aluminum roll on closures  metal caps and closures and its licensed omni plastic container 
management believes that certain trends in and characteristics of the north american consumer goods packaging industry will continue to generate attractive acquisition opportunities in complementary business lines 
importantly  the industry is fragmented  with numerous segments and multiple participants in the various segments 
many of these segments are experiencing consolidation 
operating performance the company seeks to acquire businesses at reasonable cash flow multiples and to enhance profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
the additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions have enabled the company to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings 
in addition  the company s acquisitions have enabled it to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and minimizing product transportation costs 
the company has also benefited from the economies of its increased purchasing volume and from the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions  as well as from the investment of capital to upgrade the acquired facilities 
in addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses  the company has improved the operating performance of its existing plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
since  the company s operating margins excluding the effect of the non cash stock option charge incurred in in connection with the ipo have increased percentage points to in in order to maintain operating margins at this level  management believes it will be necessary to realize further cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure in the industry 
containers has entered into multi year supply arrangements with many of its customers  including nestle and del monte 
the company estimates that approximately of its projected metal container sales in will be pursuant to such arrangements 
although these multi year supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of material and labor cost changes thereby significantly reducing the exposure of the company s results of operations to the volatility of these costs  these arrangements limit the company s ability to increase margins 
to retain its multi year supply arrangements  historically the company has agreed to price concessions in exchange for term extensions or other modifications to existing contracts 
generally  the company has entered into such an agreement with a customer prior to the date that such customer can receive competitive proposals under its multi year supply arrangement 
these price concessions have not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that future price concessions  if any  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
beginning in december  under the dm supply agreement  which represented approximately of the company s net sales in  del monte may receive proposals from other independent commercial can manufacturers for the supply of all containers for the remainder of the term of the dm supply agreement that containers currently furnishes to del monte at one of del monte s canneries  and containers has the right to match any such proposals 
there can be no assurance that any such proposal will be made at sales prices equivalent to those currently in effect or otherwise on terms similar to those currently in effect 
in addition  the company cannot accurately predict the effect  if any  on its results of operations of matching or not matching any such proposals 
the company s metal container business sales and  to a lesser extent  operating income are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable  tomato and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
the fruit and vegetable pack harvest in was better than the below normal fruit and vegetable pack harvest in  resulting in greater sales to fruit and vegetable pack processing customers in as compared to the vegetable pack was better than in  but due to reduced planting acreage was less than the vegetable pack 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  the company experiences higher unit sales volume in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year and  as a result  has historically generated a disproportionate amount of its annual income from operations during these quarters 
benefits of debt refinancings the company s financial strategy has been to use leverage to support its growth and optimize shareholder returns 
the company s stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of its long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports its financial strategy 
as the company s revenues and operating income have increased and the company s financial position has improved  the company has pursued a refinancing strategy to further improve its cash flow and its operating and financial flexibility 
as part of this strategy  over the past three years the company has refinanced substantially all of its higher cost indebtedness with lower cost indebtedness and equity 
during that period  the company has refinanced all of its discount debentures  notes and higher cost bank debt with proceeds from the ipo  the debentures  the exchange debentures and lower cost bank debt 
see business general financial strategy 
in addition to reducing the company s borrowing costs and extending the maturities of its debt  the new debt facilities improved the company s flexibility to engage in mergers and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock and refinance existing indebtedness 
furthermore  the company s secured credit facilities provide it with a revolving loan facility of million  of which the company anticipates up to million will be used in for its seasonal working capital needs 
the balance of the revolving loan facility is available to the company to pursue its growth strategy or for other permitted purposes 
the company financed the acquisition of winn through the revolving loan facility  and the company intends to finance the acquisition of campbell s can manufacturing assets through the revolving loan facility 
as a result of the refinancings  the company s interest expense for was reduced by  or million  to million as compared to million for the company estimates that interest expense for would have been approximately million  or million less than interest expense for  if all such refinancings had occurred at the beginning of excluding the effect of interest expense on additional borrowings used to finance acquisitions  the company s interest expense for is expected to be less than its interest expense in due to the benefits of such refinancings 
further  the company s financial results are sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
after taking into account interest rate swap arrangements that the company has entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  the company had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
in addition  revolving loans outstanding under the company s secured credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates 
in connection with these refinancings  the company incurred extraordinary charges during the years ended december   and for the write off of unamortized debt financing costs and premiums paid upon the early redemption of debt  net of tax  of million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  as a result of the ipo  the company incurred a non cash stock option charge of million in for the excess of the fair market value at the time of the ipo over the grant price of certain stock options 
income tax considerations historically  the company has incurred minimal income tax liability due to its net operating loss position 
at december   the company had net tax operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which were available to offset future taxable income 
however  beginning in the company expects to become subject to alternative minimum tax at the statutory rate of  and as a result its current tax liability will increase 
for financial accounting purposes the company determined in that it was more likely than not that the future tax benefits arising from its net operating loss carryforwards would be realized in future years due to the company s continued improvement in earnings and probability of future taxable income 
as a result  the company released its deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognized an income tax benefit in consequently  the company s effective tax rate for was significantly less than what it will be in future periods 
for  the company expects to provide for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 
for years prior to  the company s provision for income taxes was based upon federal  state and foreign taxes currently payable

net sales for the plastic container business of million during the year ended december  increased million  or  from net sales of million for the same period in the increase in net sales was attributable to incremental sales generated by the rexam acquisition and significantly higher volume from the existing business 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of consolidated net sales was  million for the year ended december   an improvement of percentage points as compared to  million for the same period in the improvement in the gross profit margin was principally attributable to improved operating efficiencies achieved as a result of benefits realized from the consolidation and integration of the an can facilities  higher production volumes of the plastic container business and capital investment  partially offset by the impact of competitive pricing pressure on both the metal container and the specialty businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales decreased percentage points to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales principally related to increased revenues generated from the recent acquisitions without a commensurate increase in selling  general and administrative cost and the expected lower administrative expenses realized as a result of the completion of the integration of the administrative functions of an can with the company

income from operations as a percentage of net sales for the plastic container business improved percentage points to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in the improvement in the operating performance of the plastic container business was principally attributable to both increased sales and production volumes which resulted in lower per unit manufacturing costs and continued manufacturing efficiencies due to capital investment benefits 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in since  the company has refinanced principally all of its indebtedness with lower cost indebtedness and equity 
the decline in interest expense reflects the benefits of these refinancings  offset in part by additional borrowing costs incurred to finance the purchases of finger lakes  roll on closures and rexam plastics 
because a substantial portion of the refinancings occurred in the summer of  the company expects that its interest expense for the first and second quarters of will be less than the interest expense it incurred in the same periods in income taxes 
during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that future tax benefits arising from its net operating loss carryforwards would be realized in future years due to the company s continued improvement in earnings and the probability of future taxable income

sales of specialty items included in the metal container segment increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  due predominantly to additional sales generated by the former an can operations 
net sales for the plastic container business of million during the year ended december  decreased million from net sales of million for the same period in despite an increase in unit sales  net sales of plastic containers declined as a result of the pass through of lower resin costs 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of consolidated net sales was  million for the year ended december   an improvement of percentage points as compared to million for the same period in the improvement in gross profit margin was principally attributable to synergies realized from the an can acquisition  improved operating efficiencies due to can plant consolidations as well as the improved manufacturing performance by the plastic container business  offset  in part  by the higher cost base of the former an can operations and the realization of higher per unit costs due to the company s one time planned reduction in finished goods inventory 
the additional production capacity provided by an can has enabled the company to produce its product closer to the time of sale and  as a result  during the company reduced the amount of finished goods that it carries 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales remained constant for the years ended december  and december  at million and million  respectively 
despite the incurrence of certain redundant costs  estimated to be million  associated with the integration of the an can operations  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained constant with the prior year

income from operations as a percentage of net sales for the plastic container business improved percentage points to million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the same period in the improvement in the operating performance of the plastic container business was principally attributable to increased production volumes as well as the benefits realized through capital investment and improved production planning and scheduling efficiencies 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december   principally as a result of increased borrowings to finance the acquisition of an can in august  offset  in part  by the benefit realized from the redemption of million of the discount debentures with lower cost bank borrowings additional b term loans of million and revolving loans of million under the previous credit agreement and with million of the proceeds from the preferred stock sale  and by lower average bank borrowing rates 
income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes for the years ended december  and provide for federal  state and foreign taxes currently payable 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in reflects the benefit of the current cash tax savings realized from the deduction of accreted interest on the retired discount debentures 
net income and earnings per share

in  the company incurred an extraordinary charge of million  net of taxes  or per share diluted  for the write off of unamortized debt costs related to the refinancing of its secured debt facilities to fund the an can acquisition  the repurchase of a portion of the discount debentures and premiums paid on the repurchase of a portion of such discount debentures 
capital resources and liquidity the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from its obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with its acquisitions and the refinancing of such indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of the company s seasonal working capital needs 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and revolving loan borrowings 
since august  the company has pursued a refinancing strategy to further improve its cash flow and operating and financial flexibility by refinancing its higher cost indebtedness with lower cost indebtedness and equity 
as part of that strategy  the company refinanced all of its discount debentures and notes and its higher cost bank facility with i proceeds received from the ipo  ii proceeds received by the company from the issuance and sale of million principal amount of its debentures  iii a portion of the proceeds received by the company from the issuance and sale of the exchangeable preferred stock  which the company subsequently exchanged for million principal amount of its exchange debentures  and iv a lower cost bank facility 
in july  the company completed the refinancing of approximately million of existing bank term and revolving loans by entering into a new us senior secured credit facility 
this credit facility provided the company with a total senior secured credit facility of billion  which included million of term loans and a revolving loan facility of million 
the revolving loans are available to the company for its working capital and general corporate purposes including acquisitions 
the new us senior secured credit facility i lowered the interest rates on the company s senior secured borrowings by approximately basis points  ii extended the maturities of the company s a term loans and revolving loans thereunder to december  and b term loans thereunder to june   and iii changed certain covenants to further improve the company s operating and financial flexibility  including changes to provide more flexibility to engage in mergers and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and refinance existing indebtedness 
since the refinancing of the us senior secured credit facility  the interest rate for the company s a term loans and revolving loans has been libor plus or bankers trust s prime lending rate  and basis points higher for the company s b term loans 
these interest rates are reset quarterly based upon the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the company s us senior secured credit facility 
in december  the company s canadian subsidiaries entered into a new secured credit facility to provide the company with more financing flexibility and reduce the company s foreign currency exposure 
the canadian credit facility provided such subsidiaries with approximately million of term loans and up to approximately million of revolving loans 
the term loan proceeds were used to prepay million and million of term loans under the us senior secured credit facility in december and january  respectively 
additionally  as a result of the canadian credit facility  the revolving loan facility under the us senior secured credit facility was reduced by million  the amount of the revolving loan commitment under the canadian credit facility  from million to million 
interest rates for borrowings under the canadian credit facility are generally comparable to interest rates under the us senior secured credit facility 
during  in implementing its refinancing strategy  the company used proceeds of million from the ipo  proceeds of million from the issuance of the debentures  along with borrowings of million under the previous credit agreement  million of term loans under the new us senior secured credit facility and million of borrowings under the canadian credit facility to repay million principal amount of the discount debentures  refinance million of term loans under the previous credit agreement  redeem the notes for million million principal amount  repay million of term loans under the us senior secured credit facility  and pay fees and expenses related to such refinancings of million 
for the year ended december   the company used excess proceeds of million realized from the refinancings referred to above and cash provided by operations of million to repay million principal amount of b term loans and million of revolving loans  make capital expenditures of million net of asset sales  fund the acquisitions of roll on closures and rexam plastics for million  and increase its cash balance by million 
during  cash generated from operations of million  borrowings of million of b term loans under the previous credit agreement  net proceeds of million from the preferred stock sale  net borrowings of working capital loans under the previous credit agreement of million  proceeds of million from the sale of assets and million of cash balances were used to fund capital expenditures of million  the purchase of finger lakes for million and the purchase of anc s st 
louis facility for million  the redemption of million of discount debentures  the repayment of million of term loans under the previous credit agreement  the payment of million of financing costs associated with the borrowing of additional b term loans under the previous credit agreement  and the purchase for million of holdings class b common stock held by mellon bank na  as trustee for first plaza group trust 
during  cash generated from operations of million including cash of million generated by an can during the five month period from its acquisition on august   proceeds of million realized from the sale of assets and a decrease of million in cash balances were used to repay million of working capital borrowings used to fund the acquisition of an can  fund capital expenditures of million  repay million of term loans and million of working capital loans  and make payments to former shareholders of million in full settlement of outstanding litigation 
because the company sells metal containers used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  its sales are seasonal 
as is common in the industry  the company must access working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the summer and fall packing season 
seasonal accounts are generally settled by year end 
due to the company s seasonal requirements  the company incurs short term indebtedness to finance its working capital requirements 
for  the company estimates it will utilize approximately million of its revolving loan facility for seasonal working capital needs 
amounts available under the revolving loan facility in excess of such seasonal working capital needs are available to the company to pursue its growth strategy and for other permitted purposes 
the company financed the acquisition of winn in january through the revolving loan facility  and intends to finance the acquisition of campbell s can manufacturing assets through the revolving loan facility 
see business recent developments 
revolving loan borrowings will be due and payable on december  as of december   there were no revolving loans outstanding  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the unused portion of the revolving loan facility at such date was million 
in addition to its operating cash needs  the company believes its cash requirements over the next several years without taking into account the effect of future acquisitions will consist primarily of i annual capital expenditures of to million  ii annual principal amortization payments of bank term loans under its senior secured credit facilities beginning in of approximately million which includes million that was repaid in january and million that will be repaid no later than april   million  million  million and million  iii expected expenditures of to million over the next few years associated with plant rationalizations  employee severance and administrative workforce reductions  other plant exit costs and employee relocation costs relating to an can  iv the company s interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans under its senior secured credit facilities the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and acquisitions and bank term loans under the senior secured credit facilities  most of which bear fluctuating rates of interest  the debentures and the exchange debentures for which the company intends to make future interest payments in cash  and v payments of approximately million for federal and state tax liabilities in  which will increase annually thereafter 
management believes that cash generated by operations and funds from the revolving loans available under the company s secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service and tax obligations for the foreseeable future 
the company is also continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market  and will likely incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under its revolving loan facility  to finance any such acquisition 
see business recent developments 
the company s secured credit facilities and the indentures with respect to the debentures and the exchange debentures contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur debt  sell assets and engage in certain transactions 
management does not expect these limitations to have a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company is in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in such financing agreements and believes that it will continue to be in compliance during with all such covenants 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on the company  other than to increase its cost of borrowing 
in general  the company has been able to increase the sales prices of its products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials 
see business sales and marketing and operating performance 
because the company has indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  the company s financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   the company had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  taking into account interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest was exchanged for fixed rates of interest based on the three month libor rate  which rate ranges from to 
the notional principal amounts of these agreements totaled million and mature in depending upon market conditions  the company may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in the company s judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge its exposure against interest rate volatility

in year issues year issues result from the inability of some computer programs or computerized equipment to accurately calculate  store or use a date subsequent to december  the erroneous date can be interpreted in a number of different ways  typically the year is interpreted as the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar operations as required by normal business 
the company has recently completed an assessment of its core financial and operational software systems to ensure compliance with year issues 
further assessment of other less critical software systems and various types of equipment is continuing and should be completed by late the company believes that the potential impact  if any  of these systems not being year compliant will at most require employees to manually complete otherwise automated tasks or calculations  and it should not materially impact the company s production or sales activities 
the company has initiated formal communication with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to correct their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has and will utilize both internal and external resources to complete tasks and perform testing necessary to address year issues 
the company plans to complete its year project no later than june  the company does not expect that costs relating to the assessment and remediation of year issues to exceed million
