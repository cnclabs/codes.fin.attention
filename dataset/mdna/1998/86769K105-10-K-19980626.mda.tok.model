item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenues the company classifies its lease transactions  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fasb  as either direct financing or operating leases 
revenue  costs and resulting income are recognized during each of the accounting periods during the term of the lease 
the allocation of income among the accounting periods within a lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification 
the company segregates the sources of its revenue into five categories for financial statement purposes i operating leases  ii direct financing leases  iii sales of new and used equipment  iv fee income  and v interest income 
operating leases 
all leases that are not classified as direct financing leases are treated as operating leases 
monthly billings from these leases are recognized as leasing revenue 
the company s cost of the leased equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to the company s estimate of residual value 
revenue  depreciation expense and the resultant gross margin for operating leases are recorded evenly over the term of the lease 
if the lease is discounted to a financial institution  the related interest expense declines over the term of the lease as the principal is reduced  with the resultant net margin being lower in the early periods of the lease and higher in the later periods 
direct financing leases 
these leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the lessee 
a lease is a direct financing lease if the credit worthiness of the customer and the collectibility of lease payments are reasonably certain and it meets at least one of the following criteria i the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the customer by the end of the lease term  ii the lease contains a bargain purchase option  iii the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or iv the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair value of the leased equipment at inception of the lease 
direct financing leases consist of future lease payments plus the residual value collectively referred to as the gross investment 
residual value is the estimated fair market value at the time of lease termination 
at the inception of a direct finance lease  the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the cost or carrying amount  if different of the leased equipment is recorded as unearned revenue 
the net investment in the lease is the gross investment less unearned revenue 
the unearned revenue is amortized to leasing revenue over the lease term to produce a constant percentage return on the net investment whether or not the lease is discounted to a financial institution 
equipment sales 
revenue from equipment sales transactions is recognized by the company at the time title to the equipment passes to the customer 
leases that entitle the customer to purchase the leased equipment for a nominal sum at the end of the lease term and which are discounted on a nonrecourse basis at the lease commencement date  leaving the company with no interest in the transaction  are treated by the company as a sale of equipment 
fee income 
fee income primarily consists of late fees collected on past due accounts 
interest income 
interest income is accrued on unimpaired loans receivable under the effective interest method 
interest income is not recognized on loans which have been identified by the company as impaired 
financing the company funds its revenue producing assets with a mix of nonrecourse and recourse financing 
as of march   the company s total borrowings of  were comprised of  of nonrecourse and  of recourse debt  or and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company entered into a discretionary revolving credit agreement with national city bank of minneapolis 
the agreement provides for discretionary loan advances up to million based on eligible equipment leases 
advances under the agreement are secured by the eligible equipment leases and are repaid over the term of such eligible equipment leases with interest of above the yield on us treasury securities of equivalent term 
in may  the company borrowed million under this credit facility  and million remains outstanding as of march  during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with king management wherein king management agreed to provide funding for approved vendor leasing programs  including making direct loans  and providing certain subordinations and arranging financing packages for the period july  through june  any direct financing utilized will be on terms as attractive as any other financing facility utilized by the company 
in consideration for the financing commitment  and other services  the company agreed to allow king management to participate in or depending on the level of risk of vendor lease transactions consummated during the agreement term noted above 
during fiscal  king management purchased leases in the amount of  and had made direct loans to sunrise totaling  of which  were outstanding as of march  king management advances of the purchase price  or net book value of the assets  and the interest rate on these loans is at under the prime rate 
subsequent to march   the company extended the term of this agreement for one additional year through june   and the king management financing commitment has been extended to include financing of direct leases with terms of two years or shorter 
the million securitization financing with dougherty dawkins during fiscal has been reduced to a balance of  as of march  in addition to king management s financing commitment described above  as of march   the company had available a million line of credit which matures on september  at march   advances under this line of credit were subject to a borrowing base limitation of  million of which was outstanding 
advances under the line are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the interest rate is at prime  and the company is subject to certain financial and other covenants relating to net worth ratios and liquidity requirements 
the company also utilizes certain of its lease rentals receivable and the underlying equipment in lease transactions as collateral for secured borrowing from financial institutions at fixed rates primarily on a nonrecourse basis 
cash flows from leases cash flows are not affected by how a particular lease is classified  but are affected by the company s decision on how its investment in a particular lease will be financed 
results of operations for the years ended march  and total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million compared to the previous fiscal year 
operating lease revenue continued to show sustained growth with an increase of million compared to the same period in fiscal  which was primarily due to the increase in activity in the company s vendor leasing programs 
direct financing lease revenues decreased million from the previous fiscal year due to fewer new leases being added as compared to the run off of existing leases 
equipment sales increased million as compared to the same period in fiscal total leasing revenues were as follows year ended march  amount amount leasing revenues vendor ilc   direct slc   total   as a percent of total revenues margins from leasing activities leasing revenue  less depreciation and interest expense were  and for the periods ended march   and  respectively 
margins will fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix of direct financing and operating leases 
margins will also be affected by the age of direct finance and operating leases in the current portfolio 
revenue from equipment sales for the period ended march  increased million as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal the gross margin of this activity was approximately breakeven for the current period ended march  as compared to for the same period in fiscal the gross margin decrease was due to losses on sales related to a specific vendor program 
gross margins will vary depending on the company s ability to purchase equipment at competitive prices and to negotiate attractive selling prices for such equipment when the equipment has been returned at the end of the lease term 
interest income decreased  and fee income increased  in fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal interest income continues to decrease due to the cessation of the asset based lending business 
fee income increased primarily as a result of increased late fee collections 
total costs and expenses decreased  less than in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal depreciation increased million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal the increase reflects the continued increase in operating leases 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal this decrease in interest expense reflects lower average borrowings during the period  as well as lower cost of borrowing under king management s financing commitment 
during fiscal  the company incurred  in losses on leases and loans  including  during the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter charges included million reserves on assets originated prior to the merger with ilc  a provision for a fourth quarter negotiated settlement of million of lease transactions which the company had placed into default late in the third quarter  as well as provisions for reserves to cover other leases in default 
also included in the fourth quarter are charges in the amount of  representing a reduction in residual value of assets in a specific vendor program 
in addition  the company will be changing its depreciation method on future asset purchases under this program to better match the accelerating rate of obsolescence 
the impact of these changes will result in a slight decrease in overall margins from leasing activity in future periods 
compensation expense increased  in fiscal versus the same period in fiscal this increase was primarily due to severance accruals including  which will be paid during fiscal year other operating expenses increased  in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal this increase was primarily attributed to accelerating the amortization of capitalized costs incurred in a securitized financing which was completed in fiscal as the result of a merger related arbitration proceeding  on june   the former international leasing corporation shareholders were awarded  additional shares of sunrise common stock for the breach of warranty and  additional shares of sunrise common stock for repayment of attorneys fees 
the charges relating to these awards  were included in the financial statements for fiscal income tax provision as a percentage of income loss before taxes was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the primary reason for the effective tax rates differing from the statutory rates is the lack of deductibility of both the arbitration settlement costs and the related legal costs 
results of operations for the years ended march  and total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by  compared to the previous fiscal year 
operating lease revenue continued to show sustained growth with an increase of million compared to the same period in fiscal  which was primarily due to the increase in activity in the company s vendor leasing programs 
direct financing lease revenues decreased million from the previous fiscal year due to fewer new leases being added as compared to the run off of existing leases 
equipment sales decreased million as compared to the same period in fiscal this decrease is primarily a result of lower off lease sales coming from the vendor leasing business 
interest income and fee income continued to decline as the company continued to wind down its asset based lending business 
total leasing revenues were as follows year ended march  amount amount leasing revenues vendor ilc   direct slc   total   as a percent of total revenues margins from leasing activities leasing revenue  less depreciation and interest expense were  and for the periods ended march   and  respectively 
margins will fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix of direct financing and operating leases 
margins will also be affected by the age of direct finance and operating leases in the current portfolio 
revenue from equipment sales for the period ended march  decreased million as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of lower off lease sales coming from the vendor leasing business 
the gross margin of this activity was for the current period ended march  as compared to for the same period in fiscal gross margins will also vary depending on the company s ability to purchase equipment at competitive prices and to negotiate attractive selling prices for such equipment 
interest income decreased million and fee income decreased  in fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal both of these decreased primarily due to the cessation of the company s asset based lending activities 
total costs and expenses increased million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal this increase reflects the additional amounts recorded as reserves on certain lease and loan transactions and the cost of additional shares issued as part of the arbitration settlement 
depreciation increased million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal the increase was a result of an increase in operating leases 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal this decrease in interest expense reflects lower average borrowings during the period 
during fiscal  the company provided  for losses on lease and loan receivables  including  during the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter provision was made after considering the deteriorating financial condition of one leasing and three loan customers 
the company wrote off or established reserves to reduce the carrying values of these underlying leases and loans to their net estimated realizable values as of march  the collateral underlying these leases and loans consists primarily of casino equipment  a minority share in three limited liability corporations  cash surrender value of three life insurance policies and a golf course and surrounding residential lots 
compensation expense increased slightly with a  change in fiscal versus the same period in fiscal this increase was due to a slight increase in average personnel as well as increases in certain compensation accruals 
other operating expenses increased  in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal this increase was attributed to a significant increase in legal fees relating to the company s dispute with king management corporation 
during fiscal  the former shareholder of international leasing corporation commenced arbitration proceedings against the company related to the february merger of the company with international leasing corporation 
on june   the former international leasing corporation shareholder was awarded  additional shares of sunrise common stock for the breach of warranty and  additional shares of sunrise common stock for repayment of attorneys fees 
income tax provision as a percentage of income loss before taxes was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the tax provision versus a tax benefit from the pre tax loss in fiscal was due principally to the non deductibility of the settlement from the arbitration award 
liquidity and capital resources general the company uses a combination of its credit lines and internally generated cash flows to finance  on an interim basis  the acquisition of revenue generating equipment 
generally  upon commencement of an slc original equipment lease  the company attempts to assign the remaining lease payment stream to a financial institution on a discounted  nonrecourse basis 
in this manner  the company limits its risk  if any  to its equity investment in the loan or equipment 
the discounted lease proceeds received by the company are used to reduce borrowings under the company s credit lines 
where the company finances the equipment cost either internally or on a recourse basis  the company assumes the entire risk on its investment in the loan or equipment 
at march   the company had total borrowings outstanding of million  of which were nonrecourse 
these borrowings consisted of million of discounted lease rentals of which were recourse and of which were non recourse  million of borrowings under bank lines of credit  million under a securitized financing facility  million note payable to a bank  and a total of million of notes payable to king management corporation 
as of march   the company had a total investment in leasing operations of million  which compares to million in fiscal the company s investment in leasing operations was financed through million on non recourse discount lease financing  million of recourse discount lease financing  million notes payable and million generated by internal funds and recourse bank lines of credit 
the company s investment in leasing operations includes equipment held for lease  which consists of equipment for which a lease has been signed but which has not yet commenced 
the amount of equipment held for lease fluctuates significantly depending on the dollar amounts and commencement dates of the company s leases 
the decrease in investment in leasing operations is a result of a decrease in the direct leasing business direct financing leases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march   which includes accounts payable decreasing million 
equipment expenditures of million and a net million reduction in borrowings for fiscal were funded through million of cash flows provided by operating activities and through the collection of million and million in loans and direct financing leases  respectively 
also during significant reductions in discounted lease financings and securitized borrowings were funded by advances from king management 
the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  other than equipment held for lease 
inflation has not been a significant factor in the company s business in any of the periods presented 
liquidity and financing sources the company maintains a million line of credit 
of this amount  million had been utilized as of march  advances under the line bear interest at prime and are collateralized by substantially all of the company s unincumbered assets 
the company s line of credit matures on september  the company believes this credit facility will be renewed on terms similar to the current facility 
the line of credit requires compliance with financial covenants  including the maintenance of certain liquidity and net worth ratios  prohibits the payment of dividends and requires compliance with other financial covenants 
as of march   the company is in compliance with the terms of these agreements 
during fiscal  the company entered into a discretionary revolving credit agreement with national city bank of minneapolis 
the agreement provides for discretionary loan advances up to million based on eligible equipment leases 
advances under the agreement are secured by the eligible equipment leases and are repaid over the term  up to months  of such eligible equipment leases with interest at above the yield on us treasury securities of equivalent term at march  in may  the company borrowed million under this credit facility  of which million was outstanding as of march  during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with king management wherein king management agreed to provide funding for approved vendor leasing programs  including making direct loans  and providing certain subordinations and arranging financing packages for the period july  through june  any direct financing utilized will be on terms as attractive as any other financing facility utilized by the company 
in consideration for the financing commitment  and other services  the company agreed to allow king management to participate in specific percentages of vendor lease transactions consummated during the agreement term noted above 
during fiscal  king management purchased leases in the amount of  and made direct loans to sunrise totaling  of which  were outstanding as of march  subsequent to march   the company has extended the term of this agreement for one additional year through june   and king management s financing commitment has been extended to include financing of direct leases with terms of two years or shorter 
based on the financing commitments from king management  the borrowing capacity under the bank line and its recent success in obtaining additional discount financing  the company believes that it will be able to finance its anticipated equipment purchasing commitments in fiscal the company continues to monitor several problem leases and loans 
while there are leases and loans payable to the company which could force the company to take additional write offs  management does not currently believe that any such write offs  other than the loan described below  would be material or that they would create new covenant violations on current credit facilities or otherwise limit or reduce the company s access to credit 
outlook certain statements contained in this outlook section and other sections of this document are forward looking  based on current expectations  and actual results may differ materially 
the forward looking statements  in particular the statements regarding growth of the company s vendor leasing business  the company s ability to finance its business  and management s belief that any future loan or lease write off will not be material  involve a number of risks and uncertainties including the company s reliance on a few large vendors for its business  its ability to cope with accelerating obsolescence  and to remarket its off lease equipment at prices that are equal to or better than its book value 
in addition to the factors discussed above which could cause actual results to differ from those projected other factors which could cause actual results to differ from expected include the following future growth 
the company s ability to grow at an acceptable rate is dependent to a great extent on the expansion of its vendor leasing business 
the company s ability to expand its vendor business is dependent upon successfully servicing existing vendor accounts and attracting new vendor accounts 
as of march   the company had only two significant vendor leasing programs and has signed agreements for ten other vendor leasing programs 
while the company believes it has the ability and capacity to develop large vendor leasing programs  other than the two it is currently servicing there is no assurance that it will be successful in this regard or that it will be able to generate acceptable revenue growth 
in order to broaden the base of potential lessees the company has redefined its underwriting policies 
these policy changes result in a greater focus on very short term leases year  expanding our business with customers that traditionally are of lower credit quality  and accepting significantly larger transactions from credit worthy customers at rates which are lower than usual 
these changes will result in an increased level of transaction and portfolio risk for the company and an increased reliance on recourse financing 
highly competitive industry 
the equipment leasing business is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous companies  including leasing companies  commercial banks and financial institutions  some of which the company relies on to obtain capital to finance its leases 
most of the company s competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company typically chooses not to compete with large leasing companies for those leases in which the cost of the equipment greatly exceeds the amount of nonrecourse financing available 
risk of additional loan and lease write offs 
while the company believes that its current reserves are adequate  it continues to monitor closely a restructured loan and a material lease  as to which the company has a book value of million and a remaining investment of million 
while lessee payments are being received on a monthly basis there is no assurance that such payments will continue on an uninterrupted basis or that the company is adequately secured 
any future losses on such loans and lease incurred in excess of the company s reserves would likely materially affect the company s future earnings and cash flows  and may cause the company to be in violation of one or more of its covenants under its credit agreements with its financing sources 
financing 
the company s growth and profitability are dependent to a great extent on the company s ability to finance revenue producing assets 
the king management corporation s financing commitment  as well as continued reduction in the amount of non performing assets  have enhanced the company s ability to obtain required financing 
while the company has been successful in obtaining required recourse and non recourse financing to date  there is no assurance that all required financing will be available in the future 
major customers vendors 
at march  and march  no leases outstanding to any individual lessee exceeded o the total lease portfolio  except in cases where the leases had been discounted without recourse to a financial institution 
however  of the company s total leasing revenue for the year ended march  was generated through a single vendor leasing program 
should this program terminate  the company would continue to realize related revenues for a period of up to three years 
if the company is unable to replace this business  the company s future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
residual values of leased equipment 
the value of the data processing equipment leased by the company to its customers represents a substantial portion of the company s capital 
at the inception of each lease  the company estimates the residual value of the leased equipment  which is the estimated market value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the actual realized residual value of leased equipment may differ from its estimated residual value  resulting in profit or loss when the leased equipment is sold or leased again at the end of the initial lease term 
if a lessee defaults on a lease which has been discounted by the company to a financial institution  the financial institution may foreclose on its security interest in the leased equipment and the company may not realize any portion of such residual value 
in addition  the high technology equipment which comprises the bulk of the company s lease portfolio is subject to rapid technological obsolescence typical of the computer industry 
during the past fiscal year  the company has experienced losses on a specific vendor program and established reserves to cover anticipated losses in future periods 
in addition  the company will be depreciating future equipment acquisitions from this vendor program more quickly 
the trend towards shortened product life cycles will continue to add additional risk to maintaining historical leasing margins
