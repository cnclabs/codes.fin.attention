item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of atp and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general on october   tpg merged with lunn under the name advanced technical products  inc immediately after the merger  the former stockholders of lunn owned approximately of atp and the former stockholders of tpg owned approximately of atp 
for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as a purchase of lunn by tpg and the results of operations of lunn since november  have been included in the consolidated financial statements of atp 
tpg was formed in to acquire the brunswick business  which acquisition was completed on april  the selected consolidated financial data for presents the four month period prior to the acquisition of the brunswick business and the eight month period subsequent to such acquisition 
historically  approximately of atp s products and services have been sold to the united states government through prime contracts directly with governmental agencies  primarily the dod  or through subcontracts with other governmental contractors 
during the mid s  the defense industry began to be negatively impacted by a perceived reduction of threats from the former soviet union and affiliated countries in eastern europe 
in addition  increased competition for the united states federal budget dollars resulted in a reduction in real dollars in the united states defense budget over the last decade 
defense spending has recently begun to stabilize and management of atp believes that budgeted procurement spending will increase slightly over the next few years 
the contraction of the defense budget over the last decade and the resulting excess capacity and intensified competition among defense contractors has resulted in significant industry consolidation 
atp s strategy includes the pursuit of acquisitions which will increase its revenue base and improve its cost competitiveness through reduced overhead costs  facility consolidations and the elimination of other duplicative costs 
management of atp believes continued defense industry consolidations will create opportunities for selected acquisitions that will allow atp to further increase its revenue base and enhance its cost competitive position 
however  because of the uncertainty of the nature and size of these opportunities  as well as atp s leverage  there can be no assurances that the financing necessary to pay for acquisitions can be obtained 
although the long term impact of industry consolidation and the defense spending budget cannot be predicted with certainty  management of atp believes that it is positioned to further its presence in the united states defense industry and increase its ongoing diversification efforts into foreign defense markets and selected commercial markets 
the united states government s fiscal year begins on october and contracts and options on contracts are generally awarded just prior to its year end 
the lead time to perform the necessary design work  procure material and begin production is generally several months  which can create a period of low production  revenue and profits in the first half of each fiscal year of atp 
over the last years  the percentage of sales and operating earnings excluding corporate general and administrative expenses generated in the second half of the year have been as follows earnings before year sales interest taxes results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of the income statement expressed as a percentage of revenues 
eight months year ended four months ended ended april  december  december  revenues cost of sales gross profit general and administrative and other expenses operating income interest expense income loss before income taxes and extraordinary items income tax provisions benefit income loss before extraordinary items extraordinary item loss on debt refinancing net income loss year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues decreased million  or from in to million in the decrease in was primarily due to i the completion of a major chemical detection contract in late  and ii the delay in the production of a major shelter contract caused by design changes mandated by the customer 
these decreases were partially offset by the production related to an ordnance contract in gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased from in to in this was primarily attributable to the substantial completion of two major contracts in which had gross margins substantially higher than those of the contracts that replaced them in this was partially offset by improved performance in the ngv business 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or from million in to in this decrease results primarily from a decrease in incentive compensation expense from million in to in additionally  in response to lower revenues  certain other general and administrative expenses were eliminated 
excluding incentive compensation expense  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were approximately for both years 
interest expense decreased approximately million or  as result of lower interest rates obtained in a refinancing in late  offset by higher average loan balances 
the decrease of million in income taxes from million in to million in results from lower earnings as the effective rate remained at 
the extraordinary charge of million in was the result of costs incurred in connection with a refinancing in late year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues on a combined basis increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased shipments during of chemical agent detectors under a contract with the united states army 
approximately of the increase was a result of increased commercial sales  consisting primarily of ngv tanks 
year ended december  compared with the eight months ended december  gross profit as a percent of sales increased from in to in as a result of i a more favorable sales mix of higher profit contracts in  and ii an increase in production efficiency attributable to the commercial segment 
operating income increased as a percentage of sales from in to in  as a result of higher annualized sales absorbing more fixed general and administrative costs 
interest expense decreased from an average of approximately  a month in to approximately  a month in based primarily on lower average loan balance outstanding 
an extraordinary loss of million after tax was recorded in for costs incurred in connection with a debt refinancing 
financial condition and liquidity working capital increased by million from million in to million in as a result of i an increase in inventory and accounts receivable of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in short term debt of million excluding debt assumed in the merger  ii an increase in depreciation of million as a result of capital additions over the last couple of years  and iii the increase in working capital components acquired in the merger 
the increase of million in accounts receivable results from higher than normal sales in the month of december 
the increase in inventory of million resulted from a build up of inventory on a major shelter contract that was delayed in and the start up and tooling costs related to several major contracts that will come on stream in late as a result of these working capital increases  cash flow from operations were basically at break even 
cash flow of million used in investing activities was a result of i million of normal sustaining capital expenditures and ii million of capital expenditures made in connection with the merger 
in march  atp received a commitment from a bank to refinance atp s existing million of credit facilities 
these facilities are comprised of i a term loan of million  ii a deferred obligation of million  iii a combined revolving lines of credit of million  and iv a capital expenditure line of credit of million 
the term loan and the deferred obligation will be replaced with a term loan of million payable quarterly based on a seven year amortization period 
the combined lines of credit  which will be based on atp s accounts receivable and inventory balances  will be replaced with a new million revolving line of credit 
the capital expenditure line of credit will be replaced with a million line of credit 
the total credit facility of million will initially be in place for a period extending to december  
interest rates will vary  based on performance of atp  but should be favorable to the existing rates by at least one percentage point going forward 
at december   atp s backlog of orders and long term contracts was approximately million compared to million at december  the backlog includes scheduled or released orders of approximately million compared to million at december  the backlog includes both firm orders supported by customer purchase orders with fixed delivery dates and blanket orders against which customers issue production releases 
the increase in the backlog reflects i a change in management s strategy  since acquiring the brunswick business in  to obtain longer term contracts than its predecessor  ii improved economic conditions in the aerospace industry  and iii the military s commitment to develop systems to combat chemical warfare 
the backlog is subject to customer rights of cancellation or rescheduling 
however  in most contracts involving the military  atp would be entitled to receive cancellation payments 
generally the backlog does not include future sales of commercial products since they are normally shipped on order and are not subject to long term contracts 
atp has a significant amount of unused manufacturing capacity and therefore generally does not anticipate large annual sustaining capital requirements although  there will be years when improvements or expansions will be necessary 
also  atp will be looking for opportunistic acquisition candidates that will enhance the current operations 
management of atp believes that cash flow generated from operations and the new million credit facility are adequate to sustain atp s current operating level and future short term growth 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
some of such risks and uncertainties are described below 
dependence on principal industries 
the revenues of atp are concentrated in the aerospace and defense industries 
sales to non aerospace and non defense industries  although growing  are anticipated to approximate of total revenues of atp for the foreseeable future 
atp s success will be heavily dependent on its ability to successfully obtain major new defense orders currently planned to be released by the united states government and government prime contractors  as well as the continued strength of the aerospace industry  particularly the commercial aircraft industry 
no assurances can be given that atp will be able to successfully obtain all or even a major portion of the targeted defense industry orders anticipated to be placed 
the commercial aerospace industry is a cyclical business and the demand by commercial airlines for new aircraft is highly dependent upon a variety of factors  which historically have been related to the stability and health of the united states and world economies 
although the aerospace and commercial aircraft industries are currently enjoying a significant upturn in business coupled with receipt of numerous major long term orders  there can be no assurances that the situation will continue in the future 
risks of reductions or changes in military expenditures 
the primary customers of atp are agencies of the dod 
sales under contracts with the dod or under subcontracts that identify the dod as the ultimate purchaser represented approximately of atp s revenues 
the united states defense budget has declined in real terms since the mid s  resulting in some delays in new program starts  program stretch outs and program cancellations 
the united states defense budget has begun to stabilize and even increase in real dollars over the last several years 
a major portion of atp s dod business is expected to be funded by the procurement and research  development  test and evaluation segments of the defense budget 
procurement and research  development  test and evaluation funding has been significantly reduced over the last decade but is expected to remain relatively stable or grow slightly over the next decade 
a significant portion of atp s dod business is also expected to be funded by the operations and maintenance portion of the dod budget  which has declined less than the other segments 
a further significant decline or reallocation of the procurement  research  development  test and evaluation or operations and maintenance segments of the dod budget could materially and adversely affect atp s sales and earnings 
the loss or significant curtailment of atp s material united states defense contracts would also materially and adversely affect atp s future sales and earnings 
competition 
the market for atp s products is highly competitive 
atp competes with numerous competitors  a number of which possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources 
continued consolidation of major aerospace companies could result in program cancellations as well as increased demand for price concessions 
this  together with increased competition for available business  could translate into downward pressure on gross margins with resulting lower overall profit margins 
vendor prices for production materials such as resins  liquid and film adhesives  reinforcing fiber materials and other materials and supplies could increase as demand for aircraft parts and assemblies increase to match higher build rates for commercial aircraft 
higher material prices and demand for lower aircraft part and assembly prices could place increasing pressure on atp s operating margins and net income 
although management of atp believes that the merger has enhanced atp s competitiveness  there can be no assurance that atp will be able to compete successfully in the future 
financial leverage 
atp has a significant amount of indebtedness  which could make it difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes 
moreover  the terms of atp s indebtedness impose various restrictions and covenants on atp which could potentially limit atp s ability to respond to market conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities 
atp s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce total debt will be dependent upon its future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general conditions in the aerospace and defense industries and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of atp  many of which will be beyond its control 
year issues atp is conducting a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is implementing its plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of atp s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
atp presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for atp s computer systems as so modified and converted and that such modifications and conversions will not have a material adverse effect on atp s financial condition or results from operations
