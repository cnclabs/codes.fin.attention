the reduction in food cost as a percentage of sales in was primarily the result of food programs implemented in the restaurants which better managed the restaurant product rotation while maintaining a quality offering to the guest and an increase in the average check

a reduction of approximately of sales in labor primarily accounted for the improved relationship of restaurant operating expenses to net sales in the reduction resulted from reduced restaurant level bonus payouts from the company s bonus plan  which ties bonus payouts to achieving planned profit  from improved labor controls  including the introduction of a revised hourly labor matrix  implemented at the restaurants in and from a higher average check

the company based its reserve analysis on sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of which establishes standards to identify and measure impairment of long lived assets 
management believes the company s adoption of sfas no 
concurrent with the company s development of a restructuring plan did not alter the amount or components of the plan and  as a result  the adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or operations

the company recorded a  restructuring charge for two of the restaurants which consisted of a  non cash charge for the write down of assets to fair market value at one restaurant that was not previously impaired and a  charge for estimated cash costs associated with restaurant closures and settlement of lease obligations for both restaurants

in  the company recorded a  impairment charge for one other restaurant in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company estimated fair value for the restaurant s assets was based on the present value of expected future cash flows at the restaurant 
the company reviews the cash flow of each restaurant throughout any given reporting period  and performs an impairment review of its investment in property and equipment at any given restaurant during a reporting period if deemed necessary based on the restaurant s cash flow performance 
at least annually  the company conducts an impairment review of its investment in property and equipment for all of its restaurants

in  the company computed the tax benefit on its operating loss at an effective tax rate which varies from the expected combined federal and state statutory rate 
the valuation allowance as well as lost state carryforwards account for the variance between the company s effective tax rate and the statutory rate each year 
the company is maintaining a full valuation allowance against any unused deferred tax assets  including its remaining net operating loss carryforwards  until it becomes more likely than not  in management s assessment  that the deferred tax assets will be realized

in addition  the company s quarterly results of operations have been  and may continue to be  materially impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and by restaurant closings 
the fourth quarter normally includes weeks of operations as compared with weeks for each of the three prior quarters 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income in the fourth quarter are not comparable to results in each of the first three fiscal quarters  and net sales and income can be expected to decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year in comparison to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year

the company s continued growth depends to a significant degree on its ability to open new restaurants and to operate such restaurants profitably 
the company intends to continue its restaurant expansion  assuming its financial performance continues to improve 
the company s ability to implement an expansion strategy will depend upon a variety of factors  including the continued success of efforts to restore profitability and the company s ability to obtain funds 
see business business risks expansion 
the company believes its operating cash requirements and near term capital requirements for restaurant expansion and remodeling can be met through existing cash balances  cash provided by operations  equipment lease financing and its available line of credit and term loan agreement 
the company may seek additional debt or equity financing to provide greater flexibility toward improving its operating performance and continuing expansion 
inflation many of the company s crewmembers are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage could materially increase the company s labor costs 
the federal minimum wage increased effective september  and the state of california minimum wage increased march  there are currently no further scheduled increases in the federal or state minimum wage 
in addition  the cost of food commodities utilized by the company are subject to market supply and demand pressures 
shifts in these costs may have a significant impact on the company s food costs 
the company anticipates that increases in these costs can be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there is no assurance that the company would be able to pass such costs on to its guests or that even if it were able to do so  it could do so in a short period of time 
year software requirements the company has completed a review of all its restaurant and corporate computer systems for compliance with the year the company has determined that certain of its existing computer systems use only two digits to identify a year in the date field and  as a result  may improperly identify the year in calculating and processing information 
the company recognizes this system design could cause certain systems to potentially fail or create erroneous results by or at the year but believes its current strategic information plan is addressing the problem 
the company is currently in the process of migrating its critical processing and information requirements to outsourced processing companies whose software is represented to be year compliant 
the company expects to complete this system migration  begun in  during with no significant incremental costs 
in accordance with its strategic information plan  the company is already replacing certain restaurant systems  primarily its restaurant point of sale system  used for capturing and transmitting data to the outsourced systems  with year compliant systems 
the company expects to have the critical restaurant systems in place by approximately the end of at an estimated cost of  which is to be capitalized in accordance with normal policy and is being funded through operating cash flow 
the company has also contacted outside entities with which it interacts electronically and has requested information regarding whether or not their systems are or will be year compliant 
the company plans to monitor the progress of outside entities that are in the process of developing year compliance  but it does not believe there is a material risk to the company if these entities do not achieve compliance
