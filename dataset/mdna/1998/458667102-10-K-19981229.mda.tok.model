the foregoing statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of the extent to which such sources will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements is subject to a number of uncertainties including the ability of the company s operations to generate sufficient cash to support operations  and other uncertainties described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uncertainties relating to forward looking statements 
year the year problem is pervasive and complex  with the potential to cause systems failures and business process interruption resulting from the use of digit date formats as the year changes from to throughout fiscal and  the company has been addressing the risks associated with its information technology it and non information technology non it systems as the year approaches 
in addition to the company s own systems  the company relies  directly and indirectly  on external systems of its customers  suppliers  financial organizations  utilities providers and government entities collectively  third parties 
consequently  the company could be affected by disruptions in the operations of third parties with which the company interacts 
furthermore  the purchasing frequency and volume of customers or potential customers may be affected by year correction efforts as companies expend significant efforts to make their systems year compliant 
the company is using both internal and external resources to a assess the company s state of readiness including the readiness of third parties with which the company interacts with respect to the year problem  b estimate the cost to correct and or replace non compliant internal it and non it systems  c assess the known risks and consequences related to failure to correct any year problems identified  and d develop a contingency plan  if advisable  to address the company s year exposure 
the company s board of directors has established a committee to review the company s efforts to address its year issues and report back to the board at each board meeting 
the company has tested all current versions of its products to determine whether such products are year compliant 
the company believes that all of its current products are year compliant 
earlier versions of the company s products can be classified as either a known to be year compliant  b known to not be year compliant  or c not tested for year compliance 
the company has no plans to make earlier versions of its products year compliant and  in cases where the end user of a non compliant product is known  has made attempts to contact the customer 
in cases where the product has been sold through a reseller  the end user is not known and therefore  cannot be contacted 
if any of the company s customers are unable to make their it systems year compliant in a timely fashion  they may suspend further product purchases from the company until their systems are year compliant 
because most of the company s customers are fortune companies and banking and finance institutions  the company expects most of its customers will become year compliant in a timely fashion  although the company is not in a position to monitor their progress 
all of the company s critical vendors have been queried as to their year preparedness 
for the few that have not responded satisfactorily  alternative sources are being sought and will be in place by june the company has completed the assessment of its principal internal it software systems and its personal computer and network hardware and software for year compliance 
the company is in process of replacing its accounting software and igk s customer order tracking system with third party products 
the company believes that these systems will be replaced by june and that its principal internal it software systems and its personal computer and network hardware and software will be year compliant by june the company believes its principal non it systems are year compliant and that its exposure with respect to the year compliance of its non it systems will not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has incurred costs of approximately  to date and presently expects to incur an additional  in the future to address year compliance issues 
such costs consist primarily of the cost of replacing non compliant internal it system software and upgrading or replacing non compliant personal computer and network hardware and software  but do not include internal staff costs  which the company has not separately tracked 
the company would have incurred many of the costs for these efforts in any event because of the normal process of internal it system upgrades 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of uncertainties  which could result in actual costs exceeding the estimated amounts including  but not limited to  undetected errors or defects discovered in the remediation process or unanticipated difficulties in completing the remediation in a timely fashion 
while the company believes that its efforts to address year issues for which it is responsible should be successful  a description of its most reasonably likely worse case year scenarios have been described above 
in addition  it is possible that there will be undetected errors or defects associated with year in the company s current products and internal systems or those of its principal vendors 
if any of the foregoing scenarios should occur  it is possible that the company could be involved in litigation 
in addition  although the company does not believe that it has any obligation to make prior versions of its products year compliant  it is possible that its customers may take a contrary position and initiate litigation 
because of the relative lack of litigation concerning the year issue  it is uncertain how the company may be affected by such issues 
in the event of litigation or one or more of the worst case year scenarios described above  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
uncertainties relating to forward looking statements item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and other parts of this form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  based on current management expectations 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed in this section 
factors that could cause future results to differ from these expectations include general economic conditions particularly related to demand for the company s products and services  changes in company strategy  product life cycles  competitive factors including the introduction or enhancement of competitive products  pricing pressures  the company s success in and expense associated with developing  introducing and shipping new products  software defects and latent technological deficiencies in new products  changes in operating expenses  inability to attract or retain consulting  sales and or engineering talent  changes in customer requirements  evolving industry standards  and the impact of undetected errors or defects associated with the year date functions on the company s current products and internal systems
