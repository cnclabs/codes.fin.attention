in management of net interest margin net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest expense paid for the funding sources used to finance those assets 
changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the rates earned and paid  respectively  on those assets and liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax exempt loans and securities

interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis 
in  short term interest rates  defined as the fed funds rate and one month libor  began the year at  rose slightly in the first quarter of the year and then stabilized and began gradually declining by approximately basis points during the third and fourth quarters 
in and  short terms rates fluctuated narrowly in the range for the entire period while the prime rate for the three year period was virtually unchanged in the range 
in an effort to increase market share during  first midwest introduced certain new deposit account products at higher introductory rates and maturities that extended into mid to late as a result  during  net interest bearing liabilities  exclusive of short term borrowings  sustained higher average balances than in the subsequent two year period as some of the introductory funds ran off 
additionally  as a result of the higher rates paid on these new products  the net interest margin fell to in from in also contributing to the decline in was a higher level of more expensive  wholesale short term funding 
as interest rates declined in late and stabilized during the and periods  the rates paid on total interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points in to followed by an additional basis point decrease in to 
the decrease was due to the combination of the general drop in interest rates  the runoff of the higher rates paid on new products in and a planned reduction in the more expensive short term borrowings during each of and  with such funding being replaced by less expensive  core deposit funding 
furthermore  as a result of continued loan growth in both and  the overall rate on total interest earning assets decreased by only basis points in to from in and increased basis points in to 
as a result  net interest margin has improved to in from in and in the following sections entitled risk sensitivity management and funding and liquidity management describe the techniques used by first midwest in managing its net interest income and net interest margin 
rate sensitivity management first midwest s earning assets and funding sources do not respond uniformly to changing market interest rates because of the differing interest rate  repricing and maturity characteristics of the various balance sheet categories of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk is the degree to which these market interest rate fluctuations can affect net interest income 
while there are several ways in which to analyze interest rate risk  the traditional method is called a gap analysis 
a gap analysis is a static management tool used to identify mismatches or gaps in the repricing of assets and liabilities within specified periods of time 
first midwest s gap analysis as of december  is presented in table earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented within selected time intervals over a one year forward period based upon their repricing and maturity characteristics 
in a perfectly matched gap analysis  an equal amount of rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be reflected as repricing within each given time interval 
a positive interest rate sensitivity gap indicates more assets than liabilities will reprice in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities will reprice 
table analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  days days days days rate sensitive assets rsa     rate sensitive liabilities rsl     interest sensitivity gap gap rsa less rsl incremental     cumulative     cumulative  excluding savings and now accounts     rsa rsl ratio gap total assets cumulative gap total assets cumulative  excluding savings and now accounts the preceding table reflects a cumulative liability sensitive balance sheet over a one year time frame which likely will more positively affect net interest income if interest rates fall than if they rise 
however  while the gap analysis is widely used in the industry  it is unable to capture other factors affecting the sensitivity of the balance sheet  such as the time lags required for certain assets and liabilities to reprice because of their varying sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  included in the total for rate sensitive liabilities are  in savings and now accounts 
while immediately repriceable  the rates paid on these deposit accounts will not change in direct correlation with changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
for example  if first midwest s base lending rate declines by basis points  the interest rate paid on these deposits will not immediately decline by the full basis points 
conversely  if lending rates increase by the same amount  the rates paid on these deposits will likewise not increase immediately or by the full basis points 
for the reasons noted above  a static gap analysis has limitations in its usefulness and its ability to effectively present the rate sensitivity of a balance sheet 
accordingly  first midwest uses a more dynamic approach to measuring interest rate risk by conducting simulations that demonstrate the changes that would occur in net interest income under different interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this form of modeling is conducted monthly  involves adjustments to balance sheet volumes over a to month forward period  incorporates a repricing analysis of earning assets and funding sources and considers certain other off balance sheet hedging vehicles such as interest rate exchange agreements swaps  as further described below 
furthermore  first midwest has generally followed a policy of maintaining a balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  making each side of the balance sheet approximately equally flexible in reacting to changes in market interest rates so that net interest income will not be adversely affected by more than  regardless of whether interest rates rise or fall rapidly 
the simulations described above  coupled with the policy guidelines intended to limit the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates  provide guidance to first midwest as it might adjust its strategies based on its projections of the future interest rate environment to ensure maximization of net interest income 
the net interest income simulation model used by first midwest to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates utilizes interest rate scenarios that show interest rates rising by basis points  falling by basis points and remaining flat over a to month horizon 
additionally the model has the capability of determining the affect on net interest income of an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of derivative and other financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  deposit sensitivity and first midwest s capital plans 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and strategies  among other factors 
furthermore  first midwest also believes that immediate and sustained changes in interest rates will not necessarily impact all interest bearing liabilities in the same fashion 
as discussed above  an immediate increase or decrease in first midwest s base lending rate may not result in an immediate  identical increase in rates paid on non maturing  not indexed interest bearing liabilities such as savings accounts and now accounts 
accordingly  first midwest analyzes the impact of immediate and sustained parallel changes in interest rates both including and excluding non maturing  non indexed deposits 
based on the results of its simulation model  as of december   exclusive of non maturing  non indexed deposits  first midwest would expect a decrease in net interest income of 
and an increase in net interest income of if interest rates experienced an immediate increase or decrease  respectively  by basis points over a month period 
if non maturing  non indexed deposits were included in this analysis and were immediately affected by such increase or decrease in interest rates  the reduction in net interest income from a rise in rates of basis points would be while an improvement in net interest income of would result from a reduction in interest rates of basis points 
first midwest believes that its interest rate sensitivity position is appropriate given the current economic and interest rate environment 
as a part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  first midwest has entered into interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit variations in net interest income 
first midwest has also utilized interest rate exchange agreements referred to as basis swaps to lock in spreads on its prime rate based loan portfolios 
the advantages of using interest rate swaps include the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  enhancement of net interest margin and the ability to customize the interest rate swap agreement to meet desired risk parameters 
interest rate swap transactions involve exchanges of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional ie  principal amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
the net cash flow paid or received by first midwest on these transactions is treated as an adjustment to the interest income and expense on the underlying earning asset or funding source to which the swap relates 
additionally  the basis swaps have embedded interest rate caps caps which limit the interest rate received on such swaps 
these swaps receive interest at libor and pay interest at the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal less basis points 
the weighted average rate being received by first midwest at year end was while paying on the  notional amount of the basis swaps 
the caps are programmed to increase at a rate of basis points per quarter 
the primary risk associated with interest rate swap transactions is credit risk  or the ability of the swap counterparty to perform its interest payment obligation under the terms of the agreement 
credit risk on the interest rate swap transactions consists of the aggregate net interest payable to first midwest by the counterparty in addition to the aggregate unrealized gain on the swap position 
first midwest controls this credit risk by maintaining a policy limiting credit exposure to any one counterparty to not more than of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  first midwest s interest rate swap transactions generally require the establishment of a mutual mark to market arrangement whereby cash collateral may be required to be on deposit with first midwest and or the agreement s counterparty 
as of december   first midwest had total interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  in place  hedging various balance sheet categories 
the specific terms of these swaps as well as the fair value are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page first midwest does not act as an intermediary in arranging interest rate swaps for customers 
funding and liquidity management liquidity management is the ability to provide funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal and loan demand needs 
first midwest s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed so as to maintain flexibility to respond to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the board of directors 
while asset liquidity provides funds through the maturity and sale of loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  another source of liquidity is liability liquidity  consisting primarily of interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposits as well as repurchase agreements 
other liability funding sources potentially include funds purchased facilities available thorough certain correspondent banks and funding through the discount window borrowings facilities of the federal reserve system 
the following table provides a year to year comparison of the sources of first midwest s liability funding based upon average balances over the last three years 
average  rather than period end  balances are more meaningful in analyzing first midwest s funding sources because of the inherent fluctuations that occur on a monthly basis within most deposit categories 
table funding sources average balances of of of total total total demand deposits    savings deposits    now accounts    money market accounts    time deposits in denominations of or less    core deposits    time deposits in denominations of or more    repurchase agreements    funds purchased and other short term borrowings 
   total funding sources    although average liability funding sources  consisting of core deposits and borrowed funds  decreased in and in total  core deposits increased in and experienced a modest reduction in the reduction in total funding sources was primarily a result of the previously discussed planned reduction in more expensive repurchase agreements and short term borrowings  while the reduction in core deposits in was due to stronger competition for funds in the markets served by the company  primarily the chicago suburban banking market

maximum amount outstanding at weighted average interest rate any month end december  repurchase agreements    funds purchased    other short term borrowings    years ended december  aggregate short term borrowings average amount outstanding    weighted average interest rate paid for each year historically  first midwest has made extensive use of repurchase agreements as a deposit surrogate because this funding source is not subject to the reserve requirements applicable to interest bearing deposits and has also realized direct cost savings because fdic insurance premiums were not assessed on these funding sources 
during first midwest reduced its reliance on repurchase agreements as a funding source 
while interest rates declined and then leveled off during the mid through period  costs of this funding source became more expensive relative to both core deposit funding and other short term borrowing sources resulting in a greater reliance on funds purchased and fhlb advances 
the liquidity needs of first midwest parent company consist primarily of operating expenses and dividend payment to first midwest s stockholders 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from affiliates  but liquidity also can be supplemented by fees assessed to affiliates  a practice which has not been utilized in recent years 
the parent company has short term credit facilities available to fund cash flow needs totalling  at december  the parent company also has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt 
the parent company had no debt outstanding as of year end analysis of net overhead noninterest income noninterest income  exclusive of net security gains  increased by and in and  respectively  reflecting improvements in virtually all categories  as further discussed below 
the following table analyzes the components of noninterest income  excluding net security gains  for the years through table analysis of noninterest income years ended december  change service charges on deposit accounts    trust and investment management fees    other service charges  commissions and fees 
   mortgage banking revenues    other income    total noninterest income    for a discussion of security gains  refer to the securities portfolio section located on page service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of noninterest income  consists of fees on both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts as well as charges for items such as insufficient funds  overdrafts and stop payment requests 
service charges on deposit accounts include both hard dollar charges and charges assessed through account analysis  the latter of which is reduced by earnings credits indexed to a short term treasury yield and is generally applicable to commercial deposit accounts 
the increase of  or  in and or in were due to higher service charges on both business and personal accounts and higher returned check fees received 
the trust company provides trust and investment management services to its customers  acting as executor  administrator  trustee  agent  and in various other fiduciary capacities for client accounts 
trust and investment management fees generally follow the amount of total assets under management as well as conditions in the equity and credit markets because fees are often assessed on the market value of managed funds 
assets under management totaled billion at december  up from billion at year end and billion at year end changes in trust assets under management from year to year result from a combination of growth in new business  offset by attrition  in addition to market conditions impacting the valuation of the trust assets 
factoring out an approximate accounting adjustment in  this category of noninterest income increased by approximately in  followed by a increase in the increase in other service charges  commissions and fees  which totaled in over and in over primarily relates to revenue generated by annuity sales  alternative investment revenues and merchant credit card fees 
other income increased by in over  following an decrease in from this category of miscellaneous income is comprised of various revenue sources  both recurring and nonrecurring in nature 
the decrease in over was attributable to a gain recorded on the sale of student loans during totaling the increase in of  is primarily attributable to a gain on the sale of a building totalling  as well as atm revenues from surcharges assessed in and a general increase in fee schedules 
first midwest conducts its residential real estate mortgage loan origination  sales and servicing operations through fmmc 
mortgage banking revenues from these operations are a major component of noninterest income and include commissions and fees from third party loan servicing  realized gains on the sale of loans into the secondary market and origination and other fees received at closing 
prior to january   mortgage servicing rights were not capitalized and were recognized as income over the life of the asset 
in  as a result of favorable market conditions  first midwest sold approximately million in mortgage servicing rights originated prior to january  the gain on the sale of such previously uncapitalized mortgage servicing rights was  as of december   first midwest has remaining approximately  in loans serviced for which mortgage servicing rights are not capitalized

salaries and wages increased by in over such increase is comprised of general merit increases approximating in offset by reduced staffing primarily in the corporate administrative support division 
the lesser increase of in over is reflective of the continued benefits of the companywide restructuring which took place primarily during the second and third quarters of  the benefit of which was realized  in full  in and substantial temporary personnel expense was incurred during and to transition the staff reductions as well as to provide additional assistance required during the computer conversions incident to both the restructuring  the computer conversion which occurred in june  and the merger of citizens federal into the first midwest bank  national association in december the continuing emphasis on controlling health care benefit costs as well as reduced retirement costs due to lower levels of staffing in and was responsible for the decline in these two categories 
the increase in these categories in is attributable primarily to the higher levels of salaries and wages 
a discussion of first midwest s retirement benefits and the expenses related thereto is included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page occupancy expense increased by in over following a increase in over the increase reflects the operational costs of four additional branches established in last half of  and two additional branches opened in the third quarter of as well as rental increases on certain leased facilities 
the increase resulted primarily from the opening of a  square foot branch in champaign  illinois that began operations in june equipment expense increased by in as compared to  following a decrease in over the decrease in in this category resulted from general efficiencies realized through the restructuring as well as a reduction in the amount of replacement equipment needed due to lower support division staffing levels 
the increase in reflects higher equipment depreciation expense as a result of companywide computer hardware upgrades in and capitalized purchases of furniture and equipment for the additional branches established in and computer processing expense increased by in over and follows a 
increase in over in  computer processing expense remained level despite additional costs due to the merger of citizens federal 
much of the infrastructure necessary to accommodate companywide data processing was implemented in with the benefits being realized in the increase was due to a combination of the implementation of a wide area network during as well as costs incurred during the fourth quarter of attributable to the preparation for the conversion of the mchenry state bank computer systems which is scheduled to take place in february professional services decreased by in as compared to due primarily to reduced legal fees associated with the resolution of certain litigation 
the increase in is primarily due to legal and related transaction expenses in connection with the purchase of a  whole loan portfolio and the sale of mortgage servicing rights in the fourth quarter of fdic insurance decreased significantly in both and in  first midwest paid no fdic insurance assessments on its bif or saif assessment base 
in first midwest paid no fdic insurance assessment on its bif assessment base and insurance assessments on first midwest s saif assessment base for remained unchanged from at 
cents per of deposits until the fourth quarter of  at which time such assessment was also reduced to zero

capital management and dividends a strong capital structure is crucial in maintaining investor confidence  accessing capital markets and enabling first midwest to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities 
first midwest has developed a policy to manage its capital structure and that of its affiliates in accordance with regulatory guidelines and to ensure the appropriate use of this resource 
first midwest s capital policy requires that each affiliate maintain a capital ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines and also acts as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities  in addition to setting targeted levels of return on equity 
under capital adequacy guidelines  first midwest and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines  first midwest and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require first midwest and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital to average assets as defined 
first midwest believes that  as of december   first midwest and its banking subsidiaries meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject

securities which first midwest believes could be sold prior to maturity in order to manage interest rate  prepayment or liquidity risk are classified as securities available for sale and are carried at fair market value 
unrealized gains and losses on this portfolio segment are reported on an after tax basis as a separate component of stockholders equity 
securities which first midwest has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as securities held to maturity and are accounted for using historical cost  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount

this compares to an after tax net unrealized gain on such portfolio of as of the prior year end 
the unrealized net appreciation on this portfolio represents the difference  net of taxes  between the aggregate cost and market value of the portfolio

the maturity distributions of mortgaged backed securities in table are based upon the contractual maturities of such securities 
the mortgaged backed securities portfolio consists primarily of variable rate securities  including collateralized mortgage obligation bonds  as further discussed below 
actual maturities of the securities in table may differ from that reflected in the table due to securities with call features which are assumed to be held to contractual maturity for maturity distribution purposes 
mortgage backed securities in the above table having a market value of  include approximately  in collateralized mortgage obligation bonds cmos 
during  first midwest restructured its mortgage backed securities portfolio 
at year end virtually the entire mortgage backed securities portfolio had a maturity of over years 
in  first midwest sold most of its long term variable rate cmo s and reinvested the proceeds in a mixture of shorter term average life  high coupon defensive rate cmo s and longer term tax exempt securities 
while the coupon on the long term cmo s would have increased if interest rates rose  the price of those securities would have declined significantly in the same interest rate environment 
by contrast  the combination of defensive  high coupon cmo s and longer term tax exempt securities provides protection if interest rates rise due to the high coupons of the cmo s and also provides protection if rates decline due to the lack of callability of the longer term tax exempt securities

loan portfolio and credit quality portfolio composition loans represent the principal source of revenue to first midwest because  as a group  they are both the largest component and the highest yielding asset on the statement of condition 
the corollary to generating higher yields  however  is the assumption of the credit risk associated with the loan portfolio 
among the ways in which credit risk is controlled is through diversification of the loan portfolio and the limitation of the amount of loans extended to any one industry or group of borrowers 
over the past several years  first midwest has migrated toward a loan portfolio that it has attempted to distribute approximately evenly among the categories of commercial  consumer  and real estate  both residential and commercial 
this type of diversification spreads the risk and reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries 
it is first midwest s policy to concentrate its lending activity in the geographic market areas it serves  generally lending to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from whom deposits are gathered in the same market areas 
as a result  first midwest had no consequential out of market loans at december  first midwest does not engage in lending to foreign countries or foreign entities

additionally  during the fourth quarter of  a  loan portfolio was acquired consisting of prime quality automobile loans to customers in first midwest s primary market of metro chicago 
at the end of the first quarter of  first midwest sold approximately  in family real estate loans that had been underwritten on terms that did not permit them to be securitized 
commercial and industrial loans decreased by in this category of loans is diversified from an industry standpoint and includes loans extended to manufacturing  retailing and other service businesses 
consistent with first midwest s emphasis upon relationship banking  most of these credits represent core  multi relationship customers who also maintain deposit relationships and utilize other first midwest banking services such as cash management services 
consumer loans consist of loans made directly to individuals for various personal purposes as well as indirect installment loans represented mainly by automobile financings acquired from dealerships in first midwest s primary markets 
the following table summarizes consumer loans at december  and table consumer loans december  consumer loan type direct home equity loans   other direct installment loans 
  indirect installment loans   total   direct home equity loans increased as a result of the attractiveness of this form of lending due to the tax advantaged features  while other direct installment loans decreased in as compared to in the fourth quarter of  first midwest purchased  of prime whole automobile loans with an average life of years which are included in indirect installment loans 
the decrease in this category in was due to higher year end loans outstanding related to the fourth quarter whole loan purchase as well as tightened underwriting standards implemented during  as further discussed under the section entitled provision and reserve for loan losses located on page the consumer loan category includes no sub prime loans 
real estate family loans decreased by  or  in primarily due to the first quarter  loan sale  as well as accelerated paydowns that were experienced as a result of increased refinancings related to the general decline in mortgage loan rates during the second half of real estate family loans are comprised primarily of owner occupied residential properties 
real estate commercial loans  totaling  represent multi unit residential mortgages and commercial real estate mortgages  many housing the operations of the borrower s business 
the increase in commercial real estate loans in of  was due to higher loan demand from single tenant industrial customers and from office building and strip center loans  generally underwritten with maturities of five years or less 
in addition to the real estate family loans generated for its own portfolio  as reflected in table  first midwest also conducts a substantial residential real estate mortgage loan origination  sales and servicing operation through its mortgage banking subsidiary 
in first midwest originated in its primary markets approximately  in real estate family loans 
sales of such loans to the federal home loan mortgage corporation and other public and private investors totaled approximately  representing of such loans originated in this compares to s  in real estate family loans originated and  in sales into the secondary market 
first midwest s strategy has been to originate and retain in its portfolio adjustable rate mortgages while selling fixed rate mortgages to third party investors  retaining the servicing rights thereon 
this line of business  along with the attendant servicing operations  is further described in the noninterest income section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page real estate construction loans  which decreased by or  in  consist primarily of single family and multi family residential projects located in the primary market areas of first midwest s banking offices 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for first midwest due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the favorable loss experience on these loans 
first midwest closely monitors its extension of credit to customers in this loan category in order to limit its exposure to construction projects

the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in any given year is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge off levels  delinquencies  collateral values  and management s assessment of current and prospective economic conditions in first midwest s primary market areas 
the provision for loan losses of  includes  representing a one time provision to conform mchenry state bank s credit policies to first midwest s incident to mchenry s acquisition in the fourth quarter of similarly  of the provision for loan losses related to conforming citizens federal s credit policies to first midwest s 
the reserve for loan losses is maintained at a level which is considered adequate in relation to the risk of future losses within the loan portfolio and is comprised of allocations for specific impaired loans  allocations for categories of loans and unallocated reserves 
the portion of the reserve applicable to impaired loans is discussed in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page the allocation for categories of loans represents management s judgment as to potential loss exposure based on both actual loan losses experienced by loan category over the preceding three years as well as the results of loan ratings and credit reviews performed

as is shown in table  consumer loan charge offs have increased in each of the last three years  with such loans generally being charged off after a loan has been delinquent for days or more 
the increase in consumer loan charge offs can be attributed to the generally higher levels of consumer debt and declarations of consumer bankruptcy that have been experienced over the last few years 
during  in light of the higher level of charge offs  first midwest tightened its consumer loan underwriting standards and such action was  in part  the reason for the decrease in consumer loans outstanding at year end as compared to table details this comparison 
nonperforming loans and assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and real estate owned 
past due loans are loans which are delinquent days or more and are still accruing interest 
it is first midwest s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan when there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collectability of interest or principal 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer doubt as to such collectability

in addition to the loans summarized in table  the securities and exchange commission industry guide requires that certain other loans in the portfolio which first midwest is monitoring  but where existing conditions do not warrant classification as nonaccrual or restructured  be disclosed 
these loans  which totaled  at december   as compared to  at year end  continue to accrue interest and are specifically considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
first midwest s discussion of impaired loans is contained in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on pages and  respectively 
impact of year first midwest is currently in the process of addressing a potential problem that is facing all users of automated information systems  including personal computers  that is generally referred to as the year issue 
the problem is the result of computer systems processing transactions based upon digits representing the year of the transaction rather than full digits ie  for 
these computer systems may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  in some cases  this could result in a system failure  miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the problem could effect a wide variety of automated information systems such as main frame computer applications  personal computers  communications systems  including telephone systems  and other information systems utilized by not only first midwest but also its vendors and customers 
the most significant of first midwest s automated information systems affected by the year issue are the data processing systems used to process transactions and information for loan  deposit and trust customers 
first midwest currently purchases the services for these systems from three nationally recognized data processing vendors 
other programs applications used in first midwest s operations that will be effected by the year issue include building and security systems  equipment such as proof machines  sorters  cash dispensers  hardware such as routers  servers  printers  controllers and atm modems and computer software 
the majority of these items have been purchased from outside vendors who are responsible for maintenance of the systems and modifications to enable uninterrupted usage 
additionally  first midwest does have some in house applications  interface equipment and interfaces that must be reviewed and modified 
in april  first midwest began the process of developing a plan and identifying internal resources to address the year issue 
the plan includes the identification of the extent of the problem by performing an inventory of all potentially affected software  hardware  other equipment and systems and initiating formal communications with all of first midwest s significant suppliers and vendors to obtain certification of year compliance and the testing of all impacted applications both third party provided and internally developed 
first midwest s goals are to be fully compliant by november and to conduct testing of all programs applications during the period january through october first midwest s plan to become year compliant is being executed with internal resources  primarily through its information systems staff 
additionally  first midwest expects to utilize contract consulting to supplement its internal staff  as needed 
other costs to become compliant will include updating and or replacement of software and hardware  the cost of which will be capitalized and depreciated 
the payroll and payroll related costs and consulting expenses for internal and external human resources will be expensed as incurred 
based on currently available information  first midwest does not anticipate that the cost to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity
