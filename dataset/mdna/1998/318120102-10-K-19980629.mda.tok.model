item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is the leading worldwide producer of interactive simulation systems designed to provide training in the handling and use of small and supporting arms 
as a result of the simtran acquisition  the company also has a contract to develop air defense and armored vehicle products 
the company has focused its sales efforts primarily in the us and international military and law enforcement market and more recently has begun to sell simulation training systems in the hunter and sports training component of the market 
the company derives most of its revenues from the sale of its products  which include simulators  simulated firearms  scenarios  software and auxiliary equipment  and certain additional revenues from service operations 
the company receives purchase commitments for its products and services from its customers largely through purchase orders and short and long term contracts principally with governmental entities 
sales revenues are recognized primarily upon shipment with advanced billings related to contracts recorded as deferred revenue and recognized primarily as units are delivered or on a percentage of completion method for a contract in which completion and delivery exceeds one year 
service revenues are comprised of revenues from individual purchase orders  which are recognized as services are provided  and revenues from extended service contracts  which are recognized over the life of the service contracts 
although the company sells its products and services to a large number of military and law enforcement agencies in the us and internationally  the top five customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
a significant increase or decrease in demand by a large customer can have a substantial effect on the company s revenues  and revenues from any one customer can vary materially from period to period 
in addition  although the company has experienced an increased demand for its products in recent years despite decreases in general levels of defense spending  a significant decrease in the overall level or allocation of defense spending in the us or other countries could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s sales are also made to customers located outside the us  primarily in europe and asia 
during fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from sales to international customers 
the company expects that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of future revenues  as the worldwide acceptance for simulation based training systems continues to grow and us military opportunities are reduced 
sales to international customers may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations and changes in import export regulations and tariff rates or imposition of economic sanctions such as those recently applied to india and pakistan 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been and in the future may be proposed in the us and certain other countries 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect the company s sales to international customers 
certain of the company s international sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company does not currently hedge these foreign currency transactions  since it believes its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been material 
cost of revenues generally includes materials  direct labor  overhead and other direct costs 
operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses and depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  wages  benefits  international agents commissions and marketing expenses 
r d expenses are largely comprised of salaries  wages  benefits  prototype equipment and project supplies 
the company expenses all r d costs in the period in which they are incurred and has funded all of its r d efforts over the past years primarily through internally generated funds 
us marine corps contract in august  through competitive bidding  the company was awarded a fixed price contract contract with the us marine corps for the supply of small and supporting arms simulators 
this contract also contains provisions which have enabled purchases under the contract of firearms simulators by the us army 
the total initial contract amount was million  and options exercised and contract modifications made have increased that amount by a total of million through march  deliveries under contract commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and totaled million through march  us army est procurement process the company has been actively participating in a competitive bidding process for the proposed us army engagement skills trainer est program  a us military procurement award anticipated to be at least as large as the company s current us marine corps contract on may   the company received notification on behalf of the us army that its proposal in response to the ongoing competition had been excluded from further consideration 
on june   the company filed an action in the united states court of federal claims to protest this decision  and to obtain an injunction against any award of the est contract until the court can rule on the company s protest 
as part of this action  the company has requested that the court order the procurement authority to continue its consideration of the company s proposal and to engage in meaningful discussions with the company 
although the company intends to pursue this matter vigorously  there can be no assurance that the court will grant the relief requested 
furthermore  even if the company is successful in securing the right to continue in the competitive bidding process  there can be no assurance that the company would ultimately be successful in securing the est contract award 
in view of the company s substantial completion of marine corps contract and the more limited scope of other us military opportunities  the failure to secure an award of the us army est contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenues from the us military  particularly as compared with the us military revenues in fiscal  and the company s financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
to support the company s objectives of increasing revenues  the company had developed its infrastructure during the last several years in expectation that the resulting increase in expense would be offset by additional revenues 
in response to developments concerning the army est procurement process and possible related impact on related business opportunities  the company announced on june  that it would take a restructuring charge of approximately  for costs incurred in the first quarter fiscal related to a workforce reduction and other measures 
in addition  the company has agreed to a revision of certain financial covenants under its senior credit facility which will result in incurrence of certain additional interest costs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
backlog backlog represents customer orders that have been contracted for future delivery 
accordingly  these orders have not yet been recognized as revenue  but represent potential revenue 
as of march   the company had a backlog of approximately million  comprised of million from fats international customers  from simtran s canadian customers and million from fats us military customers 
recognition of simtran s backlog will be dependent upon delivery and acceptance of its products currently under development 
approximately million of the contracted orders are scheduled for delivery during fiscal year contracts with us and other governments may generally be terminated by the customer  in whole or in part  for default or its convenience if such termination would be in the best interest of the customer 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s backlog will result in future revenues 
however  these contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred through the date of termination

extraordinary loss a portion of the proceeds from the offering was used to repay the million bridge notes and reduce the senior bank debt by million 
as a result  an extraordinary loss occurred on the early extinguishment of debt 
this extraordinary item includes legal fees  unamortized deferred financing costs  unamortized basis of the nationsbridge warrants and a fee paid in connection with the repayment of the bridge notes 
acquired in process research and development charge the company recognized a non recurring acquired in process research and development charge in connection with the acquisition of simtran completed on march  based on an assessment by the company  in conjunction with an independent valuation firm  it was determined that million or per diluted share of simtran s purchase price represented technology that does not meet the accounting definition of completed technology  and thus should be charged to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles 
growth strategy the company has experienced significant growth in its sales during recent years  primarily  due to sales to the us marine corps  and intends to seek further growth through expanded sales of its existing products in its target markets as well as the development of new products and markets and through strategic acquisitions 
see us army est procurement process above 
the company s growth strategy includes the following core elements increase market penetration 
the company is seeking to broaden acceptance of its products and increase sales to military and law enforcement agencies internationally and in the us while continuing to acquire new customers by demonstrating the cost effectiveness and training benefits of its products  the company also focuses on generating repeat orders from existing customers 
the company has found that its customers often order additional simulation systems after an initial purchase once they experience the advantages of the fats r systems 
in addition  in recent years  the company has begun to focus on generating follow on orders through systems upgrades  software and other auxiliary products 
continue new product development 
a key element of the company s growth strategy is new product development 
the company believes that it can continue to develop new products as a result of its r d efforts and its understanding of the needs of its customers 
addition of an indirect fire simulator for artillery and naval gunfire has resulted in the award of an additional contract with the canadian armed forces beyond small arms simulators and may assist the company in gaining additional new contracts 
the company is also developing simulators for newly emerging weaponry and products integrating fats r systems with larger weapons system simulators  such as those currently being developed by simtran 
in addition  the company is currently developing simulation products for training law enforcement personnel in the use of less than lethal force eg  tear gas  batons  sticky foam and bean bag shotguns 
expand into new markets 
management believes that opportunities exist for sales beyond the company s traditional military and law enforcement customers 
the company had already begun to focus on the hunter and sports training component of the market  and with the acquisition of dart seeks to increase the penetration in this business 
the company believes that potential customers for products related to hunter education include both state and federal agencies which have shown interest in simulation as a means of promoting hunter safety and conservation as well as firearms dealers interested in the use of simulators for competitive shooting exercises  hunter training and home security programs 
pursue selected strategic acquisitions 
as an alternative or a supplement to the internal development of additional product lines  new products could be developed or added to the fats r line by means of strategic acquisitions  joint ventures or partnerships 
in particular  an acquisition of a company with a strong brand name in lower price point or different products could permit the company to expand its product line  while maintaining the premium position of the fats r brand name such as the recent acquisitions of icat  simtran and dart completed within the last twelve months

among the factors causing these variations have been the number  timing and scope of the company s contracts and purchase orders  concentration of shipments under large orders and the uneven timing of the receipt by the company of necessary authorizations from government customers 
the company recognizes revenues primarily upon shipment of its products to its customers  while a high percentage of the company s operating expenses  including personnel  rent and debt service  are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result the concentration of several order deliveries in a particular quarter  unanticipated variations in the number and timing of shipments or customer delays in proceeding to succeeding stages of a contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s quarterly results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity and capital resources needs currently and for the near future are to fund working capital  debt service and capital expenditures necessary to support its business 
prior to the recapitalization  the company s principal liquidity and capital resource needs were to fund working capital and capital expenditures related to growth 
the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operating activities and the senior bank debt 
as of june  the company amended the nationsbank credit agreement to provide for an increase in interest rates and for a temporary relaxation of certain restrictive financial covenants 
these covenant changes were based on the company s current business outlook which assumes receipt and delivery of orders from new and existing customers and delivery of the million of the million in backlog as of march  however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet these covenants and that further senior bank debt borrowings will be available should it fail to do so 
the company currently has borrowings of million and has outstanding letters of credit of approximately million under the million revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations combined with borrowings under the senior bank debt  will be sufficient to meet the company s presently anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs for at least the next months 
the company entered into the senior bank debt and borrowed an aggregate of million in connection with the recapitalization 
see business history 
the senior bank debt provided for credit facilities in an aggregate amount of million  consisting of i a million revolving credit line  ii a tranche a term loan facility with an initial amount of million  and iii a tranche b term loan facility with an initial amount of million 
the company used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to reduce the borrowings under the senior bank debt and as of october  amended the credit facility to provide an additional million under the revolving credit line 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of and after giving effect to the application of the net proceeds of the offering to reduce the borrowed amount  the quarterly principal payments in respect to tranche a term loan facility and the tranche b term loan facility commenced on december   from december  through june   the aggregate amount of such scheduled principal payments is approximately million per quarter and from september  through march   the aggregate amount of such scheduled principal payments will be approximately million per quarter 
in addition  the company will be required to make quarterly interest payments on such indebtedness 
the revolving credit line  the tranche a term loan facility and the tranche b term loan facility bear interest at variable rates  which were approximately  and  respectively  at march  the amendment entered into as of june  provides for an additional increase to the interest rates to the revolving credit line  the tranche a term loan facility and the tranche b term loan facility of  and  respectively 
the senior bank debt is guaranteed by the company and is secured by a pledge of all of the stock of the drop down subsidiary and a security interest in the assets of the drop down subsidiary 
the company s indebtedness and the related covenants will have several important effects on the future operations  including but not limited to  the following i a portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on and principal of its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  r d  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be limited  and iii the company s level of indebtedness could limit its flexibility in reacting to business developments and changes in its industry and economic conditions generally 
the company s operating activities generated cash of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  due to net income in those periods 
the cash generated from operations was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories in fiscal and the company s investing activities used cash of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s use of cash for investing activities in was due to payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the company s use of cash for investing activities in and was due to capital expenditures 
in fiscal  the company generated cash of million in financing activities  primarily in connection with the borrowings of long term debt to finance its acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements year in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income  sfas 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year ending march  management does not expect sfas to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
also in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas requires companies to determine reporting segments based on the manner in which management makes decisions about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance 
disclosures for each segment are similar to those required under current standards  with the addition of certain quarterly disclosure requirements 
sfas also requires entity wide disclosure about the products and services an entity provides  the countries in which it holds material assets and reports material revenues  and its significant customers 
sfas is effective for financial statements for the company s fiscal year ending march  the company does not expect that sfas will require significant revision of prior disclosures 
the company expects to incur certain costs during the next two years to address the impact of the year problem on its information systems 
the year problem  which is common to most businesses  concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information on and beyond january  the company currently believes that it will be able to modify or replace its affected systems in time to minimize any detrimental effects on operations 
the company s products currently delivered to customers are designed to be year compliant 
previously delivered customer products have minor issues relating to computer printouts 
these issues are corrected in all new releases of software that are purchased by customers 
the incremental costs of the year project are estimated between  and  these costs will be expensed as incurred  unless new software is purchased that will be capitalized in accordance with the company s policy 
the company does not expect that the year problem will have a material impact on the results of operations  liquidity or consolidated financial position of the company
