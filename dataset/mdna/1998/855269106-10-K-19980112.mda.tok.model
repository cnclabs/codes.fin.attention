the company s average sale per unit was  in on  sale units versus  in on  sale units 
the domestic conversion market continues to decline due to the increased popularity and availability of sport utility vehicles and factory minivans  price pressure from higher chassis costs and lower levels of conversion inventory being held on dealer retail lots 
the company s domestic sale units declined versus an industry average of as reported by the recreational vehicle industry association 
international sales in benefited from the early build of model year minivans for japan totaling million 
gross profit gross profit decreased from million of sales in to million of sales in the decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales is attributable to the impact of fixed plant overhead costs on the lower sales volume and million of incremental carrying costs on chassis consignment inventory 
selling and promotion expense selling and promotion expense decreased million to million in from due to the lower domestic sales volume 
this expense increased from of sales to of sales due to the impact of fixed salesmen salaries on the lower sales volume 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased in relative to before the impact of the national mobility acquisition after national mobility 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in personnel 
restructuring charges in december the company completed the consolidation of its imperial automotive group manufacturing operation into starcraft automotive group s manufacturing complex in goshen  indiana

the company recorded a  restructure charge in the first quarter of fiscal year  which remains reasonable at year end 
the company estimates it will realize annual overhead expense reductions of approximately million from reduced facility and personnel costs during relative to in june the company closed its mcgregor  texas manufacturing facility and sold certain assets of the business 
the company recorded a  net restructure charge in the third quarter of fiscal year primarily for the write down of leasehold improvements 
the company should realize savings from the closure of the texas facility which lost million pretax in the restructuring charges consisted of employee termination and other costs  leasehold asset write offs  and the recognition of remaining contractual lease obligations 
goodwill impairment loss operating losses at imperial  together with a strategic review of the conversion industry  resulted in an evaluation of the goodwill related to the acquisition of imperial industries  inc the july acquisition of imperial industries  inc was viewed at that time as a strategic expansion of the company s production capacity  conversion products lines  and sales and dealer network 
the operating strategy was to allow imperial to remain an independent manufacturing and operating subsidiary focused exclusively on the price sensitive  entry level domestic market 
however  subsequent to the acquisition  the domestic market has contracted  gross margins have deteriorated  and imperial has experienced operating losses 
in  the manufacturing operations of imperial were consolidated into the starcraft manufacturing facility to reduce excess capacity 
further integration of the manufacturing operations  as well as integration and reduction of the sales  dealer and general and administration functions  have occurred since this consolidation 
as a result of the change in the domestic market  abandonment of the original strategic operating plan for imperial  cumulative operating losses and continued weakness in the domestic vehicle conversion market  an impairment loss of million  increased from the estimate of million previously announced  was recorded in the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining goodwill associated with this acquisition 
income taxes the income tax credit was recorded at a effective rate primarily due to the impact of a million valuation allowance for deferred income taxes

unit sales decreased to  in domestic sales were hampered early in the year by the availability of general motors products  primarily attributable to the oem strike  production issues on the minivan and the delayed introduction of the newly redesigned fullsize van 
as the company historically relies heavily on general motors products  the company s unit van shipments declined in compared to the industry s decline of as reported by the recreational vehicle industry association 
van conversion sales for were negatively impacted by the growing popularity of oem sport utility vehicles suvs 
the company s shipments of converted pickup trucks and suvs increased in international sales in benefited from the early build of model minivans for japan totaling million 
the average conversion price declined in due to a change in product sales mix toward pickup trucks and suvs and the percentage increase of imperial and lonestar units which compete primarily in the entry level price range

the effective rate in benefited from the implementation of a foreign sales corporation subsidiary 
seasonality and trends the company s sales and profits are dependent on the automotive markets in the united states and overseas  primarily japan and northern europe  and the oem s ability to supply vehicle chassis 
the business tends to be seasonal with stronger sales in march through july and is influenced by a number of factors including atypical weather for any sales region and oem programs affecting the price  supply and delivery of vehicle chassis 
general motors chassis represented of the company s total unit shipments in compared to in the company s retail dealers had approximately  units on hand at the end of compared to  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of conversion inventory on dealer retail lots is down for the entire industry relative to prior years 
the company believes dealers are stocking fewer conversion products because of the growing availability of additional vehicle models such as sport utility vehicles and a general concern by dealers of the future of the conversion industry 
the oems have recently increased their advertising and dealer training efforts to support vehicle conversion product 
the strengthened us dollar and recent turmoil in financial markets in asia will pressure the company s export sales and margins 
however  new market penetration and continued development of existing markets  especially europe  should partially offset the asia market decline 
the domestic conversion market is expected to continue to decline in the company eliminated much excess production capacity and reduced overhead in to address the decline in revenue 
in the company began a plan to diversify both its product base and target markets as it acquired national mobility corporation 
national mobility markets its products in both the retail and government markets 
in the company expects to continue to pursue its cost reduction and diversification strategy

the company has reviewed its information systems for compatability with year it has plans in place to replace software deemed incompatable with year in a timely manner and does not anticipate any material adverse effect from year compatability issues 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities used cash of million during compared to providing cash of million in the prior year 
the use of cash resulted primarily from the pretax operating loss 
the company expects to receive million in federal and state tax refunds in december or january receivables decreased million and accounts payable decreased million due to the decrease in sales and production levels 
inventories declined million due to the reduced production levels and the company s inventory reduction efforts 
the company invested million in property and equipment during the year primarily for product tooling  information systems  building upgrades  and plant equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures to be significantly less than levels 
the company acquired national mobility corporation of elkhart  indiana in february for million in cash  assumption of certain bank debt  and  shares of the company s common stock 
national mobility is one of the largest manufacturers of conversion vehicles for the physically challenged with annual sales for fiscal of million 
the company s use of cash for operations and investing activities was financed by bank debt 
at the end of september  bank debt was million 
on january   the company entered into an amended credit agreement with its bank which was effective as of december  the agreement has a maturity date of january  borrowings are limited to specified percentages of eligible receivables  inventories  and property and equipment and are subject to maximum limits of million through march   million from march  through june   and million thereafter

if these minimum levels are not maintained  any outstanding balances become payable upon demand of the bank 
the company s tangible net worth was million at september  in order to maintain the minimum levels of tangible net worth through  the company needs to achieve operating results substantially consistent with its operating plan 
this plan calls for net sales to be approximately six percent less than net sales 
this reduction results primarily from reduced sales in the core conversion business partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of national mobility corporation s sales in the company plans to reduce cost of goods sold through improved plant operating efficiencies  a new pay system for production line associates  and the reduction of carrying costs of its chassis by decreasing inventory levels 
in addition  the company plans to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses 
in december the company reorganized its sales department and adopted a more focused advertising plan to reduce selling and promotion costs 
general and administrative costs will be reduced primarily through reductions in personnel and the decrease in certain employee benefits in in addition to the availability of bank financing  the company has restricted sales agreements with general motors acceptance corporation  chrysler financial corporation and ford motor credit company 
pursuant to these agreements  the company obtains vehicle chassis from the oem s for days at nominal rates 
if the company fails to match a chassis with a dealer order within days after delivery of the chassis to the company  carrying charges increase to prime rate plus 
in the board of director s approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  of which  shares have been acquired to date 
no shares were repurchased in additional shares are not expected to be acquired until the company s debt is reduced

from time to time  starcraft may make oral or written forward looking statements regarding its anticipated sales  costs  expenses  earnings and matters affecting its condition and operations 
all such forward looking statements are subject to a number of material factors which could cause the statements or projections contained therein to be materially inaccurate 
such factors include  without limitation  the following general operating contingencies 
the company may not be able to attract and retain employees with sufficient skills to conduct its operations efficiently and may from time to time be subject to work slow downs or stoppages 
the company may be adversely affected by delay or unavailability of supply of numerous component parts 
the company will not always be able to satisfy its capital requirements with internally generated funds and may  from time to time  need to rely on bank financing and other third party capital resources 
there is no assurance that such resources will always be available to the company or as to the terms that will apply to any financing 
acquisitions 
the company may be engaged in negotiations from time to time regarding prospective acquisitions of van conversion or related businesses 
such acquisitions could be material to the company and  if effected  could have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there is no assurance as to when or whether the company will be able to effect acquisitions  whether it will be able to generate requisite funding to effect such acquisitions  or as to the terms on which such acquisitions may be effected 
economic conditions 
the van conversion industry is cyclical and is affected by the general trends of the economy and consumer preferences and consumer confidence and trends of the automotive and recreational vehicle industries both domestically and in international markets 
the level of disposable consumer income affects the company s sales because its products are generally considered discretionary expenditures by consumers 
in difficult economic times  consumers tend to spend less of their income on discretionary items 
other economic factors affecting the demand for the company s products include the availability and price of gasoline  the level of interest rates and the availability of consumer financing 
a decline in general economic conditions or consumer confidence can be expected to affect starcraft s sales adversely 
supply and financing of vehicle chassis 
the company is dependent upon the oems to supply its requirements for vehicle chassis 
labor stoppages  supply shortages and a variety of other factors that influence oem production can affect the availability or timely delivery of vehicle chassis to the company 
if vehicle chassis are unavailable  or if the company must accept delivery earlier or later than it otherwise would prefer  sales could be adversely affected and financing expenses could increase 
the company must also comply with its consignment and restricted sale contracts with the oems pursuant to which the oems impose certain specifications for the company s vehicle conversions  including gross vehicle weight standards 
such contracts also restrict the company s ability to dispose of completed chassis and prohibit the transfer of chassis to unauthorized us and foreign dealers 
all of the company s consignment and restricted sale contracts with chassis suppliers are terminable by either party on short notice without cause 
the availability of the oem financing rates is dependent upon the company s compliance with its oem contracts and its ability to maintain satisfactory credit relationships with the oem s finance subsidiaries 
adverse changes in the company s financial condition or results of operations could cause such financing subsidiaries to seek to change adversely the company s financing terms or to terminate such financing arrangements 
such a change or termination could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
regulation 
the company is subject to various foreign  federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  van conversion components produced by the company are required to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards and similar safety standards imposed in its foreign markets 
promulgation of additional safety standards in the future could require the company to incur additional testing and engineering expenses which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s international sales can be adversely affected by changes in foreign import tariffs and taxes and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company must comply with certain federal and state regulations relating to the disposition of hazardous wastes generated in its production processes 
the company s failure to comply with applicable regulations or changes in current regulations  including the adoption of new safety or environmental standards  could have material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition 
the united states van conversion industry is very competitive with several principal nationwide manufacturers and numerous local and regional competitors 
there is no assurance the company will be able to maintain its current competitive position in the van conversion market 
potential product liability 
like other automotive manufacturers  the company may be subject to claims that its products caused or contributed to damage or injury sustained in vehicle accidents or may be required to recall products deemed unsafe 
any such claims in excess of the company s insurance coverage or material product recall expenses could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations
