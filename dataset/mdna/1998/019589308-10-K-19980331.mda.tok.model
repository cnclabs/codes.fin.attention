item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
introduction the company has experienced significant growth  a substantial portion of which has resulted from the acquisition of solid waste businesses 
since january   the company has completed over acquisitions including the laidlaw acquisition in in  the company acquired businesses and subsequent to it has acquired businesses 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the acquisition of companies accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
the majority of the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method for business combinations and  accordingly  the results of operations for such acquired businesses are included in the company s financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  the company believes its historical results of operations for the periods presented are not directly comparable 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the non hazardous solid waste management business conducted by laidlaw in the united states and canada  for total consideration of approximately billion comprised of billion cash  million shares of common stock  warrants to acquire million shares of common stock the warrant  and two junior subordinated debentures with an aggregate face amount of million

the net proceeds of million related to the million face value senior discount notes the senior discount notes were used to fund the repurchase 
also pursuant to the laidlaw securities purchase agreement  the private securities investment funds purchased all of the common stock of allied held by laidlaw

also pursuant to this transaction  the company sold to usa waste six landfills  seventeen collection operations  three transfer stations and four recycling facilities with an aggregate of approximately million in annual revenue for which it received consideration of approximately million 
in november  the company assumed ownership and operation of the active solid waste disposal system for san diego county  california 
allied acquired operations of four landfills  one transfer station  and one material recovery facility for approximately million in cash paid directly to san diego county 
in december  the company acquired the ecdc landfill from laidaw environmental services  inc for approximately million in cash  notes  assumed debt and a contingent payable 
general revenues 
the company s revenues are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
the company s collection services are generally provided under direct agreements with its customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms  where used  generally range from to years and commonly have automatic renewal options 
the company s landfill operations include both company owned landfills and those operated for municipalities for a fee 
the company is fully integrated in each geographic region in which it is located as it provides collection  transfer and disposal services 
the tables below show for the periods indicated the percentage of the company s total reported revenues attributable to services provided and to geographic region year ended december  collection transfer landfill other total revenues year ended december  great lakes midwest northeast southeast southwest west total revenues the portion of collection revenues attributable to disposal charges for waste collected by the company and disposed at the company s landfills have been excluded from collection revenues and included in landfill revenues 
the company s strategy is to develop vertically integrated operations to ensure internalization of the waste it collects and thus realize higher margins from its operations 
by disposing of waste at company owned and or operated landfills  the company retains the margin generated through disposal operations that would otherwise be earned by third party landfills 
approximately of company collected waste is disposed of at company owned and or operated landfills as measured using disposal volumes in in addition  transfer stations are an integral part of the disposal process 
the company locates its transfer stations in areas where its landfills are outside of the population centers in which it collects waste 
such waste is transferred to long haul trailers and economically transported to its landfills 
expenses 
cost of operations includes labor  maintenance and repairs  equipment and facility rent  utilities and taxes  the costs of ongoing environmental compliance  safety and insurance  disposal costs and costs of independent haulers transporting company waste to the disposal site 
disposal costs include certain landfill taxes  host community fees  payments under agreements with respect to landfill sites that are not owned  landfill site maintenance  fuel and other equipment operating expenses and accruals for estimated closure and post closure monitoring expenses anticipated to be incurred in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  sales costs  community relations expenses and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable and potentially unrealizable acquisition costs 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of landfill development costs including capitalized interest  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with potential acquisitions  the company incurs and capitalizes certain transaction and integration costs which include stock registration  legal  accounting  consulting  engineering and other direct costs 
when an acquisition is completed and is accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations  these costs are charged to the statement of operations as acquisition related costs 
when a completed acquisition is accounted for using the purchase method for business combinations  these costs are capitalized 
the company routinely evaluates capitalized transaction and integration costs and expenses those costs related to acquisitions not likely to occur 
indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  upgrading  construction and permitting costs  are capitalized and amortized based on consumed airspace 
the company believes that the costs associated with engineering  owning and operating landfills will increase in the future as a result of federal  state and local regulation and a growing community awareness of the landfill permitting process 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that it will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset these increased expenses 
all indirect landfill development costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
accrued closure and post closure costs represent an estimate of the current value of the future obligation associated with closure and post closure monitoring of non hazardous solid waste landfills currently owned and or operated by the company 
site specific closure and post closure engineering cost estimates are prepared annually for landfills owned and or operated by the company for which it is responsible for closure and post closure 
the present value of estimated future costs are accrued based on accepted tonnage as landfill airspace is consumed 
discounting of future costs is applied where the company believes that both the amounts and timing of related payments are reliably determinable 
the company periodically updates its estimates of future closure and post closure costs 
the impact of changes which are determined to be changes in estimates are accounted for on a prospective basis 
the net present value of the closure and post closure commitment is calculated assuming inflation of and a risk free capital rate of 
discounted amounts previously recorded and not yet expended are accreted to reflect the effects of the passage of time 
the company s current estimate of total future payments for closure and post closure is billion while the present value of such estimate is million 
at december  and  accruals for landfill closure and post closure costs including costs assumed through acquisitions were approximately million and million  respectively 
the accruals reflect relatively young landfills with estimated remaining lives  based on current waste flows  that range from to over years  and an estimated average remaining life of greater than years 
year systems modifications 
during  allied began modifying its computer system programming to process transactions in the year anticipated spending for this modification will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s ongoing results of operations

as of december  there is aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility of approximately million to be used for working capital  letters of credit  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
in october  the company amended the credit agreement the amendment 
the amendment expanded the credit agreement to billion from million by increasing the revolving credit facility from million to million and by adding a million delayed draw term facility the delayed draw term facility  after giving effect to the repayment of million of the term loan facility on september  the revolving credit facility includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit increased from million at september  
the indentures relating to the notes  the senior discount notes and the credit agreement contain financial and operating covenants and restrictions on the ability of the company to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
a substantial portion of the company s available cash will be required to be applied to service indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred to finance the laidlaw acquisition 
currently  on an annualized basis  this is expected to include approximately million in annual principal and interest payments 
the company is also required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to its landfill operations and collection contracts 
these financial assurance requirements are satisfied by the company issuing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits to secure the company s obligations as they relate to landfill closure and post closure costs and performance under certain collection contracts 
at december   the company had outstanding approximately million in financial assurance instruments  represented by million of performance bonds  million of letters of credit  million of insurance policies and million of trust deposits 
during calendar year  the company expects to be required to provide approximately million in financial assurance obligations relating to its landfill operations and collection contracts 
the company expects that financial assurance obligations will increase in the future as it acquires and expands its landfill activities and that a greater percentage of the financial assurance instruments will be comprised of performance bonds and insurance policies

subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous waste disposal industry have required the company  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate the company to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase the company s operating costs and impair the company s ability to invest in its facilities 
the company s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements  to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest  or to refinance its indebtedness  and to fund capital amounts required for the acquisition of businesses and the expansion of existing businesses depends on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  management of the company believes that available cash flow  together with available borrowing under the senior credit facility  the lease facilities and other sources of liquidity  will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated future requirements for working capital  letters of credit  capital expenditures  scheduled payments of principal and interest on debt incurred under the credit agreement  interest on the notes and the senior discount notes  and capital amounts required for acquisitions and expansion 
however  the principal payment at maturity on the notes and the senior discount notes may require refinancing 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing would be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
additionally  depending on the timing  amount and structure of any future acquisitions and the availability of funds under the credit agreement  the company may need to raise additional capital to fund the acquisition and integration of additional solid waste businesses 
the company may raise such funds through additional bank financings or public or private offerings of its debt and equity securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure such funding  if necessary  on favorable terms  if at all 
if the company is not successful in securing such funding  the company s ability to pursue its business strategy may be impaired and results of operations for future periods may be negatively affected

all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  number of acquisitions and projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions made by or to be made by the company  or projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings  levels of capital expenditures or other aspects of operating results 
all phases of the company operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside the control of the company and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of the company s operations and whether forward looking statements made by the company ultimately prove to be accurate 
such important factors important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are disclosed in this section and elsewhere in this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the important factors described below that could cause actual results to differ from the company s expectations 
competition 
the solid waste collection and disposal business is highly competitive and requires substantial amounts of capital 
the company competes with numerous waste management companies  a number of which have significantly larger operations and greater resources than the company 
the company also competes with those counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 
forward looking statements assume that the company will be able to effectively compete with the other waste management companies and municipalities 
availability of acquisition targets 
the company s ongoing acquisition program is a key element of its expansion strategy 
in addition  obtaining landfill permits has become increasingly difficult  time consuming and expensive 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in obtaining landfill permits or locating appropriate acquisition candidates that can be acquired at price levels that the company considers appropriate and that reflects historical prices 
the forward looking statements assume that a number of acquisition candidates and landfill properties sufficient to meet the company s goals will be available for purchase and that the company will be able to complete the acquisition at prices that the company has experienced in the past two years 
integration 
the company s financial position and results of operations depend to a large extent on the integration of recently acquired businesses 
the forward looking statements assume that integration of acquired companies  including the internalization of waste  will require from three to nine months from the date the acquisition closes 
failure to achieve effective integration in the anticipated time period or at all could have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
ongoing capital requirements 
to the extent that internally generated cash and cash available under the company s existing credit facilities are not sufficient to provide the cash required for future operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt repayment obligations and or financial assurance obligations  the company will require additional equity and or debt financing in order to provide such cash 
the company has incurred significant debt obligations in the last two years  which entail substantial debt service costs 
the forward looking statements assume that the company will be able to raise the capital necessary to finance such requirements at rates that are as good as or better than those it is currently experiencing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such financing will be available or  if available  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
economic conditions 
the company s business is affected by general economic conditions 
the forward looking statements assume that the company will be able to achieve internal volume and price growth which is not impacted by an economic downturn 
as revenue of the company continues to grow it is likely that the rates of internal growth will reflect growth rates which are less than those experienced in there can be no assurance that an economic downturn will not result in a reduction in the volume of waste being disposed of at the company s operations and or the price that the company can charge for its services 
weather conditions 
protracted periods of inclement weather may adversely affect the company s operations by interfering with collection and landfill operations  delaying the development of landfill capacity and or reducing the volume of waste generated by the company s customers 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of the company s operations 
the forward looking statements do not assume that such weather conditions will occur 
dependence on senior management 
the company is highly dependent upon its senior management team 
in addition  as the company continues to grow  its requirements for operations management with waste industry experience will also increase 
the availability of such experienced management is not known 
the forward looking statements assume that experienced management will be available when needed by the company at compensation levels that are within industry norms 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management could have a material adverse effect on the company 
influence of government regulation 
the company s operations are subject to and substantially affected by extensive federal  state and local laws  regulations  orders and permits  which govern environmental protection  health and safety  zoning and other matters 
these regulations may impose restrictions on operations that could adversely affect the company s results  such as limitations on the expansion of disposal facilities  limitations on or the banning of disposal of out of state waste or certain categories of waste or mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste 
because of heightened public concern  companies in the waste management business may become subject to judicial and administrative proceedings involving federal  state or local agencies 
these governmental agencies may seek to impose fines or to revoke or deny renewal of operating permits or licenses for violations of environmental laws or regulations or to require remediation of environmental problems at sites or nearby properties  or resulting from transportation or predecessors transportation and collection operations  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
liability may also arise from actions brought by individuals or community groups in connection with the permitting or licensing of operations  any alleged violations of such permits and licenses or other matters 
the forward looking statements assume that there will be no materially negative impact on the company s operations due to government regulation 
potential environmental liability 
the company may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of its operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company 
due to the limited nature of the company s insurance coverage of environmental liability  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage  its business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the forward looking statements assume that the company will not incur any material environmental liabilities other than those for which a provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the notes thereto 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of the company s contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
the company therefore believes it should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require the company to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
the company is unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
seasonality the company believes that its collection and landfill operations can be adversely affected by protracted periods of inclement weather which could delay the development of landfill capacity or transfer of waste and or reduce the volume of waste generated
