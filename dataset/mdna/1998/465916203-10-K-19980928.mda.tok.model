the selling and installation of both ride simulation theatres and large screen theatres includes providing all or part of the design of such theatres  sale of the projector screens  show control systems  motion simulators and sound systems 
the company s operating results in fiscal through fiscal have been adversely impacted by several trends and other developments 
revenues attributable to sales in asia declined from million in fiscal representing of the company s revenues to million in fiscal representing of the company s revenues 
in addition  the company did not enter into a new hardware sales contract for delivery in asia during the fiscal year this decline in revenues primarily resulted from the continuing impact of the economic downturn and deflationary environment recently experienced throughout most of the asia pacific region 
in addition  the company experienced a significant decline in sponsorship revenues during this period primarily resulting from the termination of a single contract with a major telecommunications company at t corp 
the company derived million  million and million of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  from sponsorship of its fleet of touring motion simulators 
sponsorship revenues prior to january were primarily derived from the company s advertising contract with at t corp  which had sponsored the company s touring motion simulators from march through september the company currently has only limited sponsorship contracts and the company has been unsuccessful in securing sponsorship arrangements that approach the levels enjoyed prior to fiscal in fiscal  the company sold one touring unit and continues to explore other strategic alternatives for the touring operations 
results were also impacted by certain one time charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took approximately million in charges  including a loss on impairment of assets  legal and dispute reserves  additional film amortization expense and an increase in bad debt reserve 
in fiscal results were adversely impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to a proposed merger between iwerks and showscan which did not receive the required shareholder vote in march in addition  in light of reduced revenues and earnings in fiscal and  during fiscal  iwerks reduced its workforce by approximately percent in order to more closely align staffing levels with expected revenues going forward 
in an unrelated event  effective february   charles goldwater was appointed chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president succeeding roy a 
wright 
results of operations the company derives its revenues primarily from three sources sales of hardware systems  owned and operated primarily portable simulation theatres  and licensing of films 
to a lesser extent  revenues are also earned from service to existing theatre owners  rental of facilities and camera equipment and production of films for third parties 
revenues for the fiscal year ended june   and are analyzed in the following table in thousands fiscal year ended june hardware sales service    owned and operated    film licensing    film production and other  revenues on sales of theatre systems are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the ratio of percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each fixed price contract  over the life of the contract 
accordingly  the timing of shipment schedules as dictated by the customer can result in variability of quarterly revenues and earnings 
likewise  the cash received and used for the contract can vary from quarter to quarter with the revenue and cost recognition on the contract 
the gross margin for each contract varies based upon pricing strategies  competitive conditions and product mix 
revenues from owned and operated o o consist of portable ride simulation theatre revenues derived primarily from ticket sales at state fairs  air shows  and similar events  as well as revenues derived from fixed site joint venture revenues which includes iwerks contractual share of the sites revenues or profits as applicable 
admission revenues from the portable ride simulation theatres are subject to variability due to the seasonal nature of these events and are higher during the summer months 
in addition  revenues from o o for fiscal and fiscal were benefited by significant corporate sponsorships 
sponsorship revenues for the portable theatres are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
sponsorship revenues recognized in fiscal were significantly lower than the fiscal and levels 
the company typically licenses its film software under one year film license agreements 
revenues and related expenses are recognized at the beginning of the license period at which time the customer is billed the license fee and film is delivered to the customer 
the company recognizes revenues and costs associated with the production of custom films at the time of completion and acceptance by the customer 
accordingly  the timing of completion of custom films can result in substantial variability of quarterly revenues and gross margin 
the company typically realizes a smaller margin from the sale of custom films in comparison to its theatre system sales 
a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  south america  europe and canada 
revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and attributable to sales to these areas are summarized in the following table in thousands percentage of percentage of percentage of amount total revenue amount total revenue amount total revenue asia    south america   including mexico europe    canada   total export revenues    the company maintained an office in hong kong and in june closed this office to affiliate with a sales representative that has offices in hong kong and shanghai to support sales to asia 
the company also maintains a satellite office in london  england to support its european sales 
south american sales are supported out of the sarasota  florida office 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency fluctuations  changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the united states and in certain other countries 
any resulting change in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect iwerks international operations 
political and economic factors have been identified by the company with respect to certain markets in which it competes 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not result in customers of the company defaulting on payments owed to iwerks  or in the reduction of potential purchases of the company s products 
recent turmoil in the economies of the countries in asia have had a material adverse affect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
revenues attributable to sales in asia declined from million for fiscal representing of the company s revenues to million in fiscal representing of the company s revenues 
in addition  the company did not enter into a new hardware sales contract for delivery in asia during the fiscal year ended june  subsequent to june   however  the company finalized two sales contracts totaling million with chinese customers and an additional two contracts totaling million with customers in japan 
if recent economic problems experienced in asia  russia  and eastern europe were to spread to europe  south america or the united states  it could have a material adverse affect upon the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company is not able to predict to what extent  or for what period  these economic trends may adversely affect the sales of its products 
typically  sales outside the united states are denominated in united states dollars and are backed by bank letters of credit  which reduce the risks related to international sales 
comparison of year ended june  to year ended june  revenues revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased million or from the fiscal year revenue 
hardware sales and service decreased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
most severely impacted were hardware sales in the asia pacific region  which decreased million due to the continued economic downturn in that part of the world 
north american and south american hardware sales declined in by million primarily as a result of timing of projects 
however  north american hardware bookings were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal owned and operated revenue decreased million or  primarily from the company s touring ride simulators reactors  due primarily to the loss of a major sponsor at t corp 
during fiscal year in addition  there was one less reactor in as it was sold in june of the loss of at t corporation accounted for million in lower revenues  however the general admission portion of this business increased by  the company continues to actively seek other sponsors as well as other alternatives to increase the utilization of the reactors 
film licensing revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to a net increase in the number of theatres which license films partially offset by pricing declines 
the increase in film production and other was primarily due to additional revenue generated for theatre and equipment rentals 
cost of sales cost of sales primarily includes costs of theatre systems sold  expenses associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres  and costs associated with film production and licensing fees 
the cost of theatre systems include the cost of components  customization  engineering  project management  assembly  system integration and installation 
also included in cost of sales are royalties payable to a former joint venture partner and estimated warranty expenses 
the costs associated with film license fees primarily reflect amortization of film production costs over the lives of certain films and royalties paid to third parties 
the cost of sales associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres include costs for personnel  depreciation and amortization  event fees  fuel  insurance and maintenance 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was and for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales  in compared with  as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the absorption of certain fixed overhead charges which did not decrease as revenues decreased 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include personnel costs  trade shows and other promotional expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  public relations costs  amortization of goodwill  professional fees  research and development costs and divisional administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses between fiscal and was due primarily to a million charge for severance payments made to employees  including the former chief executive officer and other officers  partially offset by a percent decrease in employee related expenses 
this decrease in employee related expenses was due primarily to lower overall staffing levels than that of the prior year as a result of work force reductions made in fiscal merger related expenses the company incurred a total of million of non recurring expenses related to the proposed merger with showscan which did not receive the required shareholder vote in march these costs were primarily professional legal  accounting and investment banking fees of which million was expensed in fiscal and  expensed in fiscal interest income expense interest income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from a reduction in the invested cash balances during the fiscal year 
interest expense for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
this decrease resulted primarily from the scheduled maturity of notes payable in fiscal income taxes the provisions for income taxes were  and  to the years ended june  and  respectively 
as the company has significant net losses  the income tax provisions are primarily for foreign taxes and minimum state taxes 
net income loss the company recorded net loss of  in  compared to a net loss of  in due to the reasons mentioned above 
comparison of year ended june  to year ended june  revenues revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased million or from the fiscal year revenue 
owned and operated revenue decreased million or  primarily from the company s reactors  due primarily to the loss of a major sponsor at t corp 
in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  fiscal revenue included a million cancellation settlement for an event which was to be held at world expo in tokyo  japan and there were no such cancellation revenue in fiscal during the remaining portion of the fiscal year the company aggressively pursued new sponsorship opportunities and looked at other options to replace these revenues 
the loss of the major sponsor  that utilized of the reactors throughout fiscal  resulted in excess capacity between early fall and late spring of fiscal in june  one of the reactors was sold to a customer in korea 
the million reduction in hardware sales and service resulted from a reduced number of hardware contracts in fiscal compared with fiscal film licensing revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to an increase in the number of theatres which license films 
the decrease in film production and other was due to no films produced in fiscal compared to two films produced in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales was and for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
one of the primary reasons for the decrease in the gross margins between fiscal and was due to million of charges to cost of sales made in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to changes in accounting estimates 
these included additional film amortization expense on films which have not achieved their projected revenue  additional reserve disputes  increased warranty reserve  due to increased work performance on a contract  and a reduction of previously recognized earnings by  in connection with the cancellation of a contract 
in addition  the costs related to the revenue received from the cancellation settlement of the tokyo world expo in were nominal resulting in an unusually high margin in fiscal which did not occur in fiscal selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses between fiscal and was due primarily to reduced employee related compensation million  legal and accounting expenses million and travel and entertainment expenses million 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts million  increased research and development expenditures million and increased accrued expenses related to a regulatory audit million 
loss on impairment of assets due to the company being unable to replace the major sponsorship revenue from at t corp 
for its portable simulation theatre business and the resulting excess capacity this generated during the winter months as described above in the revenues section  the company recognized a non cash charge of million in fiscal primarily for its portable simulation theatres in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb release number  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the loss was calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the portable simulation theatre assets over the estimated future discounted cash flow from these theatres during the next six fiscal years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impairment occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of disappointing results and an under utilization of reactors during the quarter  sponsorship and general admission events below expectations  and the lack of significant sponsorship backlog as of june  interest income and expense interest income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
this decrease resulted primarily from changes in the invested cash balances during the respective periods 
interest expense for fiscal and was  and  resulted primarily from financing costs on the portable ride simulation theatres 
income taxes the provisions for income taxes were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
as the company had significant net operating loss carry forwards  the income tax provisions are primarily for foreign taxes and state taxes 
net income loss the company recorded a net income of  in  compared to net loss of  in due to the reasons mentioned above 
seasonality and fluctuating quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited data regarding operations for each quarter of fiscal and and the percentage of the company s revenue and expenses represented by each item of the respective quarter 
this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and  in management s opinion  contains all adjustments necessary to fairly state the information set forth herein 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal first second third fourth first second third fourth dollars in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter revenue         cost of sales         gross margin      selling  general and administrative         merger related expenses loss on impairment of assets  interest income expense  net income loss before provision for taxes     provision for taxes net income loss     the company s operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of theatre system shipments  the mix of theatre system contracts  the completion of custom film contracts and the amount of revenues from portable simulation theatre and film licensing agreements 
hardware sales will likely continue to experience inexplicable quarterly fluctuations as they are substantially dependent on the customers varying delivery and installation requirements 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are primarily based upon revenue forecasts 
the decline in revenue  as shown in the above chart  is primarily from hardware sales which were significantly lower from customers in the asia pacific region 
the sales cycle for the sale of a single attraction by the company typically ranges between six and eighteen months 
the company has little control over the timing of customer purchases 
although revenue decreased in fiscal  backlog orders for new hardware contracts was higher at june  than on the same date in in fiscal  the fourth quarter net income was impacted by the charge for the asset impairments of million as well as cost of sales expenses totaling million for additional film amortization expense on films which have not achieved their projected revenue  additional reserve for disputes  increased warranty reserve and a reduction of previously recognized earnings in connection with the cancellation of a contract 
also selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts due to receivables which were deemed uncollectable  a legal reserve that first arose in the fourth quarter and increased accrual due to a regulatory audit 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to severance costs associated with a company wide layoff and termination of certain others  including the chief executive officer  as well as recruitment costs for new management and directors 
also as a result of this downsizing  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses were lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal the seasonal fluctuations in earnings also may cause volatility in the stock prices of the company 
while a significant portion of the company s expense levels are relatively fixed  the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on the company s forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
the company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations primarily from net proceeds of million from an initial public offering of the company s common stock in fiscal and cash flow from operations 
the company has also received cash in the amount of million for the sale of certain distribution rights during the three fiscal years ending june  and proceeds from the financing of certain equipment purchases 
in fiscal  approximately million in cash was used in operating activities 
iwerks major investing activities included the sale of debt securities partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and additions to the film library 
during fiscal  the major financing activities were the scheduled payments of capital leases and notes payable 
in fiscal  approximately million was provided by operating activities 
the company s major investing activities included investments in joint ventures for million  additions to film library of approximately million  acquisition of pioneer see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and related patent for million  and purchase of property and equipment for million 
financing activities included repayment of notes payable and capital leases of million 
at june  the company had cash and short term investments of approximately million compared to million at june  and million including long term investments of approximately million at june  in addition  the company maintained an unsecured million bank line of credit 
the company s cash and short term investment balances have continued to decline since june  and the company expects to experience further declining balances during the remainder of fiscal in addition  the history of losses and negative cash flow resulted in the company s bank terminating the company s line of credit 
management believes that its existing cash balances and short term investments  combined with anticipated cash flow from operations  will continue to decline  however they will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through the end of fiscal however  if the company is unable to achieve its projected cash flow from operations  the company may experience significantly reduced cash and short term investments  which could result in the company not being able to meet its operating needs 
recent operating losses  the company s declining cash balances  the ongoing financial turmoil in asia historically the company s largest market and a significant source of operating revenues  the company s historical stock performance  and a general decrease in investor interest in the company s industry  may make it difficult for the company to attract equity investments on terms that are deemed to be favorable to the company 
in addition  the losses in fiscal and fiscal make it more difficult for the company to attract significant debt financing 
although the company anticipates that its cash balances will decrease during fiscal  management is in the process of implementing a plan which it believes will facilitate a return to profitability and increase the cash flow beyond fiscal this plan includes  among other things  changes to senior management  expansion of the board of directors  developing and marketing new products  seeking new markets for the company s simulation and film capabilities  the establishment of new strategic vendor and customer partnerships and aggressively reducing expenses 
in the event that cash flow from operations is less than that anticipated  in order to preserve cash  the company would be required to reduce expenditures for capital projects including new films and research and development  or effect further reductions in its corporate infrastructure  any of which could have a material adverse affect on the company s future operations 
at june  the company was committed to approximately million of capital expenditures to be made in fiscal impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company with the assistance of consultants  has completed its initial assessment of its existing internal computer systems and after reviewing various factors  one of which being the year issue  has determined that modifications or upgrades to or replacements of certain software and hardware is required 
the company s most critical software systems are its assembly and financial software systems 
the company has determined that these systems will require replacement 
the company s initial estimate of the cost of such replacement is  which includes approximately  for the purchase and implementation of new software and hardware which will be capitalized and amortized over their respective useful lives and approximately  of which will be expenses in the period incurred 
the company has not yet completed the process of selecting its preferred systems or vendors and consequently the company s estimates may change depending upon the systems but does not believe they will be material 
at june   the company had incurred approximately  in connection with this project 
the company believes that the required changes to its existing computer systems will be installed and tested by june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
although the company believes that with these changes  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material additional costs caused by an undetected error or defect in the technology used in its internal systems which are purchased from third parties 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the conversion are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the company s engineers have reviewed all of the company s significant products and do not believe there is any date sensitive software included in products sold by the company since some products sold by omni entertainment  a company acquired in  may have date sensitive computers which may result in incorrect date displays 
the company is in the process of notifying these customers of this concern and is providing the necessary tools to test their equipment 
the company does not expect to incur a material cost to test or correct products initially sold by the company 
the company is also in the process of surveying key vendors to insure they are year compliant 
as of september  the company is unaware of any key vendors who are not compliant  however such survey is not yet complete 
factors that may affect future results history of operating losses  fluctuating periodic operating results and cash flow the company has sustained substantial operating losses in four of its last five fiscal years 
the company s revenues in fiscal decreased by million or from fiscal year revenues 
although the company expects to sustain a loss in the first quarter of fiscal  revenues will be higher than in the prior three quarters 
for all of fiscal  the company will not be able to achieve profitable operations unless revenues significantly increase to pre levels or above  or unless expenses are substantially decreased 
management believes that the fiscal revenues from hardware sales will exceed the fiscal level because the revenue to be recognized from the hardware sales backlog defined as a signed sales contract with a customer deposit at september  will exceed the hardware revenue recognized in all of fiscal additionally  while the company took measures in fiscal to decrease the level of its sg a expenses  management continues to examine its operations to achieve greater operating efficiencies and increase its revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitable operations in fiscal dependence on production of film software  financial risks of film production the company s ability to implement its business strategy depends in large part upon its ability to successfully create  produce and market entertainment and educational film software for exhibition in its theatre systems 
the size and quality of the company s library of film software titles is a material factor in competing for sales of the company s attractions and developing the company s base of recurring revenue 
the company has invested million  million and million in film software during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has commitments to invest approximately million in film software in fiscal the company s recent operating losses and declining cash balance have caused it to decrease the level of its investments in film software  which may have an adverse affect on revenues on future periods 
the company generally produces and develops specialty films and videos for its library with production budgets ranging from approximately  to million 
while the company may enter into participation  licensing or other financing arrangements with third parties in order to minimize its financial involvement in production  the company generally is subject to substantial financial risks relating to the production and development of new entertainment and educational software 
the company typically is required to pay for the production of software during the production period prior to release and typically is unable to recoup these costs from revenues from exhibition licenses prior to to months following release 
there can be no assurance that iwerks will be able to create and produce additional software for its library which will be perceived by its customers to be of high quality or high entertainment value 
at june   the company had recorded on its balance sheet million in film library costs 
the company periodically reviews the net realizable value of its film inventory and makes adjustments to its carrying value when appropriate 
while the current carrying value of the company s film inventory reflects management s belief that it will realize the net amount recorded on its balance sheet  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
intense competition  unpredictability of consumer tastes competition in each of the markets in which the company competes is intense 
the principal direct competition for customers comes from manufacturers of competing movie based attractions  and in the case of amusement and theme parks  manufacturers of traditional amusement park attractions 
in addition to direct competitors  there is also competition from systems integrators and some amusement and theme parks developing and constructing their own attractions 
many of the company s competitors have better name recognition  and substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
in the large screen  special format motion picture business  iwerks main competitor is imax 
the perforation millimeter film format is the most predominant large film format due primarily to the large number of films that have been available in that format 
imax is by far the dominant company in this market 
increasingly  large format films are being made available in the format  such as everest and others 
the company also sells systems that can benefit from this trend 
additionally  the out of home entertainment industry in general is undergoing significant changes  primarily due to technological developments as well as changing consumer tastes 
numerous companies are developing and are expected to develop new entertainment products or concepts for the out of home entertainment industry in response to these developments that are or may be directly competitive with existing products 
there is severe competition for financial  creative and technological resources in the industry and there can be no assurance that existing products will continue to compete effectively or that products under development will ever be competitive 
further  the commercial success of products is ultimately dependent upon audience reaction 
audience reaction will to a large extent be influenced by the audience s perception of how the company s products compare with other available entertainment options out of the home 
there can be no assurance that new developments in out of home entertainment will not result in changes in consumer tastes that will make the company s products less competitive 
new product development the company operates in a technology driven segment of the entertainment business 
as such the company must continually improve its products to increase their entertainment value while also facing pressure to continually reduce the price of its products to respond to competitive pressures 
the company intends to extend the current product line through innovative use of its current technologies 
this also can be accomplished with the company s effort to identify new strategic partners see business strategy section 
the company s recent operating losses and declining cash balances have caused it to consider reducing the level of its capital expenditures and research and development efforts 
the inability of the company to develop new products and to respond to technological developments of its competitors could have a materially adverse effect on its business  operations and financial condition 
international operations a significant portion of the company s sales and film licensing are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily  in the far east  europe  south america and canada 
during fiscal  and   and of the company s revenues  respectively  were derived from sales outside the united states 
during fiscal  no country other than the united states accounted for more than of the company s revenues 
during fiscal  china accounted for approximately of the company s revenues and in fiscal japan accounted for approximately of the company s revenues 
the company expects a significant portion between and of the company s sales in fiscal and will be to customers outside of the united states  similar to the percentage experienced in the past three years 
international operations and sales of the company may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations which  in the event of a decrease in value of foreign currency to the dollar can significantly affect the affordability of the company s products overseas  changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates  longer accounts receivable collection patterns  changes in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions and natural disasters 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the united states and certain other countries 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect the company s international operations 
political and economic factors have been identified by the company with respect to certain markets in which it competes 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not result in customers of the company defaulting on payments due to it  or in the reduction of potential purchases of their products 
the company does not engage in any hedging programs 
current trends in the global economy the company s revenues and profitability are dependent on the strength of the national and international economies 
in a recessionary or deflationary environment  sales of the company s products and products of other entertainment companies may be adversely affected 
theme parks and other out of home entertainment venues may also experience a downturn in sales which could reduce the funds available for capital improvements and film licensing  resulting in price and other concessions and discounts by the company in order to maintain sales activity 
recent turmoil in the economies of the countries in asia have had a material adverse affect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
revenues attributable to sales in asia declined from million for fiscal representing of the company s revenues to million in fiscal representing of the company s revenues 
in addition  the company did not enter into a new hardware sales contract for delivery in asia during the fiscal year ended june  subsequent to june  however  the company finalized two sales contracts totaling million with chinese customers and an additional two contracts totaling million with customers in japan 
if recent economic problems experienced in asia  russia  and eastern europe were to spread to europe  south america or the united states  it could have a material adverse affect upon the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company is not able to predict to what extent  or for what period  these economic trends may adversely affect the sales of its products 
dependence on directors and senior management  recent changes to key personnel during fiscal  many of the company s executive officers including its ceo have changed 
current executive officers are charles goldwater  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  bruce c 
hinckley  executive vice president  chief financial officer and secretary  jack shishido  senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing  jon corfino  senior vice president film development and distribution and dan griesmer  senior vice president and general manager 
further  during fiscal and the first two months of fiscal  as a result of downsizing and voluntary resignations  the company has experienced a reorganization in its sales  marketing  human resources  film distribution  engineering  project management and assembly staffs 
between march   and june  three members of the board of directors have resigned and since february three new board members have joined the company 
the company continues to search for one additional board member which will bring the total members of the board to seven 
the recruitment  retention and motivation of skilled directors  executives  sales  technical and creative personnel and other employees are important to the operations of the company 
the company s turnover in management personnel has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on iwerks management and other resources 
in addition  there is competition for management and creative personnel in the industries in which the company operates 
also  the recruitment and retention of qualified employees is restricted because as of september  the company has less than  shares available for future stock option grants under its existing stock option plans 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in the future 
should any key executive officer cease to be affiliated with the company before a qualified replacement is found  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
volatility of stock price the company s stock price has been  and could continue to be  highly volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially in recent periods 
during fiscal and through september   the company s market price has ranged from a low of  to a high of per share 
future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors and acquisition or loss of significant customers may affect or be perceived to affect the company s operations  or changes in earnings estimates by analysts  among other factors  could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
environmental matters and other governmental regulations under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or occupant of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
the company leases its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities 
the company could be held liable for the costs of remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances on such properties under the terms of the governing lease and or governing law 
although the company has not been notified of  and is not otherwise aware of  any current environmental liability  claim or non compliance  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in the future in connection with its leased properties 
in addition  the company s subcontractors and other third parties  with which it has contractual relations  are similarly subject to such laws 
effect of anti takeover provisions the company s board has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the company s stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of preferred stock
