general overview in july  the company commenced operations by acquiring substantially all of the assets comprising the retail optical business of ipco  including the assets then located in company owned stores  as well as franchise agreements and related documents pertaining to stores then franchised by ipco 
the expansion of the company s franchise system was primarily attributable to the conveyance to franchisees  by the end of  of the assets of of the initially acquired company owned stores and the acquisition  in april   of franchised stores in connection with the singer transaction 
in october  august  november  and may  respectively  the company replenished its inventory of company owned stores with the acquisition of company owned stores as part of the sfse merger which stores were in addition to ten stores then franchised by sfse  the acquisition of eight of the stores previously licensed by ipco to pembridge  the acquisition of company owned stores in connection with the benson transaction  and the acquisition of company owned stores which stores were in addition to the stores then franchised by vca in connection with the vca transaction 
the company currently derives its revenues primarily from i the sale of eye care products of which the sale of eyeglasses represented in excess of of total sales for each period since inception and by providing eye care services at company owned stores and in those franchised locations in which certain of the company s vcc operations are located  ii ongoing franchise royalties based upon the gross revenue of franchised stores  iii the conveyance of company owned store assets to franchisees  iv initial franchise fees  v interest income derived primarily from purchase money financing provided by the company on its conveyance of company owned store assets to franchisees and on the proceeds of the offering  until such time that the proceeds were expended  and  vi laser access fees paid by ophthalmologists utilizing the company s excimer lasers to perform prk procedures 
management s growth strategy is to transform the company from a retailer of optical products into a full service eye care company  including the management of its existing insight laser center and by developing affiliations with ophthalmologists to utilize the company s excimer lasers  while at the same time expanding the company s existing core business and customer base 
a key element of such strategy is to acquire existing retail optical chains  convert independently owned retail optical stores to franchised stores and open new stores 
average retail store sales and average ongoing franchise royalty information described below is computed based upon the weighted average of existing stores in each category
