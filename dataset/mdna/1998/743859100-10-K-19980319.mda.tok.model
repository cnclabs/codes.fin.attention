interest income  for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits as this presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion on net interest income should be read in conjunction with table analysis of changes in net interest income and table consolidated average balances  interest income and expense and yields and rates 
tax equivalent net interest income for increased million or from as average earning assets grew million over the prior year 
net interest margin grew by basis points primarily caused by an million increase in non interest bearing liabilities 
provident s interest income increased million or during the year primarily due to the growth in average earning assets plus a basis point increase in yield 
the increase in yield was mainly due to a continued shift out of investments into higher yielding loans 
the increase in average earning assets resulted from a million increase in the loan portfolios offset by a decline of million in investments and million in loans held for sale 
consumer loans grew million while the commercial business and real estate mortgage portfolios also experienced growth of million and million  respectively 
interest income earned on the loan portfolio increased million reflecting higher loan outstandings 
the yield on investments and loans increased basis points and basis point  respectively 
interest lost from non accruing loans was thousand compared to thousand in interest expense increased million from resulting from a million growth in average interest bearing liabilities 
the overall cost of funds increased basis points during as costs on total interest bearing liabilities increased basis points 
excluding the effect of off balance sheet positions in each year  total costs of interest bearing liabilities would have increased basis points 
the average rate paid on borrowed funds increased basis points during the increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflects a million rise in interest bearing deposits  million of which is associated with matched maturity brokered deposits and million with money market certificates of deposit 
non interest bearing demand deposit accounts grew by million or 
the corporation experienced a million drop in borrowed funds 
future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand and the general level of interest rates

the corporation continues to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of prior charge offs and potential problem loans 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in the decrease is mainly associated with the single commercial credit in noted above 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was

this change in policy was made to conform with standard industry practice

interest bearing demand money market deposits grew million or over last year while noninterest bearing deposits increased million or 
these increases are the result of continued promotion and sales efforts of retail deposit products 
income from mortgage banking activities decreased million  million due to lower gains on the sale of mortgage servicing rights  million in lower gains from sale of mortgage loans and million from lower origination income 
mortgage originations during the year declined million to million 
the changes resulted primarily from the interruptions of closing sales offices and shifting to a more indirect origination business 
provident investment center pic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank offers annuities and mutual funds through an affiliation with a securities broker dealer 
for the year  income associated with these products increased by thousand to million 
this increase is attributed to concentrated sales efforts towards these products 
loan fees increased thousand from  all associated with retail loan fees 
this increase is tied to an increase in loan volume

non interest expense non interest expense is composed primarily of costs associated with employees salaries and benefits  bank facilities  external data processing and regulatory fees

compensation decreased thousand while benefits were down thousand 
the decline in these categories is attributable to the change in the mortgage banking business from predominately retail to wholesale and savings associated with the merger 
full time equivalent employees for the year were  compared to  last year 
occupancy costs grew thousand or over last year 
this increase is mainly due to additional rent and leasehold improvements as the branch network increased to branches in  with five new in store locations 
total furniture and equipment expense increased thousand due to upgrading of technology in the bank s office automation and branch platform systems 
external processing increased million or  associated with increased account volume 
regulatory fees declined million  mainly associated with a one time saif special assessment of million paid by citizens saving bank in the third quarter of impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions 
the corporation utilizes a third party processor for the majority of its data processing requirements 
provident is working with this servicer as well as with all of the corporation s other significant suppliers of data processing software and hardware 
the corporation presently believes that timely modifications to existing software and or hardware will neutralize the year issue 
the corporation will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the corporation plans to complete the year project by december  the total cost of the year project is not expected to exceed million and is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the corporation plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
income taxes provident recorded income tax expense of million on pre tax income of million for an effective tax rate of 
this compares with a effective tax rate for this increase is related to permanent tax differences associated with the merger of first citizens financial corporation offset in part by a lower effective state income tax rate 
fourth quarter results provident recorded net income of million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  in the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  or  over the million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  recorded in the same period last year 
the higher earnings are principally due to a increase in net interest income  higher non interest income and lower operating expenses 
a higher loan loss provision as a result of loan growth and a rise in the effective tax rate partially offset these increases 
tax equivalent net interest income in the fourth quarter rose million to million as the net interest margin declined basis points to and average earning assets grew million to billion 
the decrease in the net interest margin primarily reflected a higher cost of borrowed funds as well as the effect of the amortization of closed off balance sheet transactions 
the corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the quarter to provide for loan growth in the portfolio 
non interest income increased percent to million 
the increase is derived from fee based services as a result of higher account volumes  security gains and increased fees and commissions 
fee income from deposit accounts increased million and net security gains increased million 
these increases were partially offset by lower mortgage banking income and lower other non interest income mainly associated with the successful settlement of litigation during the fourth quarter of non interest expense decreased thousand to million mainly because of lower salaries and benefits expense of thousand 
external processing costs rose thousand due to increased account volume and occupancy expense increased thousand

deposits in billions a major portion of provident s funding comes from core deposits which consists of consumer and commercial transaction accounts and consumer savings and time deposits 
these deposits are generated through the bank s branch banking locations 
at december   core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities 
provident s future funding growth is expected to be generated from deposit growth through strategies outlined below 
the branch network strategy includes traditional full service branch locations supplemented with in store branches 
in store branch locations are comprised of supermarket locations and national retail superstores 
provident bank of maryland as of december  had traditional branch locations and in store branches 
the corporation has an agreement with foodarama corporation to operate branches in their metro and basic supermarkets in the baltimore metropolitan area 
provident will selectively look for additional branch opportunities complementary to existing locations when the cost of entry is reasonable 
the corporation has seven in store branches planned for provident continues to attract increased commercial and retail deposits 
interest bearing demand money market deposit balances at december  were up million or compared to year end the bank also operates seven fast n friendly check cashing centers 
the purpose of the check cashing centers is to offer alternative banking services to a segment of our market place that does not utilize traditional banking services

this growth reflects provident s emphasis on full banking relationships with its retail and commercial customers 
average time deposits increased million or  million of which is attributable to matched maturity brokered deposits and million in money market certificates of deposit 
brokered deposits are utilized as a cheaper source of funds compared to other available sources of borrowed money

deposit maturities table maturities three months over three months over six months over dollars in thousands or less to six months to months months total balance      percent of total credit risk management much of the fundamental business of provident is based upon understanding  measuring and controlling credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risk  which is inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit loss 
for example  loans with generally low credit loss experience include home mortgage and home equity loans 
loans with medium credit loss experience are primarily secured products such as auto and marine loans 
the category with high credit loss experience includes unsecured products such as personal revolving credit 
in commercial lending  losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can vary widely from period to period and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
the evaluation of specific risk is a basic function of underwriting and loan administration  involving analysis of the borrower s ability to service debt as well as the value of pledged collateral 
policies and procedures have been developed which specify the appropriate credit approval and monitoring for the various types of credit offered 
the bank employs prudent lending practices and adheres to regulatory requirements including loan to value ratios and legal lending limits 
these procedures are modified periodically in order to reflect changing conditions and new products 
the bank s lending and loan administration staffs are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio  identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio  credit risk identification and review processes are utilized 
credit risk analysis assigns a grade to each commercial loan based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
an independent loan review function tests risk assessment and determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
financial accounting standards require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest on commercial credits to assess the need for providing for losses 
the corporation s credit procedures require monitoring of commercial credits to determine the collectibility of such credits 
if a loan is identified as impaired  it will be placed on non accrual status and recorded according to accounting guidelines 
as of december   there were million in commercial loans considered to be impaired 
loans provident offers a diversified mix of residential and commercial real estate  business and consumer loans 
as shown in table  the mix of loans outstanding has shifted to more consumer orientation over the past five years

loans in billions provident s residential mortgage lending includes the origination  sale and servicing of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans 
loans are originated through the loan production offices of provident mortgage corp 
financial accounting standards for mortgage banking enterprises that acquire mortgage servicing rights  and sells or securitizes those loans with servicing retained  require the allocation of the cost of the mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the loans 
mortgage origination activity in showed a slightly lower volume as originations totaled million in compared to million in in  originations are projected to exceed s production as more emphasis is being placed on the wholesale segment of the business 
during  income from the sale of loans was million while million was recognized from the sale of servicing assets 
the mortgage servicing portfolio ended the year at million 
the residential real estate mortgage loan balance at december  was million compared to million at the end of the prior year

provident s portfolio of acquired loans increased million on average  ending the year at million  and is predominately comprised of second mortgages 
consumer credit originated by provident increased million on average during  ending the year with a balance of million 
the majority of the increase is from automobile and marine loans 
most of the automobile loans are made through a network of auto dealerships in maryland  delaware  pennsylvania and virginia 
average auto loans made through this network of dealerships grew million ending the year at million 
average marine loan balances grew million during totaling million at year end  and were produced primarily through correspondent brokers 
average home equity lines of credit increased million during the year and totaled million at the end of while average direct second mortgage loans increased million and ended the year at million

properties securing the loans include office buildings  shopping centers  apartment complexes  warehouses  residential building lots and developments 
average commercial real estate mortgage loans increased million or while average commercial construction loans decreased million or 
average residential construction loans increased million or to end the year at million 
provident s commercial loan portfolio consists of general business loans  including asset based loans  primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the baltimore  maryland and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
the bank stresses the importance of asset quality as well as the development of new marketing programs 
average commercial loans grew by million or ending the year at million 
provident has minimal exposure to highly leveraged transactions 
hlts totaled million as of year end  and all are performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  renegotiated loans and real estate and other assets that have been acquired through foreclosure or repossession 
past due loans are loans that are days or more past due as of december and still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
beginning in  the corporation no longer places consumer loans on non accrual status to better conform to standard industry practice 
delinquent consumer loan outstandings and any uncollected interest are generally charged off at days and days  respectively 
information with respect to non performing assets and past due loans is presented in table for the years indicated 
as shown in the table  total non accrual loans decreased million  mainly in the consumer loan portfolio due to the change in policy as noted above  partially offset by increases of million and million in the commercial business and residential mortgage portfolios  respectively 
the increase in past due consumer loans is a result of a million or growth in the consumer loan portfolio 
as of december   non performing assets and past due loans ended the year at million and million  respectively 
see the discussion under loans the million in past due residential mortgage loans are guaranteed or insured by an agency of united states government and no significant loss is anticipated

allowance for loan losses provident maintains an allowance for loan losses which is available to absorb potential losses 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
determination of the adequacy of the allowance  which is performed quarterly  is accomplished by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves  based on historic and anticipated loss experience  to all other loans 
the following table reflects the allowance for possible loan losses and the activity during each of the respective years

allowance for loan losses to year end loans the continued emphasis on loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits has resulted in a strong credit portfolio 
senior managers meet at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is determined by management s evaluation of the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
based upon the evaluation of credit risk  provisions  in the form of charges to operations  are made to bring the allowance up to a level management believes is adequate 
an analysis of the loan portfolio was performed at december   and expected losses have been provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
during the loan loss allowance increased million to million at year end 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans was at december   compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the change in the consumer loan accrual policy offset partially by increases in non accrual loans for commercial business and residential mortgage 
the portion of the allowance which is allocated to non accrual loans is determined by estimating the potential loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
provident maintains a loan classification and review system to identify those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
estimated potential losses from internally criticized loans have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses

the investment securities portfolio includes mortgage backed securities  us government securities  municipal securities and asset backed securities 
in addition to investment securities  the corporation invests in federal funds sold  reverse repos  mortgage loans held for sale and other short term investments referred to in total as the investment portfolio 
the strategies employed in the management of these portfolios depend upon the liquidity  interest sensitivity and capital objectives and requirements of the corporation 
the treasury division executes these strategies

total securities held to maturity     total investment securities portfolio      total portfolio yield during  provident continued to enjoy a strong capital position  a high degree of liquidity  and a substantial level of core deposits 
management s principal objectives for the investment portfolio during were to maintain an appropriate level of quality  to ensure sufficient liquidity in various interest rate environments while maximizing yield and to increase net income by utilizing excess capital 
to successfully achieve these objectives  the corporation employs off balance sheet and on balance sheet strategies 
total investment securities decreased million during as a result of shifting funds into higher yielding loan portfolios 
the corporation applies the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
which requires investment securities to be segregated into three categories held to maturity  trading  and available for sale 
all securities in the available for sale category must be measured at fair market value 
the resulting gain or loss is excluded from revenue but is reflected as a change in stockholders equity 
trading securities must be measured at fair value and changes included in income for the period 
as of december   the corporation had no investments classified as trading securities 
securities designated as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
subsequent to the merger of first citizens financial corporation  provident disposed of certain securities classified as held to maturity by first citizens 
as a result of these transactions  all of the corporation s investment securities portfolio has been classified as available for sale 
additionally  all future purchases of securities will be classified as available for sale in the forseeable future 
at december   the available for sale portfolio included net unrealized gains of approximately million  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  in addition to unrealized gains and losses  provident realized million in gains and million in losses from the sale of securities from the available for sale portfolio in these sales were the result of management s continuous monitoring of the investment securities portfolio in terms of both credit quality and interest sensitivity 
liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
provident s asset liability management committee has established general guidelines for the maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
the committee continually monitors the amount and source of available liquidity  the time required to obtain it and its cost 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
the primary source of liquidity at december  was loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale  which totaled billion 
this represents of total liabilities compared to at december  maturities of investment securities  as table indicates  is expected to generate million in funds in and million  or  of the portfolio within the next five years

real estate mortgage residential     commercial     total loans     rate sensitivity fixed rate     variable or adjustable rate     total loans     core deposits are valuable in assessing liquidity needs because they tend to be stable with little net short or intermediate term withdrawal demands by customers 
at year end  core deposits represented billion  or  of total liabilities and of total assets 
an important element in liquidity management is the availability of borrowed funds 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  or  of liabilities in contrast to million  or  of liabilities at december  this decrease was the result of greater utilization of the broker cd market and the implementation of the money market cd product to match fund assets 
brokered cds at december  amounted to million  a million increase from the same period last year 
money market cds totaled million at december  the average maturity of short term borrowings at the end of the current year was days 
these borrowings are fully collateralized by us government or mortgage backed securities owned by the bank 
long term borrowings consisted of variable and fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank and totaled million as of december  it is anticipated that provident will continue to have access to the repurchase market and federal fund lines as well as short and long term variable and fixed rate funds from the federal home loan bank 
interest sensitivity management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings are subject to fluctuations which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize this risk 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process which is performed regularly as an important component of management s analysis of the impact of changes in asset and liability portfolios 
control of provident s interest sensitivity position is accomplished through the structuring of the investment and funding portfolios  securitizing loans for possible sale  the use of variable rate loan products and off balance sheet derivatives 
management does not try to anticipate changes in interest rates 
its principal objective is to maintain interest margins in periods of both rising and falling rates 
traditional interest sensitivity gap analyses alone do not adequately measure an institution s exposure to changes in interest rates because gap models are not sensitive to changes in the relationship between interest rates charged or paid and do not incorporate balance sheet trends and management actions 
each of these factors can affect an institution s earnings 
accordingly  in addition to performing gap analysis  management also evaluates the impact of differing interest rates on net interest income using an earnings simulation model 
the model incorporates the factors not captured by gap analysis by projecting income over a twelve month horizon under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
as of december   provident s interest sensitive liabilities exceeded interest sensitive assets within a one year period by million or of assets 
the bank s savings products are structured to give management the ability to reset the rates paid on a monthly basis 
this causes the bank to become more liability sensitive 
if interest rates rise  the rate paid on savings deposits may follow  and the corporation s net interest margin may decline 
management continues to take steps to protect the bank from possible increases in interest rates 
in these steps included lengthening the maturities on purchased funds and certificates of deposits and shortening asset maturities with interest rate swaps and caps 
management monitors the interest rate environment and employs appropriate off balance sheet strategies to address potential changes in interest rates 
these strategies lower the net interest margin but are designed to maintain an acceptable margin in a changing rate environment 
as a result  interest income has been decreased by thousand and interest expense has been increased by million  for a total decrease of million in net interest income for the year ending december  included in this net interest income decrease was the amortization of closed positions which reduced interest income by thousand and increased interest expense by million a net decrease of million in net interest income for the year ending december  without this  off balance sheet positions increased net interest income thousand for the year 
the forward yield curve indicates that short term and long term rates will each increase basis points over the next twelve months 
the corporation s analysis indicates that if management does not adjust its december  off balance sheet positions and the forward yield curve assumptions occur  off balance sheet positions would increase net interest income by thousand over the next twelve months 
this compares to an increase in net interest income of thousand should interest rates remain unchanged 
amortization of closed positions will reduce net interest income million over the next twelve months 
thus  without amortization of closed positions  net interest income would increase million over the next twelve months if the forward yield curve assumptions occur and million if rates remain unchanged as a result of these off balance sheet positions 
stockholders equity it is necessary for banks to maintain a sufficient level of capital in order to sustain growth  absorb unforeseen losses and meet regulatory requirements 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength 
in this environment  provident continues to maintain a strong capital position

during the second quarter of  the corporation issued a stock dividend and all earnings per share figures have been adjusted for this dividend and the for stock split in february provident exceeds all regulatory capital requirements as of december  the standards used by federal bank regulators to evaluate capital adequacy are the risk based capital and leverage ratio guidelines 
equity for regulatory purposes does not include market value adjustments as required by sfas no 
risk based capital ratios measure core and total stockholders equity against risk weighted assets 
provident s core capital is equal to its common stock  capital surplus and retained earnings less treasury stock 
the calculation of provident s total stockholders equity  for these purposes  is equal to the above plus the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
risk weighted assets are determined by applying a weighting to asset categories and certain off balance sheet commitments based on the level of credit risk inherent in the assets 
at december   provident s total capital ratio was compared to the minimum regulatory guideline of 
in addition  core common stockholders equity tier capital must be at least of risk weighted assets 
at year end  provident s tier capital ratio was 
the leverage ratio represents core capital  as defined above  divided by average total assets 
guidelines for the leverage ratio require the ratio of core stockholders equity to average total assets to be to basis points above a minimum  depending on risk profiles and other factors 
provident s leverage ratio of at december  was well in excess of this requirement

this improvement in earnings was attributable to a million rise in tax equivalent net interest income and a million increase in non interest income net of securities gains 
these increases more than offset a million increase in operating expense 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for increased million or from as average earning assets grew million over the prior year 
net interest margin dropped by basis points primarily caused by lower yields on interest earning assets 
the provision for loan losses increased million to million in the increase was the result of overall loan growth in the loan portfolios of million as total average loans outstanding grew by million
