decreased volume sales of the company s ship docking aid sensors were offset by increased survey and mapping sales 
larger sales of the company s ship docking systems were realized in as compared to  due to the company s completion of its contract with lockheed martin in management expects that sales of its ship docking aid systems will greatly fluctuate between financial periods due to the specialized nature of the business 
the decline in sales of the company s ship docking aid systems was offset by increased survey and mapping sales of the company s products 
survey and mapping sales rose to  in from  in due to increased volume sales of the second generation impulse series of survey lasers 
as market penetration of the company s second generation impulse expanded  sales of the company s criterion slowed as the impulse replaced first generation technology 
management believes that the smaller size and lower price point of the impulse make the technology more accessible for an increased number of users and applications in the survey and mapping industry 
traffic safety sales in were  compared to  realized in representing a decrease in the company s overall traffic safety revenues 
the decline in traffic safety sales in compared to was primarily related to lower international sales of the company s traffic safety products 
despite lower international revenues  domestic sales of traffic safety products rose to  in compared to domestic traffic safety sales of  due to the fourth quarter introduction of the ultralyte 
during the fourth quarter  the company introduced the ultralyte  a second generation successor of its marksman laser speed detection device 
management believes that traffic safety sales are beginning to benefit from second generation products such as the ultralyte and believes that sales of the company s traffic safety products should improve as this new product is fully introduced into the market 
international sales comprised of net sales in compared to in historically  the company experiences quarterly fluctuations in its foreign sales due to the placement of typically large orders for the company s marksman and laser digicam traffic safety products 
foreign sales of the company s products are expected to continue to comprise a significant portion of its revenues 
the company currently requires that all international sales be paid for with us dollars 
cost of goods sold decreased to  in from  in during  the company benefitted from manufacturing cost reductions related to its second generation impulse and ultralyte  designed to reduce manufacturing costs and improve production efficiency 
as a result  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to realized in management recognizes that competitive pressure may affect the company s gross profit margins 
such impact from reduced selling prices is expected to be offset by reduced manufacturing costs on second generation products 
such price reductions were not a significant factor effecting the company s revenues 
as second generation products become a larger percentage of overall sales  management expects gross margins to continue to improve 
the company anticipates that gross profit margins from international markets will remain consistent with those realized domestically in most international markets for the company s current product lines 
however  management believes that gross profit margins on high volume international sales of its laser speed detection systems may be less than those realized domestically due to reduced selling prices on high volume orders 
the company minimizes the effect of currency fluctuations by requiring payment in us funds 
total operating expenses increased approximately to  in from  for the comparable period

the company anticipates that operating expenses will continue to increase to support the company s continued growth as the company s sales increase 
however  management believes that operating expenses will increase at a slower rate  now that the company s investment in infrastructure is substantially complete 
royalty income primarily related to the company s agreement with bushnell on sales of the yardage pro series of laser range finders marketed by bushnell rose to  in from  realized in management believes that royalty income received from its current licensing arrangements related to the company s proprietary technology will continue to positively impact the company s results of operations

in april  the company s hand held marksman laser speed detection system was certified by the international association of chiefs of police iacp to meet the federal standard for laser speed detection devices 
upon receiving iacp certification  the marksman was subsequently placed on the iacp approved products list 
this list is comprised of speed enforcement products which have passed the national standard 
because the approval occurred so late in the year  management believes that law enforcement agencies deferred purchases of the company s marksman hand held laser speed detection system in order to purchase the marksman with federal funds 
international sales comprised in compared to in due to increased foreign sales of the company s laser digicam photo laser system and criterion and impulse survey lasers

foreign sales foreign sales of the company s products were  and the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
management believes that foreign sales of the company s products will continue to comprise a significant portion of its revenues 
the company requires that all international sales be paid for with us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make the company s products less competitive in those markets 
research and development costs research and development costs related to the continual development of the company s laser measurement instruments are expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses 
research and development costs totalled approximately   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
year to year increases in research and development expenditures are primarily attributable to increased personnel costs related to increased personnel requirements

the company believes that its current and planned facilities are adequate to meet the company s needs throughout the foreseeable future  and  that the capital invested to expand its facilities and resources did not have a material impact on the company s current working capital 
however  the company s results of operations were impacted by consulting fees related to the company s new systems implementation 
management believes that the company s business centered around its traffic safety product line is not seasonal in nature 
however  due to fiscal budgeting practices of foreign and domestic law enforcement agencies  sales of the company s traffic safety products may vary between financial periods 
historically  the company has realized a small decline in sales of its survey and mapping products in areas affected by colder weather in the winter months 
additionally  due to the sophisticated nature of the company s das ship docking aid systems  management expects sales of these systems to greatly fluctuate between financial periods 
since the majority of the company s sales are to government agencies  the company has historically realized minimal bad debts and maintains approximately a day receivable collection period 
in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations  all of the company s foreign sales are made in us currency 
the company generally enforces the use of letters of credit and wire transfers in most of its credit arrangements with foreign distributors to reduce the risk of uncollected accounts receivable 
since  an allowance for doubtful accounts of  has been recorded 
effect of inflation the company believes that it will experience increased costs due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  material and supplies  and equipment acquisitions
