item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cima is a drug delivery company focused primarily on the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products based upon its patented orasolv registered trademark technology for marketing by multinational pharmaceutical companies 
orasolv is an oral dosage formulation incorporating microencapsulated active drug ingredients into a tablet which dissolves quickly in the mouth without chewing or water and which effectively masks the taste of the medication being delivered 
orasolv s fast dissolving capability may enable patients in certain age groups or those with a variety of conditions that limit their ability to swallow conventional tablets to receive medication in a more convenient oral dosage form 
the company believes that orasolv is more convenient than traditional tablet based oral dosages as it dissolves quickly in the mouth and does not require water to be ingested  thereby enabling immediate medication at the onset of symptoms 
in addition  orasolv can provide more accurate administration of doses than liquid or suspension formulations as no measuring is required 
the company believes orasolv s ease of use and effective taste masking may foster greater patient compliance with recommended dosage regimens  both for over the counter otc and prescription products  thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing costs in the healthcare system 
cima s business focus has evolved over the last several years 
from inception until  the company focused on the development of liquid effervescent products and technologies 
in  the us patent covering orasolv was issued and the company  perceiving a greater commercial opportunity  shifted its focus to the development of orasolv products 
since the issuance of the orasolv patent in  the company completed construction on its current manufacturing facility and produced numerous full scale trial and validation batches  entered into various license and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies  and launched the first commercial product using the orasolv dosage form in the first half of these product sales in the orasolv dosage form have resulted in significant revenues for the company in the company s business strategy is to commercialize its orasolv technology through collaborations with multi national pharmaceutical companies with emphasis on products which command a large market share and or are in large market segments 
the company s current focus is primarily on the development and manufacture of orasolv products for the prescription market 
product differentiation and brand name identity are becoming more critical than ever to the successful marketing of pharmaceutical products 
increasingly pharmaceutical companies are emphasizing the development of strong prescription franchises through branding and direct to consumer promotional efforts 
the company believes that orasolv affords pharmaceutical companies a means to significantly differentiate their products in the competitive marketplace 
because it is a patented technology  orasolv allows extended market life to products that may go off patent and become subject to generic competition 
orasolv also affords more enduring product differentiation than the more traditional approaches of changing product flavor or packaging innovations  which can be easily replicated 
the company believes that this has allowed it to enter into agreements with a number of pharmaceutical companies for development  manufacture and commercialization of rx and otc products 
the company has also initiated the development of new drug technologies 
these technologies include new oral solid delivery systems  unique sustained released delivery systems and improved efficacy delivery systems 
the goal is to focus on technologies that improve efficacy 
major events that affected the company in included bristol myers squibb  one of our commercial partners  launched the first commercial product using cima s orasolv dosage form 
the product  tempra registered trademark  was first launched in the united states and then in canada 
the company established manufacturing credibility by producing approximately million tablets in under gmp conditions 
the company entered into a prescription agreement with schering plough to use our new orasolv registered trademark sr technology in an undisclosed prescription product 
the company entered into a prescription agreement with zeneca to develop and manufacture a quick dissolving line extension for zomig registered trademark  one of their major new prescription drugs used to treat migraines 
the company entered into a global non exclusive license agreement with bristol myers squibb for several potential otc products which would provide royalties to the company 
the company announced the mutual intention to terminate the collaboration with glaxo wellcome to produce an orasolv version of zantac for both the otc and prescription markets 
the company entered into an exclusive development and license option agreement with novartis consumer health for an undisclosed over the counter product in cima s orasolv dosage form 
the company initiated in house taste masking and drug coating activities 
cima is a delaware corporation incorporated in background drug delivery technology patient medications are available in a variety of delivery forms  including solid dosage forms  liquids  effervescents  transdermal delivery methods  inhalation devices and products  and intramuscular and intravenous injections 
enteral medication delivery includes those medications delivered through the stomach  including tablets  liquids and effervescents 
enteral medications are most frequently patient administered  because of their non invasive delivery method 
parental medications are those delivered by injection 
parenteral medications are most often administered by a healthcare provider 
the company believes the convenience of patient administration has made enteral medications in general  and tablets in particular  popular with patients  providers and payors 
industry sources estimate that patients most frequently receive medications in an oral tablet form 
however  children and the elderly  as well as those with certain physiological or medical conditions  frequently experience difficulty in swallowing tablets 
these patients often receive medications in liquid or effervescent form  or through parenteral methods as an alternative to tablets 
the company believes that tablets are a more convenient  accurate and effective medication form than are liquids or effervescents which may spill in the process of administering the medication  especially to children and are easier for patients to self administer than parenteral therapeutics 
recent trends in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries the healthcare industry has experienced significant change in the past and the company expects this change to continue for the foreseeable future 
the emergence of managed care organizations has focused providers and payors on the efficient utilization of healthcare resources 
in addition  the trend towards the capitation of fees  or management of a patient s health requirements for a pre determined  regular payment  has created an awareness among providers of the cost effectiveness of various medical treatments 
healthcare providers and payors have implemented a variety of strategies to reduce the cost of medical care  including the use of generic versions of prescription and non prescription drugs  the use of non prescription remedies and the use of therapies that have improved patient compliance 
the company believes that patient non compliance with medicinal dosing regimens is widespread  and that such non compliance results in unnecessary costs to the healthcare system 
these changes in the healthcare industry have also had an impact on participants in the pharmaceutical industry 
in particular  a greater emphasis on cost effectiveness by providers and payors has resulted in pharmaceutical companies developing products that reduce the cost of therapy 
these pharmaceutical companies have responded by developing treatments with improved efficacy  reduced complications and side effects  easier delivery and lower costs 
the focus on cost effectiveness has also led to the development of generic versions of off patent prescription drugs 
increasingly  healthcare payors and providers have embraced generic equivalents of branded drugs because generic drugs provide a substantial cost savings 
in addition  many pharmaceutical companies are extending their presence in a particular therapeutic area with the introduction of a non prescription  or otc  version of a prescription drug 
many patients and providers have indicated a preference for otc versions of prescription formulations because of the convenience that patient administration of otc therapies provides as well as the cost savings 
in addition  healthcare providers and payors have indicated a continuing interest in therapies that improve patient compliance which ultimately leads to significant healthcare cost savings 
as these pharmaceutical companies adjust to the evolving healthcare industry  they must differentiate their products in an increasingly crowded therapeutic market 
to do this effectively  they must develop products or product extensions that can successfully compete in the prescription  generic and otc market for drugs  develop products or product extensions that enhance patient compliance  and do all of this within a highly regulated and cost constrained environment 
another change affecting the healthcare industry has been the number and size of business combinations  strategic alliances  and mergers in both the pharmaceutical and the managed care industries 
in the pharmaceutical industry these changes are driving the major pharmaceutical companies to focus more and more on major new chemical entities nce s which might be block buster drugs 
the significant revenue and profit from these drugs present the major growth area for these companies 
drug delivery product development is increasingly being given to specialty drug delivery companies to provide unique development products that contribute important sales revenue and profit  but not at the level of block buster drugs 
the new managed care business environment provides even greater focus on patient benefits which  in most cases  are derived from a combination of blockbuster drugs and drug delivery development 
there is proposed us federal legislation which would grant pharmaceutical manufacturers who conduct pediatric research an additional six months of market exclusivity 
this serves to highlight the growing regulatory pressure to encourage the development of drugs formulated specifically for children 
the company sees this as a potential benefit as pharmaceutical companies explore various drug delivery systems 
market opportunity the company believes that its orasolv drug delivery system will provide benefits to patients as well as healthcare industry providers and payors 
these benefits  in turn  should provide marketing advantages to cima s pharmaceutical partners 
the benefit to patients is convenience  which the company believes will result in improved compliance with dosing regimens 
the benefits to providers and payors are lower costs resulting from such improved compliance with dosing regimens 
the benefits to pharmaceutical partners are the capabilities to leverage their drug delivery development programs by going to specialty drug delivery companies  like cima  for brand differentiation and the ability to retain brand integrity 
advantages for patients  providers and payors the company believes a broad group of patients could benefit from the orasolv rapid dissolve technologies because it enables immediate medication at symptom emergence and facilitates conformance to dosing regimens 
patient non compliance with dosing regimens has been associated with increased costs of medical therapies by prolonging treatment duration  increasing the likelihood of secondary or tertiary disease manifestation and contributing to over utilization of medical personnel and facilities 
by improving patient compliance  providers and payors may reduce unnecessary expenditures and improve therapeutic outcomes 
reduction of expenditures is an increasingly important issue to providers as capitated payment plans become more prevalent in the healthcare industry 
in addition to the general market applications  the company believes the orasolv technologies provides benefits to certain patient groups which experience significant difficulty in swallowing tablets 
such patient groups include children  the elderly and patients with certain anatomical or physiological deformities  certain disease indications or medication associated dysphagia 
the company has completed quantitative consumer testing with children and qualitative testing with physicians  nurses and managed care administrators for the elderly which indicate the potential for these demographic groups to better comply with dosing regimens and thus to benefit from the orasolv technology 
advantages for pharmaceutical partners the company believes that pharmaceutical companies are facing challenges to adjust to the evolving healthcare industry 
these challenges include the impact of generic competition  which generally results in lower pricing as well as a loss of market share  the impact of the increased role of managed care organizations  forcing increased economic considerations in patient care  the results of which can include shorter therapies and therapeutic substitution including less expensive products  and the need to maintain brand integrity with its inherent economic benefits 
pharmaceutical companies are addressing these issues in several ways 
they are attempting to develop new product forms which will demonstrate a medical and economic benefit to the patient 
for the most part  they use specialty drug delivery companies to do that 
they are also trying to develop products which will help to improve patient compliance  which should result in a patient s more rapid return to health 
finally  they are attempting to use approaches which can be patented or provide a technological differentiation in order to reduce the threat of competition 
the company believes that the orasolv technologies provides a means for its pharmaceutical partners to meet each of these challenges 
technology orasolv the company s orasolv technology is an oral dosage form which combines taste masked drug ingredients with a quick dissolving effervescent excipient system 
taste masking is achieved through a process of microencapsulation  which coats or entraps the active compound in an immediate release matrix 
the effervescent excipient system aids in rapid dissolution of the tablet  permitting swallowing of the pharmaceutical ingredients before they come in contact with the taste buds 
the orasolv tablet dissolves quickly without chewing or water and allows for effective taste masking of a wide variety of active drug ingredients  both prescription and otc 
microencapsulation the microencapsulation of the drug ingredients used in orasolv products is accomplished using a variety of coating techniques  including spray coating  spray drying  spray congealing  melt dispersion  phase separation or solvent evaporation methods 
the company typically contracts for the supply of microencapsulated drug ingredients with a number of different suppliers 
these coating techniques have generally been developed by the company s scientists in collaboration with its suppliers and are protected by patents or proprietary know how 
coating materials are designed to prevent the active drug ingredient in the orasolv tablet from coming in contact with the taste buds  but provide for immediate release or sustained release of the active ingredients in the stomach 
in  the company established its own  in house taste masking capabilities 
the company is using these capabilities to develop its own new products and support development of its partner s development programs 
quick dissolve the microencapsulated drug is combined with fast dissolving tablet materials  which can include a variety of flavoring  coloring and sweetening agents all materials generally recognized as safe materials gras and commonly used tablet excipients  such as binding agents and lubricants 
in addition  an effervescent system composed of a dry acid and a dry base is added to the tablet excipient to facilitate a mild effervescent reaction when the tablet contacts saliva 
this effervescent reaction accelerates the disintegration of the tablet through the release of the carbon dioxide 
as the orasolv tablet dissolves  it releases the microparticles of drug into the saliva  forming a micro suspension of the drug in the saliva 
this microencapsulated drug suspension enters the stomach through the normal swallowing process 
new technologies durasolv tm  an oral dosage system designed to improve manufacturing efficiency 
currently  a significant component of orasolv s manufacturing cost is a consequence of the sophisticated packaging systems necessary to protect the softer  more friable orasolv tablets 
durasolv is a higher compaction solid oral dosage system formulated to achieve all the benefits of a quick dissolve dosage system  such as orasolv  but capable of being packaged in traditional packaging systems such as foil pouches or bottles at much higher production rates and lower packaging costs 
the key advantages of a harder tablet are a more robust tablet leading to lower manufacturing costs  and simpler  faster and more cost effective packaging 
the company has successfully developed prototypes in this dosage system  filed a patent application  and conducted stability tests 
consumer testing has demonstrated high acceptability of this technology  comparable to that of orasolv 
to date  the company has no agreements with corporate partners related to this technology 
orasolv registered trademark sr is a sustained or controlled release  quick dissolve system designed to improve convenience and compliance 
this system incorporates time release beads  providing the traditional benefits of a sustained or controlled release of active ingredients with quick dissolve s improved convenience 
the two key advantages are use of the sustained release systems of our partners which has already been approved by the fda  and unique formulations that allow easy swallowing of the sustained release active 
the company s agreement with schering plough utilizes this new technology 
an improved efficacy system utilizing effervescent tablets  granules and films 
cima is developing effervescent systems to target buccal and sublingual systemic and site specific drug delivery 
systemic delivery of active drug ingredients through the oral mucosal membrane has the advantage of improving bioavailability  advancing the onset of therapeutic action and avoiding first pass metabolism effects 
there is physiological and pharmacokinetic evidence that effervescent agents can enhance the absorption rate of active ingredients across mucosal membranes 
patents and proprietary rights the company actively seeks  when appropriate  protection for its products and proprietary information by means of us and foreign patents  trademarks and contractual arrangements 
in addition  the company relies upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of its proprietary information and products 
cima holds six issued us patents and several foreign patents covering its technologies 
the core patent relating to the orasolv technology relates to the taste masking  microencapsulation and quick dissolving excipient technology incorporated in products utilizing the orasolv technology 
a corresponding european patent has been issued 
the orasolv us patent was issued in and expires in two of the issued us patents relate to the production of compressed effervescent and non effervescent tablets using a particular lubricant developed by the company 
in  the company entered into a licensing agreement with smithkline beecham  under which cima acquired a non exclusive  worldwide license to make  have made  use and sell products covered by a particular us patent issued to smithkline beecham which may cover certain orasolv products 
in consideration  cima is obligated to pay smithkline beecham a royalty of of amounts received by the company in respect of orasolv products 
the license extends for the life of smithkline beecham s patent  which expires in issued us patents held by cima and their dates of expiration are set out in the table below 
as with any patent  the actual scope of coverage afforded by each of cima s patents is governed by the language of the patent claims themselves 
the descriptions set forth in the table below are intended solely for ease of identifying patents relevant to various technologies 
they are not intended as a representation regarding the scope of patents 
patent technology covered date issued date expires  certain orasolv technology 
 the production of compressed effervescent and non and and  effervescent tablets using a particular lubricant developed by the company two patents 
 effervescent pediatric vitamin and mineral supplement 
 the formulation of a base coated  acid effervescent mixture manufactured by controlled acid base reaction 
the obtained mixture can be used in the formulation of acid sensitive compounds with orasolv technology or other effervescent based products 
 taste masking of microparticles for oral dosage forms 
as a consequence of the company s patent position  an off patent or near off patent drug active can be combined with the company s technology in a new  competitively differentiated and patent protected dosage form 
the company holds two patents in australia  which issued in  and one euro patent  which issued in the company also has a total of us and foreign patent applications  including two european patent office filings 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its products  its new technology and to preserve its trade secrets 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company s patent applications will be approved or that any issued patents will provide competitive advantages for its products or will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
the company s ability to commercialize its products will depend on not infringing the patents of others  and protecting the company s own proprietary technology  which may involve litigation 
whether or not the outcome of any litigation concerning patents and proprietary technologies is favorable to the company  the cost of such litigation and the diversion of the company s resources during such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see item legal proceedings 
much of the company s technology is dependent upon the knowledge  experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel 
to protect rights to its proprietary know how and technology  company policy requires all employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the company 
these agreements also require disclosure and assignment to the company of discoveries and inventions made by such persons while devoted to company activities 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
in addition  it is possible others may infringe the patent rights of the company 
the company may desire or be required to obtain licenses from others with respect to materials used in the company s products or manufacturing processes  including drug coating techniques 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that any licensed patents or proprietary rights will be valid and enforceable 
strategy the company s goal is to have its proprietary drug delivery technology incorporated into as many pharmaceutical products as possible with an emphasis on pharmaceutical products which command a large market segment 
initially the company focused its efforts on otc marketed products which benefit from quicker time to regulatory approval and marketing which has served to establish cima and its technology in the market and provide near term revenue 
the company s longer term strategy is to build on this base and expand into the prescription market 
the prescription market offers significantly more attractive royalty rates and higher manufacturing margins 
cima s priority is to focus on developing orasolv formulations of prescription branded pharmaceuticals as well as generics and  in particular  those products which have application to pediatric and geriatric markets 
product therapeutic classes to which the company believes its orasolv technology potentially can be applied are highlighted in the table below  together with the target patient population 
prescription markets potential areas of orasolv application therapeutic area patient population antibiotics pediatric anti asthmatics pediatric anti epileptics pediatric cough cold allergy all cardiovascular adult geriatric anti migraine adult geriatric anti emetics all anti depressants pediatric geriatric anti psychotics pediatric geriatric anti anxiety pediatric geriatric cancer geriatric aids adult pediatric parkinson s alzheimer s geriatric the company s primary strategies are to collaborate with corporate partners for marketing of products 
the company has entered into and intends to continue to enter into agreements with pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies for the development and marketing of products that incorporate the orasolv technologies 
the company will refine the orasolv formulation of a particular oral therapeutic and manufacture it for its partners 
these partners will market and sell the orasolv versions of the therapeutic 
the company believes this strategy will reduce the time required to market products  extend patent life for certain actives and take advantage of the industry knowledge and presence of its partners 
develop proprietary technologies 
the company continues to develop proprietary technology and obtain patents thereon 
to date  the company has six us and two australian patents  one europatent and eleven patent applications 
the company believes that patented products and technologies provide attractive marketing features for use by its corporate partners 
in  the company initiated the development of three new technologies durasolv tm  orasolv registered trademark sr and improved efficacy systems 
consumer use testing has already been completed on durasolv demonstrating its feasibility and acceptance by patients 
orasolv sr has also passed the feasibility stage and is the technology being utilized in the schering plough partnership 
retain manufacturing rights 
the company intends to continue to develop orasolv formulations of oral therapeutics for its partners  to manufacture commercial quantities of these products in its facility in eden prairie  and to rely on its partners to market and sell the orasolv formulations 
the company believes this strategy enables it to better and more effectively manage increasing manufacturing volumes  control quality of the products it manufactures and manufacture in small or varying batch sizes  each of which provide it with a competitive business advantage 
retain ownership of products developed in collaborations 
the company has retained and intends to continue to retain ownership of its orasolv technologies developed for its partners 
the company believes this practice  in the case of generic and otc monographed products  will provide it with the flexibility of entering into collaborations with other potential partners should the initial partner decide not to pursue the commercialization of a particular orasolv product 
agreements with corporate partners the company s business development efforts are focused on entering into development  licensing and manufacturing agreements with pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies 
under these agreements  the corporate partner will be responsible for marketing and distributing the developed products either worldwide  or in specified markets or territories 
the collaborative arrangements typically begin with a research and development phase which  if successful  may be followed by a development and license option agreement for development of product prototypes and then license and manufacturing agreements for commercialization of such products 
alternatively  the company may develop product prototypes internally and enter directly into a development  manufacturing or license agreement for commercialization of those products 
the company s future ability to generate revenue is dependent upon the company s ability to enter into collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and other corporate partners to develop products that meet the requirements of its corporate partners  and upon the marketing efforts of these corporate partners 
the company believes these partners will have an economic motivation to market the company s products  however  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to marketing are not within the control of the company 
certain of the company s otc products are seasonal in nature and the company s revenues could vary materially from one financial period to another depending on which of such products  if any  are then being marketed 
in an attempt to alleviate such risk  the company is focused on developing for its partners a mix of otc and prescription products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future or that any current or future collaborative arrangements will result in successful product commercialization 
to the extent that agreements with corporate partners cover products to be sold internationally  such sales could be adversely affected by governmental  political and economic conditions in other countries  including tariff regulations  taxes  import quotas and other factors 
the table below sets forth the partners  market segments and cima technology for the company s major collaborative arrangements 
pharmaceutical collaborations partner market segment technology bristol myers squibb pediatric analgesics orasolv registered trademark bristol myers squibb multiple products orasolv registered trademark novartis undisclosed orasolv registered trademark smithkline beecham plc undisclosed orasolv registered trademark schering plough undisclosed orasolv registered trademark sr zeneca anti migraine orasolv registered trademark further information is confidential as disclosure of the product category may force the collaborative partner to alter its marketing plans  which could have a material effect on the eventual marketing of the product 
bristol myers squibb the company started manufacturing commercial quantities in of an orasolv dosage form of tempra registered trademark  bristol myers squibb s pediatric analgesic 
tempra quicklets tm  launched in the united states  competes directly against children s tylenol registered trademark and contains the drug active common to these products acetaminophen 
the product was also introduced in canada as tempra registered trademark firsttabs tm by mead johnson  a subsidiary of bristol myers squibb 
the company has received milestone payments for the development of this product  manufacturing fees  and royalty payments on end market sales 
in addition  the company announced in the signing of a global non exclusive license agreement with bristol myers squibb  which covers multiple products to be developed by bristol myers squibb applying or utilizing the orasolv technology to be sold in various territories 
this agreement makes provision for advanced royalty payments  minimum royalty payments over a four year period and royalties at market rates on total end market sales 
novartis consumer health in december  the company announced that novartis entered into a development and license option agreement which covers the application of orasolv to novartis product line 
similar to the above agreements  the company will receive option and development fees in exchange for the license option and development work 
smithkline beecham in april  the company entered into a license agreement with smithkline beecham to develop and commercialize an orasolv dosage form of one of smithkline beecham s major otc products 
under this agreement  cima received a license fee and has and will receive milestone payments and royalties on end market sales in countries where the company holds patents on its orasolv technology and half the base royalty rate on end market sales in other countries 
this product was covered by the original license and development option agreement  which was between cima and sterling winthrop  inc  which has now expired 
the company is currently negotiating a supply agreement to manufacture the product covered by the license agreement 
if the company is successful in negotiations  it is anticipated that the company could start manufacturing this product as early as schering plough the company entered into a development and option agreement with schering plough in august the agreement calls for the development of an orasolv sr version of an undisclosed  currently marketed prescription product 
in exchange for the development work and license option  the company will receive an option fee and development fees 
zeneca in september  the company entered into a development and license option agreement with zeneca to develop an orasolv version of zeneca s anti migraine drug  zomig registered trademark 
the agreement entitles the company to development and option fees 
glaxo wellcome plc the company entered into a development and license agreement with glaxo wellcome for the development of an orasolv formulation of zantac  glaxo wellcome s otc switch product for heartburn 
in  the company and glaxo wellcome announced their intention to end this collaboration 
this will allow cima to focus its resources on prescription collaborations and strategic otc opportunities which the company believes are of greater economic values 
research and development the research and development r d department at cima is focused on the development of oral dosage forms based on cima proprietary technologies and new proprietary oral dosage forms focused on improving both compliance and efficacy 
the r d department includes scientists recruited from the r d groups of major us pharmaceutical companies 
currently r d personnel and support systems and facilities are organized in a way to effectively develop formulations from bench scale through full scale commercial size under gmp conditions 
such development is carried out at the r d facilities in brooklyn park  minnesota and in the full scale manufacturing facility in eden prairie  minnesota 
the company believes that its r d facilities are in compliance with cgmp 
in both facilities  small cgmp batches are manufactured  packaged and released to support initial studies in humans  including both consumer studies for otc products and clinical studies for prescription products 
these efforts are conducted to support the company s strategic and business goals 
the company s r d department is devoted to the development of drug delivery technologies and dosage forms for pharmaceutical applications 
the key goals for the r d team are develop innovative drug delivery systems that fulfill the pharmaceutical partners needs and meet the strategy of the company  develop  expand and support systems required to fulfill cgmp production at commercial levels necessary to meet the requirements of major pharmaceutical companies  recruit and train high quality technical and scientific personnel  and support the company s intellectual property process 
in  the company submitted a provisional patent filing on durasolv  a more robust rapidly dissolving tablet technology that can be packaged using traditional pharmaceutical packaging equipment 
accelerated stability data has been collected on product packaged in bottles and foil packets for several prototype formulations 
these efforts have not only resulted in a new potential technology but significant enhancements which were incorporated in the base orasolv technology as a result of these efforts 
another accomplishment in was the signing of cima s first agreement to develop an orasolv sr product 
the current agreement calls for the use of a partner s existing sustained release particles in a rapidly dissolving dosage form 
the next step in the development of this technology will be the internal development of sustained or controlled release coated actives for inclusion into orasolv sr 
the first internally developed orasolv sr product is expected to be on stability by the end of due to a significant increase in partner related development activity during the second half of  the timeline for submission of an ind for an enhanced efficacy dosage form was delayed 
prototype formulations have been developed and placed on stability 
the first dosing of human subjects is expected during the third quarter of additional resources have been hired to focus exclusively on the research and development of new drug delivery systems 
at the early stage of development  the feasibility of these technologies appears promising 
however  there are numerous risks and uncertainties inherent in any r d program 
factors that could cause these programs not to reach the commercialization stage include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the research will not be able to be patented or the patent enforced  the inability to scale up and manufacture these new technologies in a cost effective manner  the ability to find a partner to market the product  and the eventual market acceptance of this new technology 
for the years ended december   and  cima s total expenditures for r d were   and  respectively  of which amounts r d fees from the company s collaborative partners were   and  respectively 
manufacturing a key component of the company s strategy is to be the primary manufacturer of orasolv and its other future drug delivery products 
advantages of this strategy include the ability to retain control of its technology  increase production quickly  refine the production process as necessary to bring orasolv and other future products to market rapidly and successfully  and generate a revenue stream from manufacturing 
the company s orasolv production facility  which also houses the company s headquarters is located in eden prairie  minnesota 
the company began occupying and making leasehold improvements to the new facility in late june and the facility was completed in december the company has operated one production line at this facility which is capable of producing to million tablets a year 
the facility is designed to be expandable to six production lines and efforts are underway to design and select a second production line as warranted 
the company expects six production lines to be more than sufficient capacity to meet the company s long term manufacturing needs 
the production equipment consists of state of the art material transfer and blending systems and integrated high speed tableting and packaging operations 
the configuration of the facility  the production flow layout and the equipment has been designed by the company s personnel and consultants 
most of the equipment consists of high quality components commonly used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  selected for ease of operation  cleaning  changeover and cost effectiveness 
the production line is capable of packaging a variety of package designs with rapid conversion between sizes 
modern technology is also utilized for hour environmental control and monitoring of air quality  temperature  humidity and pressure differentials in all production areas 
although the orasolv process uses many standard pharmaceutical production components  some equipment was specifically developed to meet the unique requirements of orasolv products 
the company has developed a manufacturing process that allows high speed packing of soft  friable tablets without breakage into specially designed protective  child resistant packages in a controlled  low humidity environment 
to date  cima is the only company that has proven it has this capability in a production mode 
after conducting over full scale developmental runs and making production equipment refinements  the manufacturing facility  equipment and process have all been successfully validated 
additionally  extensive package transit testing and consumer testing confirmed the integrity of the package through all modes of transport to the final customer without product damage 
after completion of validation  the quality of the manufacturing facility  equipment and procedures were confirmed through the successful inspection by the state of minnesota  the fda and medicines control agency authorities 
in addition  there have been numerous successful site audits conducted by major pharmaceutical companies 
the production facility complies with current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
the active ingredients used by the company are readily available from suppliers 
in certain cases  the active ingredients are shipped to coating material suppliers where appropriate coating materials are applied to microencapsulate the ingredients 
in other cases  the company may purchase the microencapsulated active ingredient from a supplier 
the pharmaceutical ingredients and other supplies to be used in manufacturing orasolv products are standard pharmaceutical products available from numerous suppliers 
most coating materials are also available from numerous suppliers 
in some instances  however  certain coating materials or techniques may be available only from a single supplier 
if any such coating materials or techniques were to become unavailable  the company believes that satisfactory alternative materials or techniques could be substituted 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing operations would not be disrupted 
any such disruption could have an adverse effect on the company s business and potentially damage relations with its corporate partners 
in february  cima began commercial production for the first commercial launch by bristol myers squibb of a product incorporating the orasolv technology 
since then  the company has been producing commercial orasolv product utilizing multiple shifts 
it has gained valuable knowledge to make improvements in production efficiencies and operating speed and to reduce wastage 
marketing the company s marketing strategy is to rely on its corporate partners for the marketing and sale of its products 
the company believes this strategy will enable it to respond quickly to market demands  while avoiding the effort and expense associated with the establishment of an end user marketing capability 
the company s marketing department has focused on promoting the benefits of orasolv to its corporate pharmaceutical partners and with conducting consumer surveys and physician research of various orasolv formulations 
the company believes that its rapid dissolving tablet technology competes favorably to its competition 
in a recent quantitative consumer study conducted by a major independent market research company and sponsored by the company  significantly more consumers liked the orasolv formulation versus the zydis registered trademark formulation rp scherer corporation of the same drug 
currently  the company has corporate collaborations with bristol myers squibb  schering plough  zeneca  novartis consumer health and smithkline beecham 
competition competition in the areas of pharmaceutical products and drug delivery systems is intense 
the company s primary competitors in the business of developing and applying drug delivery systems include companies which have substantially greater financial  technological  marketing  personnel and research and development resources than the company 
the company s products will compete not only with products employing advanced drug delivery systems but also with products employing conventional dosage forms 
new drugs or future developments in alternative drug delivery technologies may provide therapeutic or cost advantages over the company s potential products 
among the technologies expected to provide competition for the company s orasolv technology is the zydis technology developed by rp scherer corporation scherer and the shearform matrix technology developed by fuisz technologies  ltd 
fuisz 
the zydis technology is a fast dissolving oral drug delivery system based on a freeze dried gelatin tablet 
the shearform matrix technology has application to two tablet formats  one of which involves waterless  fast dissolving oral delivery which fuisz calls flashdose registered trademark 
the principal competitive factors in the market for rapid dissolving tablet technologies are compatibility with taste masking techniques  dosage capacity  drug compatibility  cost and ease of manufacture  patient acceptance and required capital investment for manufacturing 
the company believes that its rapid dissolving tablet technology competes favorably with respect to these factors 
in a recent quantitative consumer study conducted by the company  significantly more consumers liked the orasolv formulation versus the zydis formulation of the same drug 
both scherer and fuisz have been successful in licensing their technologies to a number of pharmaceutical companies 
the company also believes that certain pharmaceutical companies may be developing other rapid dissolving tablet technologies which might be competitive with the company s technology 
government regulation all pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation of their activities  including research and development and production and marketing  by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
in the us  pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  storage  record keeping  labeling  advertising and promotion  and marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if a company fails to comply with applicable requirements  it may be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as civil penalties  criminal prosecution of the company  its officers and employees  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production and fda refusal to approve pending premarket approval applications or supplements to approved applications 
in general  fda approval is required before a new drug product may be marketed in the us however  most otc drug products are exempt from the fda s premarketing approval requirements 
in  the fda instituted the ongoing otc drug review in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of all otc drugs then on the market 
through the otc drug review process  the fda issues monographs that set forth the specific active ingredients  dosages  indications  and labeling statements for otc drugs that the fda will consider generally recognized as safe and effective and therefore not subject to premarket approval 
for certain categories of otc drug products not yet subject to a final monograph  the fda usually will not take regulatory action against such a product unless failure to do so poses a potential health hazard to consumers 
the company s initial product launch was an otc drug product that did not require fda approval 
products subject to final monographs  however  are subject to various fda regulations such as those outlining cgmp requirements  general and specific otc labeling requirements including warning statements  the restriction against advertising for conditions other than those stated in product labeling  and the requirement that otc drugs contain only suitable inactive ingredients 
otc products and manufacturing facilities are subject to fda inspection  and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may lead to administrative or judicially imposed penalties 
future marketing of products not formulated in compliance with final otc drug monographs typically will require a formal submission to the fda  such as a new drug application nda or supplement to existing new drug application snda  and ultimate approval by the fda 
this application and approval process can be expensive and time consuming  typically taking from six months to several years to complete 
further  there can be no assurance that approvals can be obtained  or that any such approvals will be on the terms or have the scope necessary for successful commercialization of these products 
the company expects that any required fda approvals in connection with the introduction of new  non monographed products would be sought by the company s corporate partners 
marketing of such products could be delayed or prevented because of this process 
even after a nda or snda has been approved  existing fda procedures may delay initial product shipment 
delays caused by the fda approval process may materially reduce the period during which there is an exclusive right to exploit patented products or technologies 
even if any required fda approval has been obtained with respect to a product  foreign regulatory approval of a product must be obtained prior to marketing the product internationally 
foreign approval procedures vary from country to country and the time required for approval may result in delays in or ultimately prevent marketing 
the company expects to rely on its pharmaceutical company partners to obtain any necessary government approvals in foreign countries 
however  considerable amounts of company time and resources may be required to support the approvals of these foreign filings 
prescription drug products with proven safety and efficacy profiles may be switched to otc status through the submission to and approval by the fda of a supplement to an existing nda 
the information and data required to support a switch application vary with individual drugs 
in some cases  the manufacturer may be required to conduct clinical investigations or other scientific studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for otc use 
in evaluating an otc switch  the fda considers whether the drug product is safe for use by consumers without the supervision of an appropriate licensed healthcare professional 
as prescription drug products are switched to the otc market  pharmaceutical companies face the same challenges to establish brand identification and product differentiation as they face with current otc drug products 
although switched products in certain cases may be eligible for a three year period of market exclusivity during which time the fda will not consider any andas for the same drug  the company believes that its orasolv drug delivery system can help its corporate partners differentiate their products during any exclusivity period and maintain a competitive advantage thereafter 
if a generic version of a drug already approved under an nda and no longer subject to any fda marketing exclusivity  is bioequivalent to the approved product  preparation and submission of an anda will be the most time and cost effective approach to fda approval 
the methodology for establishing bioequivalence through in vitro or in vivo methods is viewed to be straightforward 
because cima s taste masking systems are used in immediate release dosage forms  this approach is generally the most expeditious 
certain drugs may raise distinctive issues  such as a need for a unique approach to proving bioequivalence 
in those cases  premarket approval under section b of the food  drug  and cosmetic act would be more appropriate 
section b allows the fda to approve an nda using shortened procedures  usually for drugs that have proven safety profiles because of their marketplace performance among a large population group 
in a b application  a company may rely on clinical investigations conducted by others to which it does not hold a right of reference 
in general  a b application is supported by two or three clinical studies among the target population group designed to verify the safety and efficacy of the drug product in that population using the target dose and dose sequence 
the cost of this approach  which is generally used when a new delivery system or indication is added to an existing drug product  is typically much less than a standard nda 
the time to approve may also be shorter than a traditional nda and  in some cases  an anda 
each domestic drug product manufacturing facility must be registered with the fda 
each manufacturer must inform the fda of every drug product it has in commercial distribution and keep such list updated 
domestic manufacturing facilities are also subject to at least biennial inspection by the fda for compliance with cgmp regulations 
compliance with cgmp is required at all times during the manufacture and processing of drug products 
cima s existing manufacturing facilities have been inspected periodically by the fda 
the fda last inspected the eden prairie facility in november  and the brooklyn park facility in january no observations were cited during either inspection 
while the company s new orasolv manufacturing facility is required to be registered with the fda and to comply with cgmp regulations at all times  fda approval was not required prior to commencement of manufacturing otc drug products 
even though the company has worked diligently to assure compliance with fda regulations and has been audited by the quality control compliance groups of several of its current and potential corporate partners  there can be no guarantee that fda inspections will proceed without any compliance issues requiring the expenditure of money and resources to resolve 
the company s facilities have been inspected by and the company has received a license from the minnesota board of pharmacy to manufacture drug products in its facilities 
the company is also subject to regulation under various federal and state laws regarding  among other things  occupational safety  environmental protection  hazardous substance control and product advertising and promotion 
in connection with its research and development activities and its manufacturing  the company is subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
the company believes that it has complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and it has not been required to take any action to correct any material noncompliance 
the company does not currently anticipate that any material capital expenditures will be required in order to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws or that compliance with such laws will have a material effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
the company is unable to predict  however  the impact on the company s business of any changes in such environmental laws or of any new laws or regulations that may be imposed in the future and there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant compliance costs or be held liable for damages resulting from violations of these laws and regulations 
business risks the company considered itself a development stage company until the fourth quarter of and must be evaluated in light of the uncertainties and complications present for any such company and  in particular  one in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company has accumulated aggregate net losses from inception through december  of  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development of the company s technologies and from general and administrative costs 
these costs have exceeded the company s revenues 
in early  the company recorded the first commercial sales using it s orasolv technology 
prior to this the company s revenues had been derived primarily from the manufacturing of autolution and other non orasolv products under agreements with third parties 
the company no longer manufactures such products and no longer derives revenues from their manufacture 
in more recent years  revenues have been generated from research and development fees  and licensing arrangements 
the company expects to continue to incur losses through there can be no assurance that the company will ever generate substantial revenues or achieve profitability 
the company believes that its currently available funds  together with any license fees and sales revenue anticipated to be received in the future  will meet its needs at least through thereafter  or sooner if conditions make it necessary  the company will need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  including equity financings which may be dilutive to stockholders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds if its capital resources are exhausted  or that funds will be available on terms attractive to the company or at all 
the company is dependent upon its ability to enter into and perform under collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of its products 
failure of these partners to market the company s products successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s revenues are also dependent upon ultimate consumer acceptance of the orasolv drug delivery system and or its new drug delivery technologies as an alternative to conventional oral dosage forms 
the company expects that orasolv products will be priced slightly higher than conventional swallow or chewable tablets 
although the company believes that initial consumer research has been encouraging  there can be no assurance that market acceptance of the company s orasolv products will ever develop or be sustained 
the company began manufacturing orasolv products in commercial quantities in february commercial sales have been made and revenue has been recognized from sales of orasolv products 
to achieve future desired levels of production  the company will be required to increase its manufacturing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that manufacturing can be scaled up in a timely manner to allow production in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the company s corporate partners 
furthermore  the company has only one manufacturing line and one facility capable of manufacturing products 
if this production line and or facility becomes damaged or becomes incapable of manufacturing products due to natural disaster  governmental regulatory issues or otherwise  the company would have no other means of producing orasolv products 
the company intends to increase its research and development expenditures to enhance its current technologies  and pursue internal proprietary drug delivery technologies 
even if these technologies appear promising during various stages of development  they may not reach the commercialization stage for a number of reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities of not finding a partner to market the product  of being difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical to market 
the quick dissolve drug delivery field is fairly new and rapidly evolving and it is expected to continue to undergo improvements and rapid technological changes 
there can be no assurance that current or new competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which are being developed by the company or which could render the company s technology and products non competitive or that any technology developed by the company will be preferred to any existing or newly developed technologies 
the company has conducted an initial review regarding the effect the upcoming year will have on its computer applications 
the company has determined that the year issue will not have a material impact on it s business  operations nor its financial condition 
it is anticipated that minimal financial and human resources will be utilized to address that issue 
the company computer support is provided by a server supported  pc based lan system 
software vendors for the software used by the company are aware of the issue and the company has been informed that they have taken necessary steps to address the date field issue 
however  the conversion is an uncertainty and there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not arise in connection with this issue 
employees as of march   the company had full time employee  of whom hold degrees at the doctorate level 
of these employees are engaged in research and development  in manufacturing  in compliance  in quality control and in administration  business development  finance and human resources 
most of the company s scientific and engineering employees have prior experience with pharmaceutical or medical products companies 
no employee is represented by a union  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
the company believes its employee relations are good 
the success of the company and of its business strategy is dependent in large part on the ability of the company to attract and retain key management and operating personnel 
such individuals are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers 
in particular  the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain the services of its executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more members of management or key employees or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed may have a material adverse effect on the company 
liability insurance the company s business involves exposure to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the production and manufacture of pharmaceutical products 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  any such claims could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company currently has product liability insurance with coverage limits of  per occurrence and  on an annual aggregate basis 
the company s insurance policies provide coverage on a claims made basis and are subject to annual renewal 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that the company will be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of its products proceeds or that any insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
item properties the company has leased a  square foot facility in eden prairie  minnesota  a suburb of minneapolis  which houses its corporate headquarters and has been prepared for use as an orasolv production facility 
this lease has an initial term expiring on june  with minimum annual base rent payments exclusive of real estate taxes of approximately  through june  the rent payments will be recalculated on june   and june  based on an index rate 
the rent may increase  but will not decrease 
the company has the option to extend the lease term one period of ten years with a minimum annual base rent payment exclusive of real estate taxes and maintenance fees of  for the first five years  and  for the second five years of the ten year term 
the company also leases  square feet of office  research and development and manufacturing space in brooklyn park  minnesota 
the lease on the brooklyn park facility expires in september  but is renewable at the company s option for an additional three year period and two additional five year periods 
the company currently pays approximately  in annual base rent exclusive of real estate taxes and maintenance fees 
the company s existing facilities are believed to be adequate to meet its present and future requirements  and the company currently believes that suitable additional space will be available to it  when needed  on commercially reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings on october   the company instituted an opposition proceeding in the european patent office seeking cancellation of a patent owned by laboratories prographarm of chateauneuf  france prographarm 
the company has alleged in the opposition proceeding that publications exist which are prior art against the european patent  including an international patent  application owned by the company which was published prior to the priority date of the european patent 
on february   the united states patent and trademark office uspto suspended prosecution of a us patent application owned by the company to consider the company s request that an interference proceeding be declared between a pending us patent application owned by the company and a us patent owned by prographarm 
the company is seeking a determination by the uspto that either i the company s personnel are the prior inventors of the invention encompassed by the prographarm us patent and accordingly that the company is entitled to claims directed to the same invention in a new patent to be owned by the company  or ii in the alternative  a determination that the claims are unpatentable to the company or prographarm 
either holding would result in cancellation of the prographarm us patent 
the company s factual allegations are the same as in the european opposition  and further include the company s pending us patent application itself and the priority date of such pending application

general the company was founded in  and focused initially on contract manufacturing liquid effervescent products 
in september  patent claims were allowed on the company s orasolv registered trademark technology 
following issuance of the orasolv registered trademark patent  cima changed its focus and emerged as a drug delivery company emphasizing primarily developing and manufacturing pharmaceutical products based upon orasolv registered trademark 
orasolv registered trademark is an oral dosage form which incorporates mircoencapsulated drug ingredients into a tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth without chewing or water and which effectively masks the taste of the medication being delivered 
additional drug delivery technologies are also under development by the company 
in early  the company recorded its first commercial sales using the company s orasolv registered trademark technology 
prior to this  the company s revenues had been from sales using the company s autolution registered trademark a liquid effervescent technology  license fees paid by corporate partners in consideration of the transfer of rights under collaboration agreements  and research and development fees paid by corporate partners to fund the company s research and development efforts for products developed under such agreements 
in  commercial sales of orasolv registered trademark accounted for over half of the company s revenues  with the balance generated from research and development fees and licensing arrangements 
in the two prior years  the company s revenues were generated primarily from research and development fees and licensing arrangements  and minor revenues were generated from manufacture of liquid effervescent products 
the company no longer manufactures liquid effervescent products  and has not recognized any revenues from such products since in addition to revenues from manufacturing products  research and development and licensing  the company has funded operations from private and public sales of equity securities  realizing net proceeds of approximately  from private sales of equity securities and  and  from the company s july and may public offerings of its common stock  respectively 
the total shares outstanding at december  were  the company expects that losses will continue through at least  even though cima expects to be generating revenues from manufacturing  licensing arrangements  and research and development fee related to orasolv registered trademark products 
at december   the company had accumulated net losses of approximately  research and development expenses will increase as cima investigates new drug technologies  including the possibility of utilizing sublingual systems 
personnel costs for research and development are expected to increase as personnel will be needed to support the development programs for our new corporate partners and if efforts investigating new technologies prove to be successful 
as cima continues production  additional operations personnel may need to be added to meet corporate partners orders 
management anticipates administrative support to remain stable 
manufacturing infrastructure should not increase as there is capacity to meet short term production needs 
the company s ability to generate revenues is dependent upon its ability to develop new  innovative drug delivery technologies and to enter into and be successful in collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies for the development and manufacture of orasolv registered trademark products to be marketed by these corporate partners 
the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the corporate partners to successfully market orasolv registered trademark products 
although the company believes these partners have and will have an economic motivation to market these products vigorously  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to marketing are not within the control of the company 
these partners independently could make material marketing and other commercialization decisions which could adversely affect the company s future revenue 
the company s revenues could vary materially from quarter to quarter due to the company having relatively few agreements with corporate partners  causing research and development fees to fluctuate  and the fact that certain of the company s products are seasonal in nature and revenues could vary depending on corporate partners ordering patterns 
in recent years  the company has actively marketed its orasolv registered trademark technology to the pharmaceutical industry 
the company is presently engaged in product development and manufacturing scale up efforts with several different pharmaceutical companies regarding a variety of potential products 
in the first quarter of  cima began commercial production for bristol myers squibb of the first product in cima s orasolv registered trademark dosage form  which was officially launched in september in the second quarter of  the company expanded its relationship with bristol myers squibb and signed a global non exclusive license agreement which covers multiple products 
in the third quarter of  the first two prescription product license and development agreements were signed 
each agreement is for a product which is currently marketed by the company s partners  schering plough and zeneca 
in the fourth quarter of  a development and license option agreement was signed with novartis consumer health  inc there can be no assurance that any of these activities or discussions will result in the eventual marketing of products using orasolv registered trademark or the company s other technologies 
the company believes that mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years  together with changes in product plans by potential partners  may have had an adverse effect on the progress of certain projects  and the eventual marketing of products incorporating the company s technologies 
results of operations years ended december    and the company s results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the initial sales of two product launches utilizing the company s orasolv registered trademark technology and the signing of new agreements with major multinational pharmaceutical companies 
in  product sales were  in  product sales were zero as the company ceased to manufacture liquid effervescent products 
in  liquid effervescent product sales were  as contract manufacturing was de emphasized 
research and development fees and licensing revenues were   and  in   and respectively 
this increase in fees and revenues is a reflection of the progress of the development agreements and development of relationships in the prescription pharmaceutical marketplace 
the company continues to have relatively few agreements with corporate partners and  therefore  it expects that these revenues will tend to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis 
in  cost of goods sold were  these costs include the costs of entering into production and sale of products utilizing the orasolv registered trademark technology 
in  cost of goods sold decreased to zero from  in  resulting from the discontinuation of liquid effervescent contract manufacturing 
research and development expenses were   and  in   and  respectively  reflecting the move to commercial production in the decrease in from was the result of a one time product development optimization charge in of  from an independent consultant for improving product taste and packaging of orasolv registered trademark products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in  and  in selling  general and administrative costs increased in from  primarily due to increased bonus payouts to management and spending on consumer studies to support orasolv registered trademark marketing claims  but were still below levels 
expenses decreased in from due to downsizing and reduced executive bonus payouts 
net interest income was  in compared to  in  and  in net interest income is dependent upon the cash position of the company and the decrease in is due to the reduced cash position 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily through private and public sales of its equity securities and revenues from manufacturing agreements 
through december   cima has received net offering proceeds from such private and public sales of  and had net sales of approximately  among other things  these funds were used to purchase approximately  of capital equipment  including approximately  in the last two quarters of in connection with completing the company s new eden prairie manufacturing facility 
in july the company completed an initial public offering of shares of its common stock  realizing net proceeds of approximately  and in may the company completed another public offering of shares of its common stock  realizing net proceeds of approximately  the funds raised in cima s initial public offering have been used to build out the manufacturing facility  purchase and validate the appropriate production equipment  complete the research and development facilities  and purchase the necessary equipment for that facility 
in  cima successfully completed an fda establishment inspection  a minnesota state inspection  and was granted a drug enforcement agency license 
the company has used the funds raised in its may public offering primarily to prepare for commercial production in its new manufacturing facility  which began in the first quarter of  and to fund research and development for the application of the orasolv registered trademark technology and new technologies to pharmaceutical products 
the balance of such funds will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the company s long term capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the status of the company s collaborative arrangements  the progress of the company s research and development programs  receipt of revenues from the collaborative agreements  sales of the company s products  and the need to expand production capacity 
cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were approximately  at december  the company believes that its currently available funds  together with any license fees  product development fees  and sales revenue anticipated to be received in the future  will meet its needs through thereafter  or sooner if conditions make it necessary  the company will need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  including equity financing which may be dilutive to shareholders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds if its capital resources are exhausted  or that funds will be available on terms attractive to the company 
the company has not generated taxable income through december at december   the net operating losses available to offset taxable income were approximately  because the company has experienced ownership changes  pursuant to internal revenue code regulations  future utilization of the operating loss carry forwards will be limited in any one fiscal year 
the carryforwards expire beginning in as a result of the annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce potential federal income tax liabilities 
year issue the company has conducted an initial review regarding the effect the upcoming year will have on its computer applications 
the company has determined that it will not have a material impact on cima s business  operations nor its financial condition 
it is anticipated that minimal financial and human resources will be utilized to address this issue 
the company computer support is provided by a server supported  pc based lan system 
software vendors for the software used by the company are aware of the issue and the company has been informed that they have taken necessary steps to address the date field issue 
however  the conversion is an uncertainty and there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not arise in connection with this issue
