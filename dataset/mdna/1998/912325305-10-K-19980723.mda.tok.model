the warrants are exercisable at any time after june  until june  investor did not acquire any interests in the spin off companies 
in conjunction with the strategic restructuring plan  us office products completed the following financing transactions the financing transactions in june pursuant to a tender offer  the company repurchased million of its convertible subordinated notes due the notes for a purchase price of of the principal amount and accrued interest on the notes 
in fiscal  the company will record an extraordinary gain of million  before provision for income taxes  on the early extinguishment of the notes 
in addition  in fiscal  the company will record a non cash expense of approximately million  before benefit from income taxes  related to the write off of debt issue costs capitalized in connection with the issuance of the notes 
pursuant to an exchange offer  the company exchanged million of its convertible subordinated notes due the notes for  shares of common stock at an exchange rate of shares of us office products common stock for each  principal amount of the notes  which effectively reduced the conversion price of the notes from to and prior to the reverse stock split while the exchange offer was open 
in fiscal  the company will record a non cash expense of million as a result of the reduction in the conversion price of the notes 
in addition  in fiscal  the company will record a non cash expense of approximately million  before benefit from income taxes  related to the write off of debt issue costs capitalized in connection with the issuance of the notes 
the company entered into a new  million senior secured bank credit facility the credit facility that consists of the following i a million seven year multi draw loan facility  ii a million seven year revolving credit facility  iii a million seven year term loan facility  and iv a million eight year term loan facility 
as a result of the company entering into the credit facility  the company terminated its former credit facility which will result in the company recording a non cash expense of approximately million  before benefit from income taxes  in fiscal  related to the write off of debt issue costs capitalized in connection with the former credit facility 
the company issued and sold million in senior subordinated notes due the notes in a private placement at of the principal amount 
as a result of the strategic restructuring plan  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the results of those companies owned by the spin off companies and thus included in the distributions as discontinued operations 
the company s continuing operations consist of its north american office products group which includes office supply  office furniture  and office coffee  beverage  and vending service businesses naopg  mail boxes etc 
mbe which the company acquired in november  the company s operations in new zealand and australia  and the company s interest in dudley stationery limited  a uk contract stationer 
the naopg operates primarily in the united states  it also includes three coffee and beverage businesses located in canada 
the company s continuing operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of a wide variety of office supplies  office furniture  and other office products  including office coffee  beverage  and vending products and services to corporate  commercial and industrial customers 
cost of revenues represents the purchase price for office supplies  office furniture and other office products and includes occupancy and delivery costs and is reduced by rebates and discounts on inventory when such inventory is sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent product marketing and selling costs  customer service and product design costs  warehouse costs  and other administrative expenses 
following completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the company expects to focus more on expanding existing operations and improving their profitability and less on growth through acquisitions 
the company believes that the majority of its future acquisitions will be of smaller businesses and that  as a result  acquisitions will account for a much smaller percentage of the company s overall revenue growth than in the past 
see item business 
the company also expects that in the future it will report net income and net income per share amounts that are significantly less than the amounts that have been reported historically 
management believes that this will be the result primarily of three factors i substantially higher amortization expenses as compared to prior periods as a result of reclassifying business combinations as purchase acquisitions including the acquisition of mbe  rather than under the pooling of interests method  as the company had originally intended  ii substantially higher interest expense  as a result of increased borrowing that the company incurred to help finance the cost of the equity tender and the financing transactions  and iii higher effective income tax rates  due to increased non deductible goodwill expense and lower income before provision for income taxes 
rather than net income and net income per share  management believes that a more meaningful indication of the company s performance will be cash flows from operations and earnings before interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation expense and amortization expense ebitda 
the company expects to focus substantial attention on operating strategies intended to increase ebitda both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues 
as the company derives approximately one third of its revenues from operations in new zealand and australia  the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position will continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which have deteriorated significantly in new zealand and australia since the beginning of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting the company s business 
consistent with the objectives of the strategic restructuring plan and as part of the company s increased focus on operational matters  the company expects to undertake cost reduction measures including the elimination of duplicative facilities  the consolidation of certain operating functions  and the deployment of common information systems 
the implementation of the cost reduction measures will involve the incurrence by the company of certain restructuring costs 
the company is currently developing formal plans to implement such a restructuring 
once developed  any such plans will necessarily require review by the company s senior management  and the implementation of such plans would not be initiated prior to the receipt of proper authorization by the company s senior management 
the company has announced that it expects such a plan will be committed to in the first quarter of fiscal and estimates that the costs of such a plan may range from million to million  slightly more than half of which will be cash charges paid out over approximately a three year period as the company consolidates existing facilities 
the company estimates that this charge  together with the approximately million of costs associated with the strategic restructuring plan approximately million of which are non cash charges  will result in total restructuring charges of approximately to million 
the company expects to record all of these one time charges in the first quarter of fiscal no authorization for any of these costs occurred during fiscal except where specifically noted  the discussion of financial condition and results of operations that appears below covers only the company s continuing operations 
for additional information about the results of discontinued operations  see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
the company s financial condition and results of operations have changed dramatically from the company s inception in october to april  as a result of the company s aggressive acquisition program 
the company completed business combinations related to continuing operations and related to discontinued operations from its inception through the end of fiscal  of which were accounted for under the pooling of interests method related to continuing operations and related to discontinued operations 
during fiscal  the company completed an additional business combinations related to continuing operations and related to discontinued operations 
as a result of the board s adoption of the strategic restructuring plan in january  all business combinations completed during fiscal were accounted for under the purchase method 
prior to the adoption of the strategic restructuring plan  of the fiscal business combinations had been accounted for under the pooling of interests method related to continuing operations  including the acquisition of mbe  and related to discontinued operations 
following adoption of the strategic restructuring plan  the company restated its historical consolidated financial statements to account for these business combinations under the purchase method 
the company s consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method during fiscal and and include the results of companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method from their respective acquisition dates 
due to the company s growth through acquisitions  year to year comparisons of the historical results of the company s operations have been affected primarily by the addition of acquired companies 
in most instances  dollar increases in the various revenue and expense components of the company s results are due primarily to growth from acquisitions 
neither the magnitude nor the source of such year to year changes is necessarily indicative of changes that will occur in the future 
as noted above  the company expects to focus more on improving and expanding existing operations  and less on acquisitions as a means of growth 
the company also expects that the impact of acquisitions on the future results of the company s continuing operations will decrease because the size of companies that it expects to be available for acquisition will be smaller than in prior periods and the company s existing operations are larger than in prior years 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  fiscal year ended april  april  april  revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization expense non recurring acquisition costs restructuring costs operating income interest expense  net other income income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and extraordinary items provision for income taxes income from continuing operations before extraordinary items income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income before extraordinary items extraordinary items losses on early terminations of credit facilities  net of income taxes net income consolidated results of operations year ended april  compared to the year ended april  consolidated revenues increased  from  million in fiscal  to  million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to acquisitions 
revenues for fiscal include revenues from companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal the fiscal and purchased companies 
revenues for fiscal include revenues from of the fiscal and purchased companies for a portion of such period 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by the effect on international revenues of the devaluation of the new zealand and australian dollars versus the united states dollar usd 
because revenues generated in new zealand and australia contributed approximately one third of the company s consolidated revenues in fiscal  management estimates that the currency devaluation had the effect of reducing the company s increase in reported consolidated revenues in us dollar terms by approximately 
international revenues increased  from million  or of consolidated revenues in fiscal  to million  or of consolidated revenues in fiscal the increase in international revenues was primarily due to the inclusion  in the revenues for fiscal  of revenues from companies that were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal  the most significant of which was whitcoulls group limited  which the company s wholly owned subsidiary blue star group limited acquired in july revenues from of such companies were included in international revenues for a portion of fiscal the growth in international revenues was partially reduced by a decline in the exchange rates of the new zealand and australian dollars against the usd 
international revenues in new zealand and australia  calculated in their local currencies  increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal from april  through june  these exchange rates declined further

gross profit increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in revenue mix  primarily as a result of acquisitions  to revenues from traditionally lower margin products and services 
in addition  the company experienced a slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company believes that a number of factors have contributed to this slight decline and is currently working to isolate and address such factors 
this decrease was partially offset by improved purchasing and rebate programs negotiated with vendors 
the company expects to continue to negotiate favorable purchasing and rebate programs with vendors 
however  the company does not believe that it will be able to continue to improve these programs at the same rates as in the past  as significant progress has already been made with vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of the results of the fiscal and purchased companies 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to several factors  including i a shift in revenue mix  primarily as a result of acquisitions  to revenues from products and services traditionally having lower selling  general and administrative expenses  ii reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses by the company through the consolidation of certain redundant facilities and job functions  and iii reductions in the level of many general and administrative expenses incurred by the company through the negotiation of national or other large scale contracts with the providers of certain services affecting these general and administrative expenses 
the company has historically utilized grants of employee stock options as a method of incentivizing employees by increasing their ownership interest in the company  which the company believes has the effect of more closely aligning their interests with the interests of stockholders of the company 
as a result of this use of stock options  if the company had recorded compensation expense based upon the fair market value of such stock options on the dates of grant under the methodology prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company s income from continuing operations for fiscal would have been reduced by approximately million or 
in addition  as a result of the distributions  and consistent with and the anti dilution provisions of the company s stock option plan and generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company adjusted the number of employee stock options and the exercise prices of such options to keep option holders in the same economic position immediately before and after the distributions 
the net impact of this adjustment and the additional adjustment made under the stock option plan to reflect the reverse stock split was to reduce the number of options outstanding by slightly more than one half and to slightly less than double the exercise prices of such options 
because the reverse stock split reduced the number of shares outstanding by  these option adjustments had the effect of increasing the number of stock options outstanding  as a percentage of total shares outstanding 
as a result of these adjustments as of july   the company was not able to grant additional stock options to employees  as the company s stock option plan prohibits additional grants to be made if such additional grants would cause the total number of stock options outstanding to exceed of total shares outstanding 
the company is currently reviewing its cash and non cash compensation programs to ensure that they remain competitive and to assess what approach it should take to future long term incentive awards including stock options and other equity based awards 
the company believes that it offers market competitive cash compensation packages and does not expect that the current limits on its ability to issue stock options will have a material adverse impact on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
amortization expense increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this increase is due exclusively to the increase in the number of purchase acquisitions  including the acquisitions related to continuing operations that had originally been accounted for under the pooling of interests method but were restated as purchase acquisitions as a result of the strategic restructuring plan  included in the results for fiscal versus fiscal the company expects that amortization expense will be higher in fiscal because amortization expense from these acquisitions will be included for the entire year 
see factors affecting the company s business intangible assets 
the company incurred non recurring acquisition costs of approximately million during fiscal  in conjunction with business combinations that were accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the company did not incur any non recurring acquisition costs in fiscal because all of the company s acquisitions in fiscal were accounted for under the purchase method 
these non recurring acquisition costs included accounting  legal and investment banking fees  real estate and environmental assessments and appraisals  various regulatory fees and recognition of transaction related obligations 
gaap requires the company to expense all acquisition costs both those paid by the company and those paid by the sellers of the acquired companies related to business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
in accordance with gaap  the company may be unable to utilize the pooling of interests method to account for acquisitions for a period of up to six to nine months following the completion of the strategic restructuring plan 
during this period  the company would not reflect any non recurring acquisition costs in its results of operations  as all costs incurred of this nature would be related to acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method and would  therefore  be capitalized as a portion of the purchase consideration 
the company incurred restructuring costs of approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal these costs represent the external costs and liabilities to close redundant company facilities  severance costs related to the company s employees and other costs associated with the company s restructuring plans 
as discussed in introduction  the company expects to record significant additional restructuring costs in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the consolidation of its operations 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this was due primarily to a reduction in interest income during fiscal the company earned interest income on the proceeds from the issuance of an aggregate of million of the notes in may and june of the first quarter of fiscal 
these proceeds were subsequently used to fund a portion of the cash consideration used in business combinations 
interest expense has remained relatively consistent  as steadily increasing borrowings and a declining cash position have been offset by the repayment of debt from the proceeds of a stock offering in january and declining interest rates 
as a result of the completion of the strategic restructuring plan and the related financing transactions  the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates related to such debt increased significantly  as compared to april  as a result  the company expects that interest expense will increase significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting the company s business substantial leverage  ability to service debt 
other income increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal other income for fiscal of million consisted primarily of a million marketing fee  a gain on the sale of an investment and the company s share of the net income from dudley 
the company acquired its interest in dudley in november other income for fiscal of million consisted primarily of a foreign currency gain of million 
although management is pursuing additional opportunities to generate other income from arrangements with third parties that desire access to the company s distribution network and customer base  management cannot predict whether or when such opportunities will be realized  or what amount of other income might be available to the company 
provision for income taxes increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
during both fiscal years  the effective income tax rates reflect the recording of income tax provisions at the federal statutory rate of  plus applicable state and local taxes 
in addition  the effective income tax rates were increased in both periods to reflect the incurrence of non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal also reflects the incurrence of non deductible  non recurring acquisition costs offset by the effect of several business combinations in such period accounted for under the pooling of interests method  where the acquired companies were not subject to federal income taxes on a corporate level as they had elected to be treated as subchapter s corporations prior to being acquired by the company 
as a result of the completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the amount of non deductible goodwill has increased significantly and the company expects that income before income taxes will decrease 
as a result  the company expects that its effective income tax rate will be significantly higher in fiscal than it was in prior years 
income from discontinued operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  consolidated revenues increased  from  million in fiscal  to  million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal of revenues from the companies related to continuing operations that were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method during fiscal the fiscal purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition and revenues from the companies related to continuing operations that were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method during fiscal the fiscal purchased companies for the entire year 
revenues in fiscal include revenues from the fiscal purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition 
international revenues increased from million  or of consolidated revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of consolidated revenues in fiscal international revenues consisted primarily of revenues from new zealand and australia  with the balance from canada 
the increase in international revenues was primarily due to the inclusion  in the revenues for fiscal  of revenues from companies that were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method during fiscal fiscal international revenues include the results of two companies for the entire year and the results of two companies acquired in fiscal in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
gross profit increased  from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in revenue mix resulting in a higher proportion of revenues from traditionally higher margin products and services  primarily as a result of the increase in products sold in new zealand and australia and as a result of improved purchasing and rebate programs negotiated with vendors 
the company expects to continue to negotiate favorable purchasing and rebate programs with vendors 
however  the company does not believe that it will be able to continue to improve these programs at the same rates as in the past  as significant progress has already been made with vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in revenue mix resulting in a higher proportion of revenues from products and services with traditionally higher selling  general and administrative expenses  such as products sold in new zealand and australia 
amortization expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due exclusively to the increase in the number of purchase acquisitions included in the results for fiscal versus fiscal the company incurred non recurring acquisition costs of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  in conjunction with business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the non recurring acquisition costs reflect the completion of and business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the non recurring acquisition costs in fiscal included a charge of approximately million related to one business combination which included the payment of significant transaction related compensation obligations 
the company also incurred restructuring costs of approximately  and million during fiscal and  respectively 
these costs represent the external costs and liabilities to close redundant company facilities  severance costs related to the company s employees and other costs associated with the company s restructuring plans 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increase in the company s borrowings through the issuance of an aggregate of million of notes and notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal and an increase in the outstanding balance under the company s credit facility 
the proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the notes and the additional borrowings under the credit facility were used primarily to fund the cash portion of the consideration in certain business combinations accounted for under the purchase method and to refinance indebtedness assumed in business combinations 
other income increased  from  in fiscal  to million in fiscal fiscal other income consists primarily of foreign currency gains and equity in the net income of dudley 
provision for income taxes increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the low effective income tax rate in fiscal  compared to the federal statutory rate of  was primarily due to the fact that several of the companies included in the results for such year  which were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method  were not subject to federal income taxes on a corporate level as they had elected to be treated as subchapter s corporations prior to being acquired by the company 
in fiscal  this effect was offset by the increase in non deductible expenses  including amortization of goodwill and non recurring acquisition costs 
income from discontinued operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company incurred extraordinary items totaling million  which represent the aggregate expenses  net of the expected tax benefit  associated with the early termination of the company s million credit facility with first bank national association and the early termination of credit facilities at two companies acquired in transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method during fiscal liquidity and capital resources on a pro forma basis  at april   the company had working capital of million  long term debt of  million and capitalization of  million 
such pro forma amounts give effect to the strategic restructuring plan  including the financing transactions  as if such transactions had occurred on april  in june  the company completed the strategic restructuring plan 
see introduction 
the company financed the aggregate cost of purchasing shares in the equity tender  repurchasing million of its convertible subordinated notes due  and repaying its former credit facility with the proceeds of the equity investment  the net proceeds from the sale and issuance of the notes and borrowings under the credit facility 
the company also incurred significant transaction including financing costs and expenses 
see results of operations 
in connection with the completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the company incurred approximately million of additional indebtedness  and the weighted average annual interest rate on all outstanding indebtedness increased from approximately prior to completion of the strategic restructuring plan to approximately after completion of the strategic restructuring plan 
at june   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility and availability of million 
upon completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the company terminated and repaid the balance outstanding under its former million credit facility and entered into the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for an aggregate principal amount of  million  consisting of i a seven year multi draw term loan facility totaling million  ii a seven year revolving credit facility totaling million  iii a seven year term loan facility totaling million  and iv an eight year term loan facility totaling million 
in connection with the completion of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions  the company borrowed the full amount of the two single draw term loan facilities 
the multi draw facility and the revolving facility remain available for future borrowings 
interest rates on such borrowings bear interest  at the company s option  at the lending bank s base rate plus an applicable margin of up to  or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by its present domestic subsidiaries  future material domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee these obligations 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  future material domestic subsidiaries also will be required to pledge their assets as security 
the company was required to enter into arrangements to ensure that the effective interest rate paid by the company on at least of the aggregate amount outstanding under the credit facility and the notes was at a fixed rate of interest 
as a result  the company has entered into interest rate swap arrangements to limit the libor based interest rate exposure on million of the outstanding balance under the credit facility to rates ranging from to 
the interest rate swap agreements expire over a period ranging from to as a result of these swap agreements  the company has fixed the interest rates on million of the long term debt outstanding at june the credit facility includes  among others  restrictions on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  pay dividends  or engage in certain other transactions  and requirements that the company maintain certain financial ratios  and other provisions customary for loans to highly leveraged companies  including representations by the company  conditions to funding  cost and yield protections  restricted payment provisions  amendment provisions and indemnification provisions 
the credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in a variety of circumstances  including upon certain asset sales and financing transactions  and also from excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility 
the notes are also guaranteed by the company s present domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  future material domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee the notes and pledge their assets as security 
the indenture governing the notes places restrictions on the company s ability to incur indebtedness  to make certain payments  investments  loans and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of its assets to  or merge or consolidate with  another entity 
the eight year term loan facility contains negative covenants and default provisions substantially similar to those contained in the indenture governing the notes 
on a historical basis  the company s working capital was million at april  and million at april  long term debt was million at april  and million at april  the decline in working capital was due primarily to an increase in the company s borrowings under its former credit facility from million at april  to million at april  the increase in the borrowings under the former credit facility was primarily to fund the purchase price of acquisitions and to repay higher cost debt assumed in acquisitions 
in addition  in fiscal the company completed the public sale  at a gross price of per share  of approximately million shares of common stock 
the net proceeds to the company were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of the balance outstanding under the former credit facility 
during fiscal  the new zealand and australian dollars weakened against the usd 
the new zealand exchange rate declined from us 
at april  to us 
at april  the australian exchange rate declined from us 
at april  to us 
at april  this resulted in a reduction in stockholders equity  through a cumulative translation adjustment  of approximately million  reflecting the impact of the declining exchange rate on the company s investments in its new zealand and australian subsidiaries 
in addition  the devaluation has adversely affected the return on the company s investment in its new zealand and australian operations 
if the exchange rates stabilize at current rates or continue to decline  the company s return on assets and equity from its new zealand and australian operations will continue to be depressed 
subsequent to april   the new zealand and australian dollars have continued to weaken against the usd 
as of june   the new zealand dollar equaled us and the australian dollar equaled us 
see factors affecting the company s business operations outside the united states 
as a result of the company s increased indebtedness  a portion of the cash flows from the company s international operations will be required to service debt and interest payments 
the company expects that it will incur additional costs with respect to accessing cash flows from international operations including such items as new zealand and australian withholding and other taxes and foreign currency hedging costs 
subsequent to april   the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts against the new zealand dollar with an aggregate notional amount of million expiring in january through april the effect of these foreign currency forward contracts is to limit the foreign currency exposure on million of the company s net investment in its new zealand subsidiary at rates of us

fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the company s business is subject to seasonal influences 
the company s historical revenues and profitability in its core office products business have been lower in the first two quarters of its fiscal year  primarily due to the lower level of business activity in north america during the summer months 
the revenues and profitability of the company s operations in new zealand and australia and at mbe have generally been higher in the company s third quarter 
as the company s mix of businesses evolves through future acquisitions  these seasonal fluctuations may continue to change 
therefore  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results also may be affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in the prices paid by the company for the products it sells  the mix of products sold  and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies acquired by the company may differ substantially from those of the company  which could contribute to the further fluctuation in its quarterly operating results

in fiscal factors affecting the company s business a number of factors  including those discussed below  may affect the company s future operating results 
change in strategic focus and business and growth strategies 
the company was founded in october and conducted no operations prior to the acquisition of its founding companies in february since that time  the company has grown primarily through an aggressive acquisition strategy 
the company is now transitioning into a new stage of development  less reliant on acquisitions and more focused on operational efficiencies  organic growth and improved profit margins 
the company s ability to achieve these objectives will depend on a number of factors  including its generation of increased revenues and margins in existing businesses through  among other things  expansion into new markets and additional cross selling activities  ability to continue to integrate existing operations and new acquisitions without substantial delays or other problems  and achievement of operating improvements and cost reductions  such as volume purchasing arrangements  consolidation of general and administrative functions and elimination of redundant facilities  and improvement of technology and operating and distribution systems 
in particular  the company s ability to achieve operating improvements will depend on successful implementation of its plans to establish dfcs in the united states 
there can be no assurance that these efforts to achieve operating improvements will be successful or will result in anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiencies or growth in revenues and margins 
challenges of business integration 
historically  the company has grown substantially through acquisitions 
the company s aggressive acquisition program has produced a significant increase in revenues  employees  facilities and distribution systems 
while the company s decentralized management strategy  together with operating efficiencies resulting from the elimination of duplicative functions and economies of scale  may present opportunities to reduce costs  such strategies may initially require additional costs and expenditures to expand operational and financial systems and corporate management administration 
because of the various costs and possible cost savings strategies  historical operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that the pace of the company s acquisitions will not adversely affect efforts to implement cost savings and integration strategies and to manage operations and acquisitions profitably 
additionally  attempts to achieve economies of scale through cost cutting and lay offs of existing personnel may  at least in the short term  have an adverse impact upon the company 
delays in implementing planned integration and consolidation strategies  or the failure of such strategies to achieve anticipated cost savings  also could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s management and financial controls  personnel  computer systems and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage the increasing size and scope of its operations and its continuing acquisition activity 
risks related to acquisitions 
the company intends to pursue selected acquisition opportunities  however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to identify  finance and complete additional suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms  or that future acquisitions  if completed  will be successful 
the company will likely incur additional debt to finance any additional acquisitions 
certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  may restrict the company s ability to issue capital stock for a period of time after the distributions 
these limitations may restrict the company s ability to undertake transactions involving issuances of capital stock of the company that management otherwise believes would be beneficial 
see potential limitations on stock issuances 
acquired companies may not achieve future revenues and profitability levels that justify the prices that the company paid to acquire them 
acquisitions also may involve a number of risks that could have a material adverse effect on future operations and financial performance  including diversion of management s attention  unanticipated declines in revenues or profitability following acquisitions  difficulties with the retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated business problems or legal liabilities  and the amortization of acquired intangible assets  such as goodwill 
operations outside of the united states 
management also intends to continue to focus significant attention and resources on international operations and expects foreign revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of the company s total revenues 
in general  the factors described in this factors affecting the company s business section that apply to the company s domestic operations may also affect the company s foreign operations 
in addition  the company s foreign operations are subject to a number of other risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  credit risk of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions  including the possibility of hyper inflationary conditions  in certain countries 
there can be no assurance that one or a combination of these factors will not have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to maintain or increase its foreign revenues or on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
declines in the value of the new zealand and australian dollars relative to the usd have adversely affected the company s reported results 
the company cannot predict whether these currencies will  in the future  continue to decline or will increase in value relative to the usd 
for a discussion of the impact of recent declines in the value of these currencies on the company s financial condition and results of operations  see results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
substantially all of the company s indebtedness is denominated in us dollars 
as a result  declines relative to the us dollar in the value of the currencies in which the company s revenues are generated may materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and the ability of the company to meet its obligations under agreements relating to indebtedness 
substantial leverage  ability to service debt 
the company incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions 
as a result  total indebtedness at june  was approximately  million 
see liquidity and capital resources 
subject to limitations in its existing debt agreements  the company could incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the company s high leverage could have material consequences to the company  including  but not limited to  the following i the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired or any such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the company  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow will be required for debt service and  as a result  will not be available for its operations and other purposes  iii a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or an increase in expenses could make it difficult for the company to meet its debt service requirements or force it to modify its operations or sell assets  iv the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited  and v the company s level of indebtedness could make it more vulnerable to economic downturns  and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
in addition  a portion of the company s borrowings under the credit facility are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes the company to the risk of increased interest rates 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service and other obligations including compliance with financial covenants will be dependent upon the future performance of the company and its cash flows from operations  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors could include general economic conditions  operating difficulties  increased operating costs  product pricing pressures  potential revenue instability arising from cost savings initiatives or other factors  labor relations  the response of competitors or customers to the company s business strategy or projects and delays in implementation of the company s business strategy 
if the company is unable to service its indebtedness  it may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness  or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurances that the company would be able to take actions or be able to service such indebtedness 
even it additional financing could be obtained  there can be no assurance that it would be on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in addition  the pledge of substantially all of the company s assets as collateral under the credit facility could impair the company s ability to obtain financing on terms favorable to the company 
if the company were unable to repay its indebtedness to the lenders under the credit facility  such lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness  including substantially all of the company s assets  and the company could be prohibited from making any payments on the notes 
the indenture to the notes also contains a number of restrictive covenants relating to the company 
the company s management does not have experience to date operating a business with a substantial amount of leverage 
highly competitive markets 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
it generally competes with a large number of smaller  independent companies  many of which are well established in their markets 
in addition  in the united states  the naopg competes with five large office products companies  each of which may have greater financial resources than the company 
several of the company s large competitors operate in many of its geographic and product markets  and other competitors may choose to enter its geographic and product markets in the future 
in addition  as a result of this competition  the company may lose customers or have difficulty acquiring new customers 
as a result of competitive pressures in the pricing of products  the company s revenues or margins may decline 
the highly leveraged nature of the company after the transactions related to the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions could limit the company s ability to continue to make necessary or desirable investments or capital expenditures to compete effectively and to respond to market conditions 
the company faces significant competition to acquire additional businesses as the office products industry undergoes continuing consolidation 
competition is expected to increase in the domestic and international markets that the company serves or is planning to enter as consolidation occurs or accelerates in those markets 
a number of the company s major competitors are actively pursuing acquisitions on a global basis 
risks affecting mail boxes etc 
various factors may affect mbe s business 
the united parcel service ups is a key vendor for mbe 
the company estimates that a significant percentage of the gross revenues of a typical mbe retail center in the united states is attributable to services provided by ups 
if ups were to raise its prices to mbe or otherwise materially adversely change the terms on which it provides shipping services for mbe retail centers or if ups cannot provide service or provides limited services as it did during a strike by its employees  the revenues of mbe could be materially and adversely affected 
mbe conducts its business principally through franchisees or licensees  with the result that mbe has limited control over franchisee operations and is subject to significant government regulation of its legal relationships with franchisees that limits the control that mbe has over its franchisees 
mbe also faces growing competition from the united states postal service as it establishes postal service centers located in shopping centers and other locations to compete against mbe and other similar retail service centers 
ability of investor to influence management 
as part of the strategic restructuring plan  investor acquired shares  amounting to of the outstanding shares of the common stock after giving effect to the issuance of such shares 
investor also acquired various warrants that give it the right to acquire additional shares of common stock in the future that in certain circumstances could increase its ownership to as much as of the common stock if no currently outstanding stock options are exercised 
investor has  among other things  the right subject to certain conditions to nominate three of the nine members of the company s board of directors the board  including the chairman of the board 
investor will retain this right until investor s level of ownership of common stock declines by more than one third 
in addition  certain board decisions will be subject to super majority voting provisions that  in certain circumstances  may require the concurrence of at least one director nominated by investor 
the super majority voting provisions require the affirmative vote of three fourths of the board for certain decisions such as the sale of certain equity securities  any merger  tender offer involving the company s equity securities or sale  lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the company s assets or other business combination involving the company  any dissolution or partial liquidation of the company  and certain changes to the company s charter and by laws 
these super majority board voting requirements may give investor the ability to block the approval of certain actions requiring the super majority vote of the board 
in addition  investor s significant ownership of the common stock may permit investor to influence significantly matters requiring the approval of the company s stockholders 
intangible assets 
as of april   approximately million  or of the company s total assets on a pro forma basis  represented intangible assets  the substantial majority of which was goodwill 
as a result  a substantial portion of the value of the company s assets may not be available to repay creditors in the event of a bankruptcy or dissolution of the company 
as a result of the equity tender and the distributions  the company may be precluded from completing business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method for a period of up to six to nine months 
any business combinations that the company completes during this period will have to be accounted for under the purchase method 
as a result  the amount of goodwill reflected on the company s balance sheet will increase to the extent that the company acquires additional companies under the purchase method of accounting 
effect of shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of common stock 
investor holds shares of common stock representing of shares outstanding and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares plus additional shares in certain circumstances 
an investment agreement with investor restricts investor s ability to sell these shares or warrants  but when these restrictions expire or if they are waived investor may sell these shares or warrants 
additional shares may be issued either in connection with acquisitions by the company  upon exercise of outstanding options  options that may be issued in the future  and warrants  and upon maturity or exercise of other rights to acquire stock 
the sale of shares upon exercise of options or by investor  or the perception that such sales could occur  may have an adverse effect on the trading price of the common stock if a significant number of shares become available over a limited period of time 
potential liability for certain liabilities of the spin off companies 
as part of the strategic restructuring plan  the spin off companies are expected to indemnify the company for certain liabilities that the company could incur relating to the distributions  the operations of the spin off companies and other matters 
there can be no assurance that the spin off companies will be able to satisfy any such indemnities  and the company may therefore incur such liabilities even if they arose out of the activities of the spin off companies 
the company could be adversely affected if in the future the spin off companies are unable to satisfy these obligations 
in addition  the company had agreed to indemnify investor and its affiliates against losses resulting from any of the spin off companies failing to satisfy their indemnity obligations to the company 
potential liability for taxes related to the distributions 
in connection with the strategic restructuring plan  the company received an opinion of counsel that the distributions qualify as tax free spin offs under section of the code  and that the distributions are not taxable under section e of the code 
that opinion was subject to certain assumptions and limitations and is not  in any event  binding upon either the internal revenue service or any court 
if a distribution fails to qualify as a tax free spin off under section of the code  the company will recognize a gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of the spin off company s common stock on the date of the distribution and the company s adjusted tax basis in the spin off company s common stock on the date of the distribution 
in addition  each stockholder of the company will be treated as having received a taxable corporate distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value on the date of the distribution of the spin off company s common stock distributed to such stockholder 
if the company were to recognize gain on one or more distributions  such gain would likely be substantial 
if the distribution is taxable under section e  but otherwise satisfies the requirements of a tax free spin off  the company will recognize gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of the spin off company s common stock on the date of the distribution and the company s adjusted tax basis in the spin off company s common stock on the date of the distribution 
however  no gain or loss will be recognized by holders of common stock except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares 
if the company were to recognize gain on one or more distributions  such gain would likely be substantial 
potential limitations on stock issuances 
certain limitations under section of the code may restrict the company s ability to issue capital stock after the distributions 
these limitations will generally prevent the company from issuing capital stock to the extent the issuance is part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes one or more of the distributions and pursuant to which one or more persons acquire capital stock of the company that represents or more of the voting power or or more of the value of the company s capital stock 
these limitations may restrict the company s ability to undertake transactions involving issuances of capital stock of the company that management otherwise believes would be beneficial 
year compliance 
the company is currently continuing to review the year compliance of software that it uses in its business 
the company s trinity system  which it is currently installing throughout its naopg operations as the core operations system  is year compliant 
however  the company s operating subsidiaries are  in some cases  using billing or other software that is not yet year compliant 
based upon information that the company has collected from its operating subsidiaries  it expects to be able to achieve year compliance in and does not expect that the cost of making necessary adaptations will be material to the company 
if the company cannot make the necessary adaptations on a timely basis  or if the costs are greater than expected  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the company also is surveying major vendors and third party service providers to ensure that their systems are or will be year compliant 
the company is not presently aware of any material problems in the year compliance plans of its major vendors or service providers
