compared to sales 
sales in were million  an increase of over the million recorded during product sales in increased million or to million compared to million in the dollar increase was primarily the result of increased shipments of slas in both the us and europe 
the company sold a total of sla systems and a total of actua systems in in  the company sold slas and actua s 
orders for the company s systems in compared to increased in both europe and asia pacific but declined in the us market and total systems backlog at the end of was lower than the end of the company believes that the decline in the us orders in when compared to was due primarily to the inefficiencies caused by the recent changes in the domestic sales organization from a strategy of utilizing independent sales representatives primarily in the machine tool industry to a direct sales force 
the company completed its staffing of its domestic sales organization during the second half of while historically there has not always been an accurate correlation between orders and ending backlog in one year and revenues in the next year  the decline in us orders in  coupled with potential inefficiencies caused by the recent changes in the company s domestic sales organization  could negatively impact domestic revenues during the first half of the company anticipates that total orders should increase in as compared to primarily as a result of an increased sales force and the assimilation of the eos acquisition 
however  this is a forward looking statement and as with other such statements are subject to uncertainties 
as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other market conditions  total orders may page not increase in the company believes that system sales may also fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of other factors  including the status of world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of product shipments 
due to the high price of certain systems  the acceleration or delay of a small number of shipments from one quarter to another can significantly affect the results of operations for the quarters involved 
service sales in increased million  or  compared to  primarily as a result of increased maintenance revenues due to the larger installed base of sla systems in the us and europe 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of sales in compared to million or of sales in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased to in compared to in the increase in was primarily the result of greater discounting of system sales in due to competition  the sales mix of the company s products as well as the channels and markets in which the company distributes its products 
in addition  the company recorded inventory adjustments totaling approximately million  or percentage points of the increase  that were primarily associated with the transition to our new generation of products announced in the third quarter of  the eos acquisition and filed service inventories 
product pricing will continue to be a function of competitive pressures and the company will continue to experience fluctuations due to the mix of product  channel and markets 
nonetheless  the company does not currently anticipate that it will be required to recognize any material inventory adjustments during the current fiscal year  and thus expects that product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales for should improve from this is  of course  a forward looking statement  and as such is subject to risks and uncertainties 
for example  if the new products introduced last year are not commercially successful  the company may be required to record inventory adjustments  and the consequences of competitive pricing issues can never be accurately predicted 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased to in compared to in  primarily as a result of certain hardware upgrades afforded sla customers with software maintenance contracts due to the company s new nt version system software  increased parts costs under the company s field maintenance contracts and the effect of certain inefficiencies attributable to the company s keltool operations which were acquired in september selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased million or in compared to  primarily as a result of approximately million of non recurring expenses for severance benefits and other costs related to restructuring plans designed to reduce costs and improve operating results and the the expanded sales and marketing program in europe and the us research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses in increased approximately million of compared to the increase in r d expenses in was primarily the result of the write off during the third quarter of of acquired in process technology valued at approximately  in connection with the eos acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and increased personnel costs and experimental material related to certain development projects 
based on the company s historical expenditures related to research and development and its current development goals  the company anticipates for the foreseeable future  research and development expenses will be approximately ten percent of sales 
however  this is a forward looking statement and  as with any such statement  is subject to uncertainties 
for example if total sales of the company for any particular period do not meet the anticipated sales of the company for that period  research and development expenses as a percentage of sales may exceed the percent level 
operating income loss 
operating loss in was of total sales compared to operating income of of total sales in the decrease in percentage of operating income to total sales in was primarily attributable to increases in cost of sales both products and services in and the increased s  g a and r d expenses  as described above 
other income and expenses 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the lower investment balances due to cash used for operating activities and investment activities partially offset by interest income from lease receivables 
interest expense increased to  in from  in primarily as a result of the company s financing of its colorado facility which was effected august  provision for income taxes benefits 
for the company s tax benefit was million or of pre tax income loss  compared to a tax expense of million in page compared to sales 
sales in were million  an increase of over the million recorded during product sales in increased million or to million compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased shipments of slas in both the u 
s and europe 
the company sold a total of sla systems in  comprised of sla s  sla s  sla s the company s newest sla system which features the new zephyr tm recoater  a solid state laser and an automatic resin re filling system and sla s the company s largest and highest priced system 
in  the company sold slas  comprised of sla s  sla s and sla s 
orders for the company s sla systems in compared to increased in europe but declined in both the us and asia pacific markets and total sla systems backlog at the end of was lower than the end of the company believes that the decline in the us orders in when compared to was due primarily to the performance  and termination  of a number of the company s independent domestic sales representatives agents  and  to a lesser extent  to competitive pressures 
the company s domestic marketing strategy has focused on a strong internal sales organization  as well as the utilization of agents primarily  independent sales representatives in the machine tools industry 
during  these sales agents however were not producing the level of sales expected by the company 
additionally  the company believed it could obtain better visibility and contact with its customers by utilizing a direct sales force 
accordingly  in august  the company terminated its arrangements with all of its sales agents and began recruiting additional personnel to strengthen its internal sales and support organization 
between september  and december   the company completed the hiring of ten additional sales persons 
although the company offered its agents the opportunity to enter into new arrangements with the company  at lower commission rates than under the prior agreements  to date no agents have entered into new agreements 
because of the long cycle for sla systems sales  the company does not anticipate that these additions to its internal sales organization will significantly increase domestic sales in the first half of while historically there has not always been an accurate correlation between orders and ending backlog in one year and revenues in the next year  the decline in us orders in  coupled with potential inefficiencies caused by the recent changes in the company s domestic sales organization  could negatively impact domestic revenues during the first half of the company anticipates that european orders should increase in as compared to primarily as a result of an increased sales force 
however  this is a forward looking statement and as with other such statements are subject to uncertainties 
as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other market conditions  european orders may not increase in the company believes that sla system sales may also fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of other factors  including the status of world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of product shipments the current us list price of an sla  for example  is  thus the acceleration or delay of a small number of shipments from one quarter to another can significantly affect the results of operations for the quarters involved 
during  there are several additional factors which may impact quarterly sales 
during  the company introduced two new products  the sla series  a new  advanced sla system and the low priced actua office modeler which uses a technology completely different from stereolithography  designed for operation in engineering and design offices 
during may  the company began commercial shipments of the sla as a result of certain technical issues  which the company believes to be resolved  commercial shipments of the company s actua were delayed until late december  the company shipped a total of six commercial units in december 
the possibility exists that the announcement and introduction of these new products may have caused  and may cause in the future  potential customers of the company who were considering the purchase of one of the company s other models to defer their purchase decision until further information is available as to the performance and reliability of the new products 
further delays in shipments of new products may also occur as a result of unexpected problems encountered in actual use 
service sales in increased million  or  compared to  primarily as a result of increased maintenance revenues due to the larger installed base of sla systems in the us and europe as well as from greater sales approximately  of sla upgrades primarily zephyr upgrades to existing sla customers 
the company anticipates that sales of zephyr upgrades in will be significantly lower compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of sales in compared to million or of sales in page product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased to in compared to in the increase in was primarily the result of the stronger dollar in  as compared to  greater discounting of european sla system sales in due to competition  and increased manufacturing expenses as a result of the company s new and larger manufacturing facility in grand junction  colorado 
the company s gross profit margins on product sales are affected by several factors including  among others  sales mix  distribution channels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and  therefore  may vary in future periods from those experienced during additionally  the company anticipates that the gross margins related to the actua system will be lower than margins on its sla systems  and  if revenues from the sales of actua represent a material portion of the company s product sales  gross margins from product sales would be reduced 
the company also anticipates that gross margins related to the actua will be lower during the initial phases of production as a result of certain inefficiencies and anticipates  in the event of increased production  that actua gross margins could increase as a result of lower per unit material costs due to greater purchasing economies and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
additionally  the company anticipates that gross margins relating to the sla may be lower than historical margins due to the introduction in january of the sla series a an entry level sla priced at  with a lower profit margin than other sla systems and the approximately price reduction of the sla series and series effected by the company in january service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased to in compared to in  primarily as a result of lower margins from the company s us technology center due to the technology center s testing of both new hardware and software products as well as the increased use of outside vendors for certain rapid prototyping applications in the decreased margins from the us technology centers were partially offset  however  by improved margins from field service operations due to the more profitable zephyr upgrades delivered in compared to those upgrades offered in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased million or in compared to  primarily as a result of expanded sales and marketing programs in both europe and the us the company currently anticipates that s  g a expenses will be higher in compared to due primarily to the expansion of the company s us direct sales distribution channel 
the company currently anticipates that if its revenues continue to grow  s  g a expenses as a percentage of total sales in future quarters should begin to decline  primarily as a result of economies of scale 
however  these are forward looking statements and as with other such statements are subject to uncertainties 
for example  if sales do not continue to grow over the period  it is less likely that s  g a expenses as a percentage of total sales would decline 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses in increased approximately million or compared to the increase in r d expenses in was primarily the result of the write off during the third quarter of of acquired in process technology valued at  in connection with the keltool acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the company s efforts towards the development of the actua and certain other development projects 
based on the company s historical expenditures related to research and development and its current development goals  the company anticipates for the foreseeable future  research and development expenses will be equal to approximately ten percent of sales 
however  this is a forward looking statements and  as with any such statement  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  if total sales of the company for any particular period do not meet the anticipated sales of the company for that period  research and development expenses as a percentage of sales may exceed

for information with respect to allocation of sales among the company s foreign operations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cost of sales of the company s foreign operations has been significantly higher than domestic costs of sales  primarily due to the structure of transfer pricing by the company to its foreign subsidiaries  which are above the company s cost 
operating results of foreign operations have been substantially lower than domestic operating results due to the structure of transfer pricing  discussed above  the company s determination to utilize other advantageous tax planning strategies  and  to a lesser extent  the inefficiencies of size inherent in maintaining four separate operations one each in england  france  germany and italy 
to date  the company has not entered into hedging transactions to protect against changes in foreign currency exchange rates
