revenues generated by the current portfolio of properties in place during both periods increased million or compared to the prior year 
the million increase in revenue for the year ended august  compared to the year ended august  was due primarily to increased lease up of the dallas  tx property which began leasing activity during the fourth quarter of the year ended august  other factors include additional lease up at properties located in bakersfield  ca and philadelphia  pa 
these increases were offset by loss of revenue from the seekonk  ma property as a result of the bankruptcy of the anchor tenant  bradlees during the past year as well as the write off of related receivables associated with bradlees

additional increases are attributed to severance expense for executive officers that left the company during the year for which no comparable expense was recorded in the prior year 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in expense  compared to the prior year  of million related to the settlement of a litigation matter 
the increase in expenses for the year ended august  compared to the year ended august  was due primarily to the establishment of a reserve of million for a potential settlement payment pursuant to a tentative agreement regarding a litigation matter 
insurance and legal expenses also increased 
provision for asset impairments for the current portfolio of investment properties  no such indicators of impairment were present in the four months ended december  and in the years ended august   and  noncash charges of million  million and million  respectively  were taken to write down the carrying value of real properties which were being held for sale and which were expected to generate net sales proceeds below their then current book values 
interest income net percent amount change change four months ended december  four months ended december  unaudited year ended august  year ended august   year ended august  the decrease in net interest income for the four months ended december  compared to the four months ended december  was due to repayment of a million note receivable and transfer of certain other notes receivable to pricesmart in the distribution 
the increase in net interest income for the year ended august  compared to the year ended august  was due primarily to higher interest income on invested cash balances as well as a reduction in interest expense related to a million note payable to costco that was repaid during the fourth quarter of the year ended august  this net improvement was somewhat offset by reductions in interest income from notes receivable repaid during the third quarter and a reduction in capitalized interest due to less construction activity in the year ended august  the increase in net interest income for the year ended august  compared to the year ended august  was due primarily to increased income from various notes receivable  increased earnings on cash balances as well as reduced interest expense on borrowings  including a note payable to costco  which was repaid during the fourth quarter of the year ended august  gain loss on sale of real estate percent amount change change four months ended december  four months ended december  unaudited year ended august  year ended august  year ended august there were no property sales in the four months ended december  during the same period of the prior year  the gain recognized related to the sale of properties in schaumburg  il  colton  ca  and concord  ca

discontinued operations percent amount change change four months ended december  four months ended december  unaudited year ended august   year ended august   year ended august  due to the distribution of pricesmart at august   there were no discontinued operations during the four months ended december  the decrease in the net loss from operations of the discontinued merchandising segment for the year ended august  compared to the year ended august   was primarily a result of decreased expenses upon the expiration of certain contractual obligations to pay costco million per year for marketing related activities  as well as increases in sales and gross margin due to the opening of the panama city location in october and increases in sales of us sourced products to licensees 
the discontinued merchandising segment was transferred to pricesmart in the distribution 
the decrease in the net loss from operations of the discontinued merchandising segment during the year ended august  compared to the year ended august  was primarily a result of cost savings realized by discontinuing display samples and in store staffing at costco locations related to the electronic shopping program  and a reduction of central office staffing 
in addition  other revenues increased primarily as a result of royalties from the newly established licensee operations as well as certain fees for license arrangements 
adjusted funds from operations four months ended december year ended august unaudited s income before provision for income taxes      depreciation and amortization      provision for asset impairments    gain loss on sale of real estate  net   gain loss on sale of investment funds from operations      straight line rents     adjusted funds from operations      weighted average shares outstanding      real estate industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo to be a supplemental measure of performance for real estate oriented companies 
in general  ffo adjusts net income for noncash charges such as depreciation  amortization and most non recurring gains and losses 
as defined by the national association for real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo is net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  and gains losses from sales of property 
the company has historically excluded provisions for asset impairment and gains losses from sale of investment in determining ffo 
in addition  due to the significance of straight line rent accruals  which represent noncash revenues associated with fixed future minimum rent increases  the company has adjusted the nareit definition to eliminate straight line rents when computing its adjusted ffo 
ffo and adjusted ffo do not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the following table illustrates the changes in adjusted ffo for the four months ended december  and four months ended december percent change change existing portfolio noi   noi from properties transferred to pricesmart or sold general and administrative expenses   interest income   adjusted funds from operations   net operating income noi is defined as rental revenues excluding straight line rent accruals  less operating expenses before depreciation 
although noi from the current portfolio of properties increased by  the company experienced a decrease in adjusted ffo for the four months ended december  compared to the four months ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in net interest income due to the repayment of a million note receivable and the transfer of certain other notes receivable to pricesmart in the distribution 
the decrease in adjusted ffo was partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses  primarily due to the reduction in executive management and related payroll and benefits 
a further reduction to adjusted ffo compared to the prior year was the loss of noi from properties transferred to pricesmart in the distribution or sold prior to august  for the years ended august  and  the growth in adjusted ffo reflects many of the factors mentioned in the rental revenue and operating income discussion under rental operations in this item liquidity and capital resources as of december  the company had million in cash 
while the company is well positioned to finance its business activities through a variety of sources  it expects to satisfy short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations 
to the extent that investment opportunities exceed available cash flow from operations  the company believes that its unleveraged balance sheet will enable it to raise additional capital through bank credit facilities and or securitized debt offerings 
the company also may choose to seek additional funds through future public offerings of debt or equity securities 
consistent with historical trends  operating income from real estate activities increases as properties are developed and declines as properties are sold 
the company s liquidity is primarily affected by the timing and magnitude of rental property acquisition  development and disposition 
in addition  the company s liquidity may be affected by the anticipated payment of quarterly cash dividends to stockholders in the future 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
on december   the company acquired stanford ranch crossing  a power center in roseville  california  for million 
the company paid million of the purchase price on december  and is obligated to pay the remaining portion upon completion of construction in through calendar  the company anticipates investing approximately million in commercial real estate development on owned property a portion of which represents commitments under executed construction contracts and approximately million million for real estate acquisitions and development opportunities 
actual capital expenditures may vary from estimated amounts depending on business conditions and other risks and uncertainties to which the company and its business are subject 
the company is also currently in negotiations to purchase additional commercial properties as well as evaluating various properties for acquisition 
it is anticipated that any completed acquisitions will be funded by a portion of the company s existing cash balances with the remainder  if needed  provided by proceeds from an advance under an unsecured revolving credit facility the company is currently negotiating with a major institution 
year the company is in the process of upgrading its existing computer software and information technology and recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date are a known risk 
the project cost is approximately  and is expected to be completed not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on the company s operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
inflation because a substantial number of the company s leases contain provisions for rent increases based on changes in various consumer price indices  based on fixed rate increases  or based on percentage rent if tenant sales exceed certain base amounts  inflation is not expected to have a material impact on future net income or cash flow from developed and operating properties 
in addition  substantially all leases are triple net  whereby specific operating expenses and property taxes are passed through to the tenant 
for undeveloped or under developed properties  inflation could increase the company s cost of carrying and developing the properties  however  inflation would likely increase the future sales value of the properties
