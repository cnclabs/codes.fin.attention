item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview snyder oil corporation the company is engaged in the production  development  acquisition and exploration of domestic oil and gas properties  primarily in the gulf of mexico  the rocky mountains and northern louisiana 
the company also has investments in two international exploration and production companies  soco international plc soci plc and cairn energy plc cairn  both listed on the london stock exchange 
during  the company consummated several transactions to simplify its operating and capital structure 
the company exchanged its international operational holdings for stock in soci plc  which simultaneously completed an initial public offering of its stock on the london stock exchange to raise capital to fund its ongoing exploration and development efforts 
this transaction effectively replaced the company s equity investments in various international ventures with one marketable security 
the company issued million in ten year  subordinated debt and used the proceeds to redeem the outstanding convertible subordinated debt and to pay down its revolving credit facility 
these transactions provided the capacity for the company to enter into a large acquisition from existing credit sources  extended the maturity of subordinated debt at an attractive rate for the next ten years and eliminated the potential dilution of common shareholders from the convertible subordinated debt 
the company sold its interest in patina oil and gas corporation patina for approximately million in cash and the elimination of approximately million in debt 
this transaction provided cash and additional acquisition capacity while simplifying the capital structure of the company 
patina was restricted by its debt covenants from paying dividends to its shareholders  thus the company did not directly benefit from the cash flow of patina 
the company issued  common shares in exchange for million outstanding warrants  which also reduced the potential dilution of the common shareholders of the company 
the company called its preferred stock for redemption with converting to common million shares issued and the remainder being redeemed for million of cash 
this transaction eliminated million shares of additional potential dilution to the common shareholders of the company and over million per year in dividend payments 
the aforementioned transactions simplified the company s capital structure and  together with the sale of nonstrategic assets during and  positioned the company to focus on its core growth areas with all future increases in value going to the common shareholders of the company

the following table sets forth certain operating information of the company for the periods presented 
excluding patina consolidated increase increase decrease decrease oil and gas sales in thousands     production margin in thousands     daily production oil bbls     gas mcf     equivalent barrels boe     average prices oil bbl gas mcf equivalent barrel boe dd a per boe oil and gas sales  excluding patina  increased due to a significant increase in gas production along with higher gas prices 
production in the gulf of mexico more than doubled due to two fourth quarter acquisitions and the company s drilling efforts beginning to come on stream 
the rocky mountain region also increased production due to successful development drilling primarily in the second and third quarters of  but the increase was partially offset by sales of nonstrategic properties during the company expects increasing production from exploratory and development drilling during and to largely replace patina s production contribution by the end of the largest contributor to increased production in is expected to be the commencement of production from the ingrid field in the gulf of mexico by april production margin oil and gas sales less direct operating expenses for  excluding patina  increased compared to as direct operating expenses decreased in spite of the significant increase in production 
this is primarily due to the sale of noncore properties which had high operating costs  increased production in the gulf of mexico which has much lower operating costs per boe produced  and an increased emphasis on operating efficiencies 
operating costs per boe  excluding patina  were compared to in gains on sales of properties of million in and million in were a result of the company s ongoing plan to divest of nonstrategic assets 
the most significant items in were the sales of two noncore properties in the gulf of mexico for a million gain 
the most significant item during was a million gain on the sale of a interest in the green river basin holdings 
general and administrative expenses  net of reimbursements  for were million  a million increase compared to as several of the properties sold during  while having high operating costs and depletion  depreciation and amortization rates  provided significant general and administrative expense reimbursements 
net general and administrative costs have declined three to six percent each quarter since the fourth quarter of there was a decrease in the fourth quarter of attributable to the disposition of patina 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in  million of which was incurred by patina 
in  interest expense  net of interest income  was million  million of which was incurred by patina 
the majority of the increase was the result of higher average interest rates  as subordinated notes represented a higher percentage of total debt 
interest income in was million compared to  in as the company had a higher average cash balance  particularly in the fourth quarter of  due to the proceeds from the disposition of patina 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million to million in spite of higher production levels 
the decrease is primarily due to higher amortization costs on a noncompete agreement at patina  but was also the result of lower production depletion  depreciation and amortization rates 
production depletion  depreciation and amortization per boe  excluding patina  was in compared to in the lower rates were the result of upward revisions in reserve quantities at year end primarily in proved undeveloped reserves which became economic at year end prices 
property impairments in included a million impairment recorded on the uinta field 
at the end of  uinta prices benefited from a tight local oil supply and very high rocky mountain area oil prices 
since then  new supplies have depressed the oil market and prices in the area have returned to more normal levels 
additionally  a million impairment was recorded on a gulf of mexico oil well after it did not respond to workover attempts 
comparison of results to total revenues for were million  a million increase from the increase was in large part due to a million increase in gains on sales of investments which was primarily due to a million gain recognized in the fourth quarter related to an exchange of the company s stock held in command for stock in cairn 
an increase in oil and gas sales of million was also experienced in as a result of a rise in the price received per boe while production remained relatively stable compared to natural gas prices rebounded in to per mcf from per mcf in  a increase 
oil prices improved to average per barrel during partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in gas transportation  processing and marketing revenues of million primarily as a result of the sale of the company s wattenberg gas facilities in net income for was million  compared to a net loss in of million 
the income was boosted by the net effect of the command transaction million after minority interest expense and deferred tax expense 
however  the company also recorded a noncash charge of million in the second quarter related to the contribution of the company s wattenberg oil and gas properties to a newly formed public company  patina  in return for a stake in patina 
the loss was primarily due to million in noncash property impairment charges and almost million in combined losses resulting from a litigation settlement  losses on marketable securities  as well as severance and restructuring costs 
absent these special non recurring items  there was an increase in net income from to of approximately million 
this increase can be attributed primarily to the increase in average price received per boe which increased revenues million offset partially by a decrease in gas management margin of million and an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million 
revenues from production operations  less direct operating expenses  for were million  an increase of from net revenue 
average daily production during was  boe  almost exactly what it was in  boe 
however  the average product price received increased by to per boe 
production remained relatively constant from to which can be attributed to additional interests acquired in four gulf of mexico acquisitions in late and during and the properties acquired in the patina transaction offset by decreased production related to numerous sales of noncore properties in and and the reduction of development drilling 
total operating expenses for decreased by million in line with the company s efforts of divesting of marginal properties with high operating costs and acquiring incremental interests in offshore properties which have historically had lower operating costs per boe 
operating costs per boe were compared to in direct operating margin from gas transportation  processing and marketing for was million compared to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in processing margins due to the sale of the company s wattenberg gas processing facilities which was completed in the third quarter of the company realized almost million in sales proceeds during on these facilities and recognized a total of million in gains 
gains on sales of investments were million in  compared to million in the million gain on the command exchange accounted for the bulk of the increase 
the remaining gains are primarily due to sales of a portion of the company s interests in russia and mongolia 
in january  the company s interest in mongolia was further reduced 
gains on sales of properties were million in  compared to million in the most significant gain during was a million gain on the sale of a interest in the green river basin holdings for million 
the most significant gain during was the million gain recognized as part of the sale of the company s wattenberg gas processing facilities for almost million 
other income  net of other expense  increased million from the increase can be primarily attributed to equity in earnings of command increasing million from the equity in losses recorded in exploration expenses for were million  down million from the decrease was due primarily to a writeoff of million of acreage costs in that was not incurred in included in the expenditures of million was a million dry hole drilled in the gulf of mexico in the third quarter on an unexplored block adjacent to one of the company s current producing blocks 
general and administrative expenses  net of reimbursements  for were million as compared to million in the slight decrease is the result of ongoing expense reduction efforts and reductions in personnel due to the property divestitures that have taken place over the past two years offset somewhat by increased expenses related to the patina transaction 
net financing costs were million compared to million in the majority of the increase is the result of a higher average interest rate primarily due to patina s subordinated notes which have an effective interest rate of 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense in increased to million from million in the increase reflects an increase in the overall depletion  depreciation and amortization rate per equivalent barrel from to 
this increase can be attributed to downward revisions in reserve quantities at year end primarily in proved undeveloped reserves which became uneconomic at year end prices and the growing impact of the gulf of mexico operations which are typically more capital intensive thus having a higher depletion rate 
acquisition  exploration and development during  the company  excluding patina incurred million in capital expenditures  including million for development  million for exploration  million for property acquisitions  million for field and office equipment and  for gas facility expansion

financial condition and capital resources during  net cash provided by operations was million  an increase of compared to as of december   commitments for capital expenditures totaled million 
the company anticipates that expenditures for exploration and development will approximate to million 
the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities and market conditions

the costs associated with final compliance are not considered material 
the company believes that its capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of its business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and gas prices  and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
inflation and changes in prices while certain of the company s costs are affected by the general level of inflation  factors unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations 
over the past five years  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and gas prices 
in addition  changing prices often cause costs of equipment and supplies to vary as industry activity levels increase and decrease to reflect perceptions of future price levels 
although it is difficult to estimate future prices of oil and gas  price fluctuations have had  and will continue to have  a material effect on the company 
the following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and highlights the price fluctuations by quarter for and average gas prices for and were increased by 
and
