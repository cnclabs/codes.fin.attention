ffo and fad in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs
