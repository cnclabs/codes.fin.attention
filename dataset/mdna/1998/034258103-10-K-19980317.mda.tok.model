item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition general 
the company s results of operations depend to a great extent on the banks net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on their loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid on their deposits and borrowed funds  the size of the provisions for loan losses and losses on real estate operations and operating expenses 
net interest income is primarily affected by the level of earning assets as a percentage of total assets  the level of interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
earnings are also affected by non interest income which consists primarily of mortgage banking income  transaction account fees  gains and losses on sales of the investment portfolio and real estate operations 
the levels of operating expenses and income taxes also affect earnings 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated results of operations for the last three years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal and this section is intended to be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the following also contains forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations andover generated net income of million or per diluted share  million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share in  and  respectively 
andover s return on average assets decreased slightly in to  as compared to in and in return on average stockholders equity decreased slightly in to  as compared to in and in the company s financial performance in was impacted by an increase in total earning assets as well as the net yield on those assets 
the financial performance in was positively impacted by a one time gain in the form of a tax benefit of million and a pre tax credit of  for the execution of a merger termination agreement  partially offset by a pre tax loss of million from the sale of low yielding investments and the early extinguishment of debt 
the financial performance in was negatively impacted by a pre tax charge to earnings of million taken in connection with the failed acquisition of finest financial corp  the parent company of pelham bank and trust company 
net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income was million in  up from million in and million in net interest income increased million during and million during as a result of higher average earning asset volumes in both of those years 
market interest rates have been fairly volatile over the past several years 
during  the interest rate margin of and the interest rate spread of were favorably impacted by the restructure of the balance sheet undertaken in the latter part of this restructure enabled the company to recognize a basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets while maintaining only a basis point increase on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the impact of the growth in interest earning assets during was partially muted by continued contractions in the interest rate spread 
this contraction is primarily the result of increased rates paid on deposits and totalled in the yield on interest earning assets increased basis points in to while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities experienced an increase of basis points to 
since average earning assets rose faster than average interest bearing liabilities  the net yield increased basis points in to 
the amount of foregone interest income from nonaccruing and restructured loans totalled  in   in and million in average earning assets increased in to  million as of december   and increased during to  million 
the increase in each of the two years was primarily due to higher loan growth resulting from increased loan originations and purchases 
total average loans increased million during and million during primarily due to retained loan originations and whole loan purchases 
the yield on real estate loans increased basis points during to while decreasing basis points in to 
the yield on consumer loans decreased basis points during to while decreasing basis points during to 
the main reason for the decline during is due to the highly competitive environment for home equity loans  causing the banks to offer lower interest rates on this product  while the decline in was primarily due to decreases in the prime lending rate 
the yield on commercial loans decreased basis points during to and basis points during to 
the decline in the commercial loan yield during was primarily due to competitive pricing as well as a higher proportion of fixed rate loans 
the yield in decreased due to the decrease in the prime lending rate while the commercial loan yields were favorably impacted by a reduction in nonaccrual loans and higher amortized fee income during the volatility in the interest rates has also impacted the yields earned on the investment portfolio 
the yield on short term investments increased basis points during to and decreased basis points in to 
the yields earned on investment securities increased basis points to in while decreasing in to 
the yield on mortgage backed securities increased basis point during to and increased basis points in to 
the increase in the federal funds rate of basis points and decrease of basis points during impacted the short term investment yield in a corresponding manner 
the increase in the yield on the investment securities is primarily due to the balance sheet restructure  whereby lower yielding securities were sold at a loss and the proceeds from such sale were reinvested at a higher market interest rate 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased basis points in to and basis points in to 
core deposits  which include now  savings and money market accounts  usually have rates lower than those paid on certificates of deposit 
however  to grow the core deposit balances  the banks have offered promotional rates on certain products 
the impact of these promotional rates on the savings rate has been an increase of basis points in and basis points in average balances  meanwhile  have grown by million and million  respectively  in and the banks have moderated the increase in the rates paid on money market accounts and had an increase in the rate paid of only basis points and basis points  respectively  in and however  the balances maintained in money market accounts have declined in each of those years as customers have migrated to the regular savings account 
the balances maintained in now accounts have increased modestly in both years while the rates have remained fairly stable during that same time period 
certificate of deposit average balances increased million and the rates paid increased basis points during  while also increasing million and basis points  respectively  in the company has continued its reliance on borrowed funds as an alternative source of funds to deposits in order to grow average earning assets 
during  the company was successful in attracting new deposits  therefore  the average balance on borrowed funds decreased million and the rate paid decreased basis points to 
in  average balances increased million and the rate paid decreased basis points to 
the decline in the rate paid in both years was partly attributable to the early extinguishment of million of borrowed funds in the third quarter of although the net yield on earning assets increased slightly during  primarily due to the balance sheet restructuring undertaken in  overall  a continued compression has been experienced in the margins over the past two years which has led to an interest rate spread of in  up modestly from in the decline in the spread in totalled basis points

rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the changes in interest income and interest expense caused by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in interest rates received and paid  respectively 
the change attributable to a mix of volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to the statement of operations 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated losses in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors management may consider are the quality of specific loans  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  the level of nonaccruing loans  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and collateral values of the underlying security 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates and future additions may be necessary 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  review the banks allowance and may require the banks to provide additions to the allowance based on their assessment  which may differ from management s assessment 
the provision for loan losses in  and was  million and million  respectively 
net charge offs amounted to  in compared to million in both and the decline in the provision in reflects  among other things  a reduction in non performing assets and reduced levels of delinquencies  combined with high levels of recoveries 
partially offsetting the reasons for the decline  however  was loan growth of realized during the increased provision in was due to loan growth of and the deterioration of a previously reported problem loan resulting in a charge off of  among the factors used to determine that a provision was necessary in were the level of nonaccrual and restructured loans  delinquencies and charge offs and loan growth of over 
while management believes that it has been reasonable in its analysis of the allowance for loan losses and in estimating the net fair values of other real estate owned  management is unable to predict the ultimate course of the economy or the extent of its impact on the company s financial condition 
see financial condition risk elements and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest income 
the company recorded income from non interest sources of million in  million in and million in the increase of million in was primarily due to a reduction in the losses on real estate operations  higher fee income on deposits and an increase in the gains generated by the investment portfolio 
the decrease of  in was primarily due to losses generated by the investment portfolio as part of the balance sheet restructuring 
net gains from sales and redemptions of investments totalled  in and  in  as compared to net losses on sales and redemptions of  in the loss on sale of investments in was primarily due to the balance sheet restructuring whereby the company sold approximately million of low yielding investments at a loss of  in the third quarter and reinvested the proceeds in higher yielding assets 
see financial condition investments and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded net gains from sales of assets held for sale of  in   in and  in included in the net gains for and were gains totalling  and  respectively  from the adoption of new accounting rules on originated mortgage servicing rights 
additionally  gains resulting from the old accounting rules on the capitalization of excess mortgage servicing fees totalled  and  respectively  for the years ending december  and see financial condition loans and notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
andover may incur gains and losses on the sale of the loans that it originates 
these loans are generally securitized prior to sale in the form of mortgage backed securities which are guaranteed by a government agency and are then held for sale 
because loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or market value and mortgage backed securities held for sale are stated at fair value  periods of rising interest rates cause the values of loans and mortgage backed securities held for sale to decrease  resulting in a charge to income 
the company frequently enters into forward delivery contracts to reduce exposure to this risk from rising interest rates 
forward delivery contracts may  however  increase exposure to the risk from declining interest rates if sufficient loans or mortgage backed securities held for sale bearing interest rates specified by the contracts are not available to meet the delivery schedules under the contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage banking income represents the gross servicing fee income less amortization and provisions for the valuation allowance of the mortgage servicing assets 
the company retains as a service fee a portion of the interest paid by the borrower 
a valuation allowance was established in and the provisions charged against earnings totalled  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and in a low interest rate environment  the underlying residential loans will repay faster than expected  causing the fair value of the mortgage servicing assets to decline 
this prepayment risk results in increased provisions and charge offs to the valuation allowance  and thus lower mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income totalled million in  million in and million in the increased gross servicing income in each of the years was due to an increase in the total loans serviced for others 
however  in and  the amortization of the mortgage servicing assets increased correspondingly 
the net mortgage banking  or servicing  income  therefore  declined modestly during and increased  during the table below summarizes the company s results from servicing loans for investors 
years ended december  in thousands gross servicing income    amortization and provisions for valuation allowance   net mortgage banking income    average loans serviced for investors    year end loans serviced for investors    during  and  the company purchased mortgage servicing rights to million  million and million  respectively  in residential first mortgage loans 
these purchased balances are included in the balance of loans serviced for investors 
as part of its long term business plan  the company intends to continue purchasing mortgage servicing to increase the use of its existing servicing capacity and increase loan service revenue when it is deemed appropriate 
the company also expects to continue selling mortgages in the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and therefore  servicing income related to this activity is accordingly expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
losses on real estate operations totalled  in  million in and million in real estate operations consist of provisions for the valuation allowance  operating costs of maintaining other real estate owned  gains or losses on sales of properties and costs associated with the foreclosure of nonaccrual properties  less any rental income on other real estate owned 
the company accounts for other real estate owned at the lower of cost or estimated net fair value 
declines in value subsequent to foreclosure or substantive repossession result in a charge to the valuation allowance 
replenishing the valuation allowance caused by charge offs taken as a result of declines in value resulted in a charge of   and  to real estate operations in  and  respectively 
deterioration in the new england real estate market during the early s led to high levels of other real estate owned and corresponding administrative costs 
gains on sales of other real estate owned totalled  in   in and  in the costs of foreclosing on loans  as well as the administrative costs of maintaining the non performing assets  correspond with the volume of problem assets and totalled  in  million in and million in these costs will continue to be incurred until the level of non performing assets significantly decreases 
see financial condition risk elements and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income totalled million  million  and million in  and  respectively  and was derived primarily from customer service charges and fees 
deposit account service charges  representing the largest component of such other income  totalled million in  and million in both and loan late charges and other fees declined modestly during after increasing almost in over s level 
the fees recognized in reflect lower level of delinquencies while the level recognized in reflects the increase in total loans 
rental income increased during to  while declining by the same percentage in due to a vacancy in retail space owned by the company during  which became fully tenanted in during  the company recognized a loss of  on a non marketable asset while the results in reflect a gain on a non marketable security 
notwithstanding these one time events  other income has remained relatively flat over the past three years and includes income from liberty securities  ira  safe deposit and atm fees and other miscellaneous charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest expense 
non interest expenses increased million or to million in non interest expenses increased  or to million in the increases in both and are primarily due to operating a larger institution in each of the years 
this has resulted in higher staffing levels  an increased number of branches and alternative delivery systems  and growth in the number of loans and deposits 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses  increased million to million in and increased  in to million 
the increase in each of the years was primarily due to increased staffing  merit increases and increased costs associated with the various benefits programs offered by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
office occupancy and equipment increased  to million in and increased  in to million 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes  reflecting an increase in the values of company owned properties as well as an increase in service maintenance contracts on various equipment owned by the company 
the increase in was the result of increased depreciation and rental expenses resulting from a new branch facility  a full year of service in another branch facility and the opening of a remote atm 
additionally in  the company shortened its estimate of the useful life of one of its branches causing depreciation expense to increase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
data processing expenses totalled million in  million in and million in data processing expenses increased  in and  in due to a higher loan and deposit base resulting from the purchase of loans and mortgage loan servicing and internal loan and deposit growth 
in addition  the introduction of alternative delivery systems  via customers computers  debit cards and by a telephone service center  have caused overall processing costs to increase in each of the two years 
marketing expenses totalled  in   in and  in marketing expenses increased modestly in and  in due to a number of discretionary promotions for various retail products as well as continued promotions relating to the expansion of abnh  particularly during mortgage banking expenses totalled  in   in and  in costs included in mortgage banking expenses are commissions and related expenses paid to the mortgage loan originators  net of any deferred origination expenses  and costs associated with servicing the portfolio for outside investors 
these costs increased modestly in and due to higher loan origination volume as well as a larger servicing portfolio 
professional fees  including corporate legal expense and accounting and auditing expenses  totalled  in  million in and  in the decline of  in was due to a reduction in various consulting and tax planning projects 
the increase of  in was primarily due to costs incurred implementing tax planning strategies undertaken during the third quarter in the amount of  additionally  increased corporate legal fees and miscellaneous consulting contracts contributed to the increase in deposit insurance premiums were   and  in  and  respectively 
deposit insurance premiums increased  in due to an increase in the fdic assessment rates  combined with higher levels of deposits 
deposit insurance premiums decreased  in due to significantly reduced fdic assessment rates 
the banks are in the lowest risk category for calculating fdic insurance premiums 
in  the company recognized a recovery of  from the execution of a merger termination agreement while it incurred a charge of million in resulting from the same 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses totalled million in  million in and million in the increases of  in and  in are primarily due to running a larger organization 
this is reflected in more loan and deposit accounts  higher staffing levels and more branches and locations in each of the two years 
correspondingly  increases result from higher postage expenses  office supplies and printing costs as well as telephone costs and increased contributions 
besides these costs  the fee structure for the directors was increased in in addition  a  non recurring charge was incurred in with respect to an insurance related adjustment for the former chief executive officer of the bank pursuant to the terms of his retirement agreement 
federal and state income tax expense 
the company recorded tax expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of million in and decrease of million in were mainly due to a one time benefit of million as a result of a change in federal tax law in recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the provision of enacted tax laws and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates 
management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred income tax asset will reverse in periods in which the company generates net taxable income 
for the years ending december   and   the company generated taxable income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
taxable income differs from pretax book income primarily as a result of loan losses and provision for losses on other real estate owned being recognized in a different period than for book income 
the company recorded a reduction of the valuation allowance due to increased recoverable federal income taxes of  in and and  in at december   the net deferred tax asset is supported by recoverable income taxes of approximately million 
the total income tax expense has been increased to reflect the adjustment to the deferred tax assets for the tax impact of the massachusetts tax rate reduction as part of the bank tax reform law signed by the governor of massachusetts on july  management believes that the net deferred income tax asset at december  will be realized based upon the significant reduction in the level of non performing assets over the past several years 
it is management s belief that the valuation allowance is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
it should be noted  however  that factors beyond management s control  such as the general state of the economy and real estate values  can affect future levels of taxable income and that no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible temporary differences 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  to  million at december  the growth in total assets was primarily due to an increase of million in total loans as well as an increase of million in investments 
total assets at december  amounted to  million  an increase of million or from  million at december   resulting primarily from an increase in total loans of million  offset by a modest decline in the investment portfolio 
loans total loans at december   prior to the allowance for loan losses  amounted to million compared with million at december   an increase of million or  primarily due to internally generated loan growth combined with purchases of million in residential whole loans 
at december   of andover s total loan portfolio consisted of loans with adjustable rates as compared to at december  the following table shows the composition of the company s loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
the balances shown are net of unadvanced funds  loan premiums or discounts and deferred loan origination fees and costs 
at december  dollars in thousands real estate loans residential      commercial      construction and land      total real estate loans      consumer loans home improvement  second mortgage and home equity line of credit      personal      guaranteed education      collateral      total consumer loans      commercial loans      total loans      allowance for loan losses 
     net loans      total real estate loans increased million in to million at december   primarily due to the purchase of million in residential whole loans combined with stable residential and commercial real estate loan originations 
origination volumes have also been affected by the interest rate environment over the past five years and are sensitive to market rates  particularly in the refinancing arena 
as can be determined by the following table  loan originations were extremely high in  the year with the lowest interest rates 
loan originations were strong in and due to a favorable interest rate environment while loan originations dropped in due to the higher interest rates existing during most of that year 
residential loan originations totalled million in  million in and million in these originations are not fully reflected in loans outstanding due to the securitization of residential real estate loans into mortgage backed securities held for sale or available for sale of million in  million in and million in  as well as regular amortization and prepayments 
the majority of the company s residential loans are underwritten to be eligible for sale in the secondary market 
andover sells most of the eligible year fixed rate loans it originates 
a loan which the company intends to sell may be sold directly or converted into mortgage backed securities and sold in that form 
residential loans sold either directly or in the form of mortgage backed securities amounted to million in  million in and million in the portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for others totalled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the following table shows the composition of the company s loan originations and loan purchases for the years indicated years ended december  in thousands real estate loans residential fixed rate      residential variable rate      total residential originations      commercial      construction and land      total real estate loan originations      residential whole loan purchases    commercial whole loan purchases  total real estate purchases    total real estate loan originations and purchases      consumer loans home equity line of credit      other consumer      total consumer loans      commercial loans      total loan originations and purchases      outstanding commercial loans increased million in to million at december  commercial real estate loans increased million in to million at december   while construction and land loan balances decreased million to million in the same period 
while originations of corporate loans  comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans  are sensitive to the interest rate environment  the capacity for borrowing  current and anticipated economic conditions and real estate values have a more critical role 
during the declining real estate markets in the early s  commercial real estate and development loans were particularly hard hit 
origination volume for corporate loans decreased in and  corresponding with the declining real estate values and business conditions 
origination volume for these loans have increased over the past three years  reflecting stabilizing values and the company s interest in corporate lending 
however  due to the highly competitive market for these loans  the origination volume slipped slightly in but it does not represent a reduction in the company s interest or capacity for these types of loans 
total originations of corporate loans were million in  million in and million in loans transferred into real estate owned totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
commercial real estate  construction and land  and commercial loans involve significant risks compared with single family residential mortgage and consumer lending 
see item  business lending activities 
consumer loans outstanding increased  or million to million at december   from million at year end during  the company continued to aggressively price its home equity lines of credit and was able to keep originations of these loans in excess of million in both and other consumer loans include secured student loans  collateral loans and second mortgage loans 
prior to  the company had experienced a two year decline in consumer originations 
originations of consumer loans are also sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment 
risk elements the following table shows the composition of non performing assets at december dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans      other real estate owned     total non performing assets 
     total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets during  continued progress was made in reducing non performing assets with a reduction of million or primarily due to a reduction of nonaccruing loans 
of the million in nonaccruing loans at december   million are less than days past due but have exhibited some other credit weakness 
andover had experienced a sharp increase in the level of non performing assets and a corresponding rise in foregone income  loan losses and other costs associated with non performing assets beginning in due to the deteriorating new england real estate market and economy 
a significant portion of andover s non performing assets are secured by mixed use commercial and multi family real estate located in lawrence  massachusetts 
this city has been especially hard hit with declining real estate values and increasing vacancies in multi family  investor owned properties  which represents the majority of andover s collateral on troubled loans in lawrence 
continued deterioration in this market area will adversely impact the collectibility of residential and commercial real estate loans and may result in an increased level of non performing assets in at december   approximately million of nonaccruing loans and almost all of the other real estate owned were secured by properties located in lawrence 
the largest relationship included in the non performing asset balances totalled million  consisting primarily of multi family  investor owned  real estate 
the amount of accruing loans secured by properties in lawrence totalled approximately million at december  the largest multi family borrower relationships included in the accruing lawrence portfolio totalled million and million  respectively  at december  substantially all of the remaining accruing loans at year end in lawrence were secured by residential properties 
at december   total impaired loans were million  of which million had related allowances of million and million which did not require a related impairment allowance 
all of the million in impaired loans have been measured using the fair value of the collateral method 
during the period ended december   the average recorded value of impaired loans was million and the related amount of interest income recognized was see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
nonaccruing loans 
management places loans  regardless of collateral values  on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against current period interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
when collection procedures do not bring a loan to performing status  andover generally institutes action to foreclose upon the property or to acquire it by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
loans for which payments are less than days past due are placed on nonaccrual status where there exists serious doubt as to the ultimate collectibility of the loan 
the following table shows the composition of nonaccruing loans at december dollars in thousands residential real estate      commercial real estate      construction and land commercial    consumer total nonaccrual loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccruing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans during  loans on nonaccrual decreased to million  throughout all loan categories 
interest income of approximately million would have been recorded in on nonaccruing loans if those loans had been on a current basis in accordance with their original terms 
interest income actually recognized in on nonaccruing loans amounted to approximately  additionally  another  in interest payments were received on nonaccruing loans during and applied as a reduction of the loan balance instead of as interest income 
restructured loans 
a restructured loan is one for which the bank has modified the terms to provide a temporary reduction in the rate of interest below the prevailing market interest rates at the time of modification and  in most instances  an extension of payments of principal or interest or both due to the deterioration in the financial position of the borrowers 
restructured loans are not returned to performing status until the obligation has performed for a reasonable period of time  its ultimate collectibility is no longer in doubt and is at a market rate of interest 
restructured loans totalled million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rate modifications typically do not exceed one year 
the weighted average interest rate on restructured loans as of december  was 
other real estate owned 
andover s other real estate owned remained at rather high levels after rising significantly in the early s due to the deterioration in the new england real estate market and economy

the following table shows the composition of other real estate owned at december in thousands residential real estate    commercial real estate   multi family real estate    construction and land    valuation allowance  total other real estate owned     all other real estate owned is carried at the lower of the carrying value of the loan or the estimated net fair value of the property constructively or actually received 
initial writedowns to net fair value are charged to the allowance for loan losses and totalled  in   in and million in subsequent provisions for losses due to the deterioration in real estate values are charged to real estate operations and totalled  in   in and  in gains of   and  were recognized on sales of million  million and million in other real estate owned in  and  respectively 
due to the level of nonaccrual loans at december   continued foreclosures are likely to occur in resulting in continued foreclosure and related operating expenses 
the impact of existing non performing assets on future interest income will be largely dependent upon converting these assets to earning status  either through a return to performing status or through foreclosure and subsequent disposition of the property 
it is expected that the level of foreclosures and related expenses will continue to adversely impact earnings in allowance for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the activity in andover s allowance for loan losses during the five years ended december dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year      balance of acquired institution  provision   charge offs residential real estate   commercial real estate    construction and land commercial consumer total charge offs      recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate construction and land commercial consumer total recoveries   net charge offs     balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding net charge offs totalled  in  million in both and the ratio of net charge offs to average loans  however  has continued its steady decline from the levels experienced in and total only for the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to at december   from and at december  and  respectively  due to continued loan growth and to a lesser extent  the purchase of whole loans 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a periodic basis 
see results of operations provision for loan losses 
management measures the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses by assigning loans into risk categories based on a loan classification system modelled after the bank regulatory classification system 
while management believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover potential losses  there are uncertainties regarding future events 
deterioration in the real estate market or economy may result in additional nonaccruing loans  charge offs and a need for provisions for loan losses to maintain an adequate allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the banks allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the banks to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various categories of the portfolio is also made periodically  based on management s judgment in weighing various factors  including the quality of specific loans  the level of nonaccruing loans in the various categories  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and the collateral value of the underlying security 
because the allowance for loan losses is based on various estimates  including loan collectibility and real estate values  and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in the general economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the banks monitor the loan portfolio and related allowance through the use of account plans prepared for nonaccruing loans and other loans identified by management as needing closer monitoring 
the account plans are prepared for loans which have been assigned adverse credit risk ratings and have been considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses 
the largest exposure to a single borrower included in non performing loans at december   was approximately million  consisting primarily of multi family  investor owned  real estate 
the changes in the allowance allocated to each category of loan directly corresponds to the level of nonaccrual loans and adversely classified loans as well as the level of outstanding loans 
andover historically has experienced lower losses in its residential mortgage loan portfolio and  therefore  allocations applicable to this portfolio are lower

investments as of december   andover s investment portfolio totalled million  for a modest increase of from million at year end the company manages the investment portfolio in accordance with the investment policy adopted by the board of directors 
the primary objectives are to provide interest and dividend income  to ensure adequate liquidity and achieve an acceptable asset liability gap position while diversifying the asset mix 
the investment portfolio is also evaluated in comparison to returns that are earned by the loan portfolio 
in the third quarter of  approximately million of low yielding investments were sold and the proceeds from such sales were reinvested in similar securities at higher yields 
the primary component of the total investment portfolio is mortgage backed securities  which accounted for of total investments at december  the remaining portion of the total investment portfolio consists of us government and federal agency obligations  corporate bonds  short term investments in federal funds sold  and other investment grade securities 
us government and federal agency obligations represent the fastest growing component of the investment portfolio and totalled as of december   as compared to at year end all of the mortgage backed securities represent undivided interests in pools of mortgages which have been formed into pass through securities and sold to investors by the government national mortgage association gnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fnma 
securities issued by gnma  a wholly owned us government corporation  are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest 
securities issued by fhlmc and fnma  government sponsored corporations  carry each corporation s guarantee as to the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal 
cash flows from the underlying mortgages of all mortgage backed securities are passed through to andover in the form of monthly payments of interest  scheduled principal amortization  and prepayments of mortgage balances 
these securities  therefore  have unpredictable cash flows 
the approximate market value of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities included in the investment portfolio totalled million at december  the carrying amount of callable securities included in investments available for sale and investments held to maturity totalled million and million  respectively  as of december  debt securities are classified as held to maturity only when there is positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such securities are recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are debt and equity securities held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
the company does not have any securities designated as trading securities 
such securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings 
investments available for sale are any debt or equity security not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities 
investments available for sale are recorded at their fair value with changes in fair values recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of the related income taxes 
there was an increase in the unrealized gain of approximately million in the investment portfolio  from a net unrealized gain of  as of december   to million as of december   resulting from a decrease in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates and their impact on the unrealized gain or loss in the investment portfolio are not material factors in the company s overall investment strategy 
this is largely due to the fact that neither the changes nor their impact can be controlled by the company 
additionally  investment purchases are often match funded by long term advances in order to achieve a consistent spread on a particular investment

the success of this strategy is reflected in the growth in demand deposits  now accounts and regular savings accounts 
the growth in the regular savings accounts is due to the introduction of a tiered savings product 
this account offers customers a premium rate on balances in excess of  management believes the decline in the money market balances are the result of a shift to the new savings product 
in the current interest rate environment  depositors are shifting from longer maturity term deposits into core deposit accounts without fixed maturities or into shorter maturity term deposits 
the bank believes that this trend will continue into as long as interest rates remain at these fairly low rates

the bank incurred a pre tax loss of  or  net of tax  on this transaction  however  by repurchasing new advances  the bank was able to reduce the effective rate from approximately down to less than see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
asset and liability management and market risk the banks earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the company seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by andover s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the banks market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and preserve capital  while adjusting the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the following two tables reflect different methods of disclosing the company s exposure to a change in interest rates and its potential impact on the company s net interest income 
the gap analysis uses estimated prepayments  contractual maturities and next repricing dates while the market risk analysis excludes the next repricing dates 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities in both tables would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions provided 
one method used to measure the interest rate risk exposure is the company s gap analysis  which involves comparing the difference between assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during a given period of time 
these differences are a primary component of the risk to net interest income 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
the following table illustrates the company s gap position  or the estimated maturity and repricing structure of its interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  at december

fixed rate mortgage loans are shown in the table in the time period corresponding to scheduled principal amortization and anticipated prepayments using annual conditional prepayment rates that vary from at december   as compared with at december  variable rate loans  securities  certificates of deposit and borrowed funds are allocated to the period in which the rates could be next adjusted or to their final contractual maturity for the fixed rate instruments 
mortgage backed securities are allocated using annual conditional prepayment rates of at december   versus at december  other interest sensitive assets include assets held for sale and fhlb stock 
nonaccruing loans have been excluded from both the gap analysis and the market risk analysis 
a substantial portion of regular savings  money market and now accounts are considered core deposits by management and  therefore  relatively insensitive to interest rates 
in addition  any future changes to the interest rates paid on these accounts are at the sole discretion of management 
despite the foregoing factors  these deposits  included in the other deposits category  have been allocated between each time period based on the banks own historical experience  or decay rates  in determining the deposit runoff 
the other method used to measure interest rate risk is the market risk analysis 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  expected maturity date at december  fair value at thereafter total dollars in millions interest sensitive assets fixed rate securities average interest rate variable rate securities average interest rate fixed rate retail loans average interest rate variable rate retail loans average interest rate fixed rate corporate loans average interest rate variable rate corporate loans average interest rate other interest sensitive assets 
average interest rate total interest sensitive assets   interest sensitive liabilities savings money market deposit accounts average interest rate certificates of deposit average interest rate now accounts average interest rate total borrowed funds average interest rate total interest sensitive liabilities   market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for interest sensitive assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal using the same ratios used for the gap analysis presented above 
retail loans include residential and consumer loans while corporate loans are comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans 
for interest sensitive liabilities  the same decay rates and contractual maturities used for the gap analysis are used for the market risk analysis 
the only difference between the two analyses on the interest sensitive liabilities are the callable features on the fhlb advances 
the gap analysis reflects the call dates while the market risk analysis uses the advances contractual maturity dates

abnh was capitalized with an initial contribution of million in and additional contributions of million in and million in the company made payments of dividends to stockholders in the amount of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the goal of the company s liquidity management process is to assess funding requirements so as to efficiently meet the cash needs of borrowers and depositors  while also providing funds for attractive investment opportunities 
the banks have a diverse base of funding 
sources of liquidity include maturation  amortization and prepayment of the investment and loan portfolios 
another source of liquidity is funds purchased from other banks  the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  customer repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the fhlb  of which andover bank is a voluntary member 
the banks may also obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston by pledging certain assets 
at december   the company had home equity  reserve credit and commercial unused lines of credit totalling million 
outstanding commitments to originate loans totalled million 
unadvanced portions of construction and land loans amounted to million 
standby letters of credit were million 
loans sold with recourse totalled million 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet these commitments if and as called upon 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million to at december   and increased by  to million at december  the change in was primarily due to a reduced provision for loan losses and an increase in assets held for sale 
the change in was attributable to increased net income offset by a decrease in assets held for sale 
cash flows used by investing activities increased by million to million during and increased million during to million 
the increase in was attributable to a reduction in sales of investments available for sale combined with a million increase in whole loans purchased during the year 
the increase in was primarily due to purchases of investments available for sale 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million to million during mainly attributable to an increase in total deposits 
the increase of million during was also primarily due to a significant increase in total deposits 
capital resources at december   the company reported total capital of million  or of total assets as compared to million  or at december  the company and the banks continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of all applicable regulatory minimums

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations of andover is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of the year issue included in other noninterest expenses in are charges incurred in connection with the modification or replacement of software and hardware in order for the company s computer systems to properly recognize dates beyond december  the company has completed its assessment of year issues  developed a plan  and arranged for the required resources to complete the necessary remediation efforts 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project within one year  or not later than december  the total remaining cost of the year project is estimated at  to  through december   the company has incurred and expensed approximately  related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
the company will incur costs through the year  however  it does not anticipate that material incremental costs will be incurred in any single period 
additionally  a significant portion of costs pertaining to the year project are not expected to be incremental to the company  but rather represent a reprioritization of existing internal systems technology resources 
since the company outsources all of its major data processing systems  it has initiated formal communications with all of its significant vendors to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely remediated 
therefore  the company could possibly be negatively impacted to the extent other entities not affiliated with the company are unsuccessful in properly addressing this issue 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
recent accounting developments in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  disclosures of information about capital structure  which is effective for financial statements 
the company s disclosures currently comply with the provisions of this statement 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income  which is defined as all changes to equity except investments by  and distributions to  shareholders 
net income is a component of comprehensive income  with all other components referred to in the aggregate as other comprehensive income 
also in june  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments 
an operating segment is defined as a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance 
sfas requires a company to disclose certain income statement and balance sheet information by operating segment  as well as provide a reconciliation of operating segment information to the company s consolidated balances 
sfas and sfas are effective for annual financial statements and are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
