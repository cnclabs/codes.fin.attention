net cash used in operating activities totaled million during at december   working capital was approximately million as compared to million at december  due primarily to the loss sustained by the company in fiscal working capital may vary from time to time as a result of seasonality  new product introductions  capital expenditures and changes in inventory levels 
to supplement cash flow from operations the company maintains a million revolving credit facility with a factor to be used for general working capital purposes 
all obligations under the credit agreement  which includes a letter of credit facility  are collateralized by the company s inventory and receivables 
the company s borrowings are limited to of eligible inventory and of eligible receivables 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants with respect to the conduct of the company s business and requires the maintenance of various financial levels and ratios 
as of december   the company was in violation of certain covenants  however  the company subsequently received a waiver from its factor for the violations 
the company had borrowings of million outstanding on the line of credit as of december  in april  the credit facility was amended to a million revolving credit line which is collateralized by inventory  receivables  machinery and equipment and tradenames 
the covenants in the credit agreement under which the company was in violation at december  were modified in the amended agreement 
the company s borrowings under the amended agreement are limited to eligible inventory and receivables 
advances under the amended agreement bear interest at the prime rate plus 
whereas the company s factoring and finance agreements run through june   the revolving line is committed through january  with an extension through march   subject to certain conditions 
the agreement provides for early termination penalties during the first three years 
historically  the company has sold a substantial portion of its trade accounts receivable to a factor  which assumes the credit risk with respect to collection of nonrecourse accounts receivable in exchange for a fee 
the factor approves the credit of the company s customers prior to sale 
if the factor disapproves of a sale to a customer and the company decides to proceed with the sale  the company bears the credit risk 
prior to july  the factoring agreement provided that the company could request advances against a percentage of qualifying accounts receivable 
in conjunction with the company s credit facility  the advance facility associated with the factoring agreement was terminated 
the factoring agreement is in force until june  cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for and was comprised of capital expenditures related primarily to the costs to construct tenant improvements and equip the company s new corporate headquarters and construction of in store shops 
in may  the company entered into a year lease for its new headquarters and distribution facility in irvine  california  which it occupied in july by reason of the company s treatment as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes  the company  since inception through its initial public offering  provided to its sole stockholder funds for the payment of income taxes on the earnings of the company through the termination of s corporation status 
in addition  the company historically paid dividends to its sole stockholder to provide a return on investment 
in connection with its initial public offering  the company s s corporation status was terminated and the company declared the final s corporation distribution of its previously undistributed earnings 
for the year ended december  the company paid dividends  including amounts attributable to the payment of taxes and a portion of the final s corporation distribution  of million 
for the foreseeable future  earnings will be retained in the operation of the business 
significant accounting estimates in recent years certain customers of the company have experienced financial difficulties  including the filing of reorganization under bankruptcy laws 
the company has not generally incurred significant losses outside the normal course of business as a result of the financial difficulties of these customers 
while management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at december  is adequate  the company carefully monitors developments regarding its major customers 
additional material financial difficulties encountered by these or other customers could have an adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or profitability 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured  the company does not believe that they have had a material effect on the company s net sales or profitability 
in the past  the company has been able to offset its foreign product cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers  although no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to make such increases or changes in the future 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for substantially all of its product sales and its licensing revenues 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last two fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires the dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
the company adopted this pronouncement in fiscal and the company s financial statements now include net income per share assuming no dilution from outstanding options  and net income per share assuming dilution 
prior periods were restated to reflect the adoption of this pronouncement 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components and sfas no 
establishes standards for the way public companies report financial information about operating segments 
the company will adopt both in fiscal  as required 
these statements will affect disclosure and presentation in the financial statements but will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  cash flows or results of operations 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause the company s systems and applications to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the company is currently in the process of investigating whether its internal accounting systems and other operational systems are year compliant 
the company has been informed by the vendor of its internal accounting software that upgrades that will bring such software into year compliance are currently available and will provide them to the company under its existing software maintenance agreement 
the company expects to effect the conversion of its internal accounting system to such upgraded software by the end of the company believes that necessary conversions of other operational systems can also be accomplished through vendor upgrades and enhancements as provided under its system maintenance agreements currently in effect 
the company does not anticipate significant costs associated with any necessary conversions 
however  there can be no assurance that certain of the company s internal computer systems or networks or those of its key vendors and distributors will not be adversely affected by such year issues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition
