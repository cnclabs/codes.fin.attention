overview newmil earned net income of  or 
per share  for the year ended june   compared with net income of  or per share  for fiscal year net income grew in  reflecting significantly improved core earnings  driven by higher net interest income and non interest income  and partly offset by increased operating expenses 
earnings per share increased  reflecting both the growth in net income and share repurchase activity 
over the past five years newmil has achieved a steady improvement in core earnings 
this is attributed to a continuing strategy which includes refining both the mix and the quality of newmil s earning assets  controlling operating expenses  and reducing non performing assets 
with a loan to deposit ratio of only at june   newmil has ample capacity to grow its loan portfolio 
the following discussion and analysis of newmil s consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
results of operations comparison between and analysis of net interest and dividend income net interest income increased  or  to  in this resulted from growth of million  or  in average earning assets  driven by an increase in average investments of million  or  and an increase in average loans of million  or

the level of net interest income is a function of volume  rates and mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels as determined by newmil s gap position  measured by the differences between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing within different future time periods 
interest income total interest and dividend income increased  or  to million in loan income increased  or  as a result of higher loan volume offset by slightly lower average yield 
average loans increased million  or  to million in as compared with the decrease in average loan yield  down basis points  was mostly due to lower yields on loans originated during investment income increased  or  in as a result of higher average volume  offset in part by a slightly lower average yield 
average securities increased million  or  while average federal funds balances remained fairly constant 
increases in us treasury notes and us government agency bonds of million  or  and mortgaged backed securities of million  or were partly offset by a decline of million  or in other bonds and notes  principally collateralized mortgage obligations 
the decrease in average investment yield  down basis points  resulted from changes in portfolio mix and lower market yields on securities purchased 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in primarily as a result of deposit growth and higher average borrowings 
deposit expense increased  or  as a result of a million  or  increase in average interest bearing deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits remained unchanged at 
deposit growth occurred in all deposit categories  but was concentrated in certificates of deposits  which increased million  and now accounts  which increased million 
borrowings expense increased  primarily as a result of additional borrowings in  including term advances at higher rates  to fund securities purchases 
borrowings at june  consisted of one to five year term advances with fixed rates ranging from to 
borrowings at june  had terms of days or less 
provision and allowance for loan losses newmil provided  for loan losses in  down from  in changes in the allowance for loan losses during each of the past three years are as follows years ended june  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year    provision for losses charge offs recoveries balance  end of year    ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans to total gross loans loan loss provision to average loans net charge offs recoveries to average loans newmil has achieved a steady reduction in non performing loans in each of the past three years 
this improvement in loan quality  together with limited loan portfolio growth  allowed newmil to lower its loan provision in during non performing loans decreased million  or  to million at june   or of gross loans 
as a result  the reserve coverage to non performing loans increased to 
past due performing loans accruing loans days past due increased slightly during  and at june  were of gross loans 
newmil remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans 
for a discussion on loan quality see asset quality and portfolio risk 
the bank determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgement the allowance for loan losses at june   is adequate 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the state of connecticut  department of banking  in march and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of this examination 
non interest income non interest income increased  or  to  in much of this increase is attributable to a  gain on the sale of a non performing loan in the principal categories of non interest income are as follows years ended june  in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts  gains on sales of loans  net loan servicing securities losses gains  net  gain on sale of non performing loan other total non interest income   the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in reflects increased transaction volume  resulting from growth in demand deposit and now accounts  fees from the generations gold family club introduced in  and increased debit card transactions volume 
the increase in gains from sales of residential mortgage loans resulted from loan sales of million in compared with million in secondary market loan sales are generally pre arranged on a loan by loan basis prior to origination and loans are sold service released 
the decrease in loan servicing fees in resulted from a decrease in the mortgage servicing portfolio  which at june  totaled million  down from million at june  the net securities losses in and were realized on securities sales of million and million  respectively 
net securities losses include a loss of  from the sale of a collateralized mortgage obligation cmo which was classified as held to maturity 
in october newmil engaged a financial securities consultant to analyze this cmo 
based on this review newmil determined that it was highly probable that newmil would likely receive substantially less than the contractual interest on this cmo and that the cmo could experience a significant decline in market value 
newmil concluded that these and other changes in circumstances surrounding this cmo were isolated  non recurring  and highly unusual  and could not have been reasonably anticipated 
in may newmil realized a gain of  from the sale of its largest remaining non performing loan 
the gain resulted from the sale of the loan to a buyer whose intended use of the property added significant value which was not anticipated 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  or  in in newmil opened two branch offices  in southbury and norwalk  connecticut  which opened in july and october  respectively 
these offices added approximately  to operating expenses  principally compensation  occupancy and equipment expense 
other increases in include the write off of obsolete equipment and a prepaid maintenance contract as the bank prepares to convert its legacy computer system to a client server  relational database system in november these increases were offset in part by a significant reduction in professional  collection and oreo expense 
the principal categories of operating expenses are as follows years ended june  in thousands change salaries   employee benefits   occupancy  equipment professional  collection and oreo expense insurance postage and telecommunications marketing service bureau other operating   total operating expenses   the increase in salaries in was due primarily to increase in staffing levels at the new branches and annual salary increases 
employee benefits expense increased as a result of additional health  taxes and other benefits related to the increased staffing levels and increased medical claims from the bank s self insured plan 
these increases were partly offset by net income related to the bank s pension plan 
the increase in occupancy expense is primarily related to the two additional branches 
equipment expense for included  to write off obsolete computer equipment and prepaid maintenance related to the bank s legacy computer system as the bank prepares to convert to a new client server system 
professional  collection and oreo expense included expenditures related to audit  accounting  legal  appraisal  property tax  insurance  other workout related expenses  together with gains and losses on oreo sales and the provision for oreo losses 
the decrease in resulted from a decrease in professional fees and a negative provision to the oreo reserve  offset in part by an increase in collection expenses and a decrease in oreo gains 
the increase in insurance expense resulted from both increased fdic insurance premiums related to deposit growth and increase in premiums relating to the new branches 
all other operating expenses  including marketing  shareholder relations  office expense and other  increased  or in this increase is attributed principally to increased lending activity  the additional branch locations  various deposit and loan marketing promotions and other changes in operating activities

interest income total interest and dividend income increased  or  to million in loan income increased  or  as a result of higher volume offset by slightly lower overall yield 
average loans grew million  or  to million in as compared with the decrease in the average loan yield resulted primarily from downward portfolio repricing on residential adjustable rate mortgages due to lower interest rates  which also affected new loan rates 
interest and dividends from securities and federal funds increased  or  in as a result of higher overall volume coupled with a marginally higher yield 
mortgage backed security prepayments have continued to decline which reduces the amortization expense  thereby increasing the yield on the mortgage backed security portfolio 
while average securities declined million  or  average federal funds balances increased million 
the change in average yield resulted from changes in portfolio mix and market interest rates on securities purchased 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in primarily as a result of deposit growth and higher average borrowings  offset in part by slightly lower cost of funds which decreased basis point

at june   of the portfolio consisted of floating rate cmos and mbss  which generally reprice monthly based on spreads to various indices  subject to life time caps and floors 
total floating rate securities had a projected weighted average duration and life of years and years  respectively  based on median projected prepayment speeds at current interest rates 
floating rate securities are tied primarily to the eleventh district cost of funds index  and to other treasury indices 
all floating rate securities are match funded with core deposits 
the remaining of the portfolio was represented by federal home loan bank stock 
at june   securities totaling million  or  were classified as available for sale and securities totaling million  or  were classified as held to maturity 
included in shareholders equity at june  is an adjustment of  net of taxes  relating to securities transferred in a prior year from available for sale to held to maturity  representing net unrealized losses at the time of transfer adjusted for subsequent principal amortization  net of taxes 
all of the cmos were purchased in and early  and subsequent movements in interest rates and market conditions have resulted in a net decline in the fair market value of certain classes of floating rate cmos 
at june  net unrealized losses for all available for sale and held to maturity securities  being the difference between current fair market value and amortized cost  totaled million 
fluctuations in fair market values caused by movements in interest rates and market conditions will not necessarily adversely impact future earnings

accruing loans past due days or more at june  consist of five residential mortgage loans and one sba guaranteed commercial loan  all of which are in the process of collection and where the collection of accrued interest is probable 
newmil pursues the resolution of all non performing assets through restructurings  credit enhancements or collections 
when collection procedures do not bring a loan into performing or restructured status  newmil generally initiates action to foreclose the property or to acquire it by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
newmil actively markets all oreo and in sold million of oreo from which net gains of  were realized 
during newmil recorded a  negative provision against the oreo valuation reserve and at june  the reserve was  or of oreo 
in addition to non performing assets  at june  newmil had  of performing classified loans that are considered potential problem loans 
although not impaired  performing classified loans  in the opinion of management  exhibit a higher than normal degree of risk and warrant monitoring due to various considerations  including i the degree of documentation supporting the borrower s current financial position  ii potential weaknesses in the borrowers ability to service the loan  iii possible collateral value deficiency  and iv other risk factors such as geographic location  industry focus and negatively trending financial results 
these deficiencies create some uncertainty  but not serious doubt  as to the borrowers ability to comply with the loan repayment terms in the future 
management believes the reserves for these loans are adequate 
deposits and borrowings deposits increased million  or  during to million  aided by the opening of two new branch offices 
in july newmil opened an in store supermarket branch in southbury  connecticut  and in october opened a branch office in norwalk  connecticut 
the company has branch offices located in fairfield  litchfield and new haven counties 
all deposit categories grew during savings  money market and now accounts grew million  or  certificates of deposit grew million  or  and demand deposits grew million  or

borrowings at june  consisted of federal home loan bank advances with terms ranging from one to five years and fixed rates ranging from to 
the borrowings were used to match certain securities purchases 
borrowings at june  had terms of days or less 
liquidity newmil manages its liquidity position to ensure that there is sufficient funding availability at all times to meet both anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals  new loan originations  securities purchases and other operating cash outflows 
the primary sources of liquidity are principal payments and maturities of securities and loans  short term borrowings through repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances  net deposit growth and funds provided by operations 
liquidity can also be provided through sales of loans and available for sale securities 
operating activities in provided net cash flows of million  up from million in during investing activities used net cash of million  principally for net security purchases

funds provided by operating and financing activities were utilized to fund investing activities and to increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
at june   newmil s liquidity ratio  as represented by cash  short term available for sale securities  marketable assets  the ability to borrow against held to maturity securities and loans through unused fhlb and other short term borrowing capacity  of approximately million  to net deposits and short term unsecured liabilities  was  well in excess of newmil s minimum guideline of 
at june   newmil had outstanding commitments to fund new loan originations of million  construction mortgage commitments of million and unused lines of credit of million 
newmil has committed to the conversion of its legacy computer system to a client server  relational database system in november the cost of the new hardware and software  which includes the replacement of all teller terminals is approximately  of which  has been expended through june  this cost will be capitalized and depreciated over the fixed assets useful lives 
the annual operating expense of the new system is estimated to be approximately the same as that of the present system 
these commitments will be met in the normal course of business 
newmil believes that its liquidity sources will continue to provide funding sufficient to support operating activities  loan originations and commitments  and deposit withdrawals 
asset liability management and market risk newmil manages interest rate risk with the objective of maintaining a high and stable net interest margin under changing interest rate environments 
interest rate risk is measured using gap analysis  to identify short medium and long term interest rate risk positions  and simulation analysis  to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
newmil seeks to manage interest rate risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth newmil s interest rate sensitivity position  or gap position  at june   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market deposits have been presented in the within month category and savings and now deposits have been presented in the to months category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the repricing periods presented due to differences in their repricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates

a liability sensitive gap implies that newmil s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
newmil simulates earnings at risk over a twelve month horizon by ramping interest rates basis points from the current rate environment 
newmil s asset liability management responds to changes in interest rates and market conditions 
the simulation analysis incorporates numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes  including growth and product mix  product pricing and the behavior of interest rates 
newmil s policy is to ensure that the change in net income over the twelve month horizon within the basis point band will not exceed 
the following table indicates that the estimated percentage change in net income over the next twelve month forecast horizon is within the tolerance limit 
change change in in rate net income bp bp due to the numerous assumptions in the simulation analysis  actual results will differ from estimated results 
factors other than changes in interest rates could also impact net income 
a significant factor in determining newmil s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all of newmil s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts which tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
the entry of new competitors into newmil s market area may pressure newmil to change its loan and deposit pricing which may negatively affect newmil s net interest margin 
newmil structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio repricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
capital resources during shareholders equity increased  or  to million  while book value per share increased to at june  the increase in shareholders equity resulted from earnings of  per share  a  decrease in the adjustment to shareholders equity for net unrealized holding losses on securities  net of taxes   from the exercise of stock options  and  from the reissuance of treasury stock  offset by treasury stock purchases of  and cash dividends of  per share  a payout ratio 
in july newmil announced its intention to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock in the open market and unsolicited negotiated transactions  including block purchases

sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  july  for newmil 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management anticipates that  due to its limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on newmil s results of operations or its financial position 
year because many operating systems have been programmed to use a two digit number to represent the year eg  for  all systems must be analyzed  and necessary software and hardware changes made  to ensure that they will function correctly when the date changes to january  during  newmil developed and implemented a year plan to ensure that its operating systems  and those of its outside vendors and suppliers  will function correctly in the year and beyond 
newmil expects to be compliant with its year plan by march  as part of this plan newmil has committed to the conversion of its legacy computer system to a client server  relational database system in november this system has been certified year compliant by the supplying vendor and newmil will be verifying compliance within the time frame of its year plan 
the annual operating expense of the new system is estimated to be approximately the same as that of the present system 
based on current information  management believes that specific costs related to newmil s year systems issues will not have a material impact on the operations  cash flows or financial condition of newmil 
impact of inflation and changing prices newmil s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices have  in past years  resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect newmil s earnings in future periods
