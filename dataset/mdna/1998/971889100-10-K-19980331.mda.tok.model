item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s oil and gas operating performance is influenced by several factors 
the most significant are the prices received for the sale of oil and gas and the sales volume 
for  the average price of oil that the company received was compared to for  a price decrease of 
average gas prices received by the company in were higher than average gas prices 
the average price of gas for was compared to for the following table reflects the average prices received by the company for oil and gas  the average production cost per boe  and the amount of the company s oil and gas production for the fiscal years presented fiscal year ended december crude oil and natural gas production oil bbls    gas mcf    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf average production costs per boe sales prices received by the company for oil and gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
the fluctuations in oil prices during these periods primarily reflected market uncertainty regarding the inability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to control the production of its member countries  as well as concerns related to global supply and demand for crude oil 
gas prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in the spot market price for gas 
it is impossible to predict future price movements with certainty 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income for the year ended december increased from  in to  in  an increase of

liquidity and capital resources at december  the company had approximately million in marketable securities at cost  with a market value of approximately million 
the current ratio at december  was to on a market basis  which management considers adequate for the company s current business 
the company s working capital was approximately million at december  the company anticipates that cash provided by operating activities and investing activities will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements to acquire oil and gas properties and to drill and evaluate these and other oil and gas properties presently held by the company 
the level of oil and gas capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on market conditions  including the price of oil and the demand for natural gas  and other related factors 
as the company has no material long term commitments with respect to its oil and gas capital expenditure plans  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of its expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company plans to actively continue its exploration and production activities as well as search for the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties and of companies with desirable oil and gas producing properties 
there can be no assurance that the company will in fact locate any such acquisitions 
during the year ended  the company acquired six real estate properties from the trust company of new jersey the trust company at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
these transactions were financed with first mortgage loans from the trust company 
the company will explore other real estate acquisitions as they arise 
the timing of any such acquisition will depend on  among other things  economic conditions and the favorable evaluation of specific opportunities presented to the company 
the company is currently planning further acquisitions of investment properties during the next year 
accordingly  while the company anticipates that it will actively explore these and other real estate acquisition opportunities  no assurance can be given that any such acquisition will occur 
during the fourth quarter of  the company refinanced with criimi mae and citicorp the original mortgage loans on the company s first two real estate property acquisitions 
these properties were acquired in at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
due to the significant appreciation in the value of these properties  the lender granted first mortgage loans in the aggregate amount of million  which is million in excess of the company s original cost of these properties

financial accounting standards board statement no 
disclosures the following disclosures are those required to be made by publicly traded enterprises under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities 
the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as those estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are those that can be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves are as follows disclosures of oil and gas producing activities as required by financial accounting standards board statement no

future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements 
estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year  based on year end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
estimated future income tax expenses are calculated by applying year end statutory tax rates adjusted for permanent differences and tax credits to estimated future pretax net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves  less the tax basis of the properties involved 
these estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the financial accounting standards board and the sec 
due to unpredictable variances in expenses and capital forecasts  crude oil and natural gas price changes and the fact that the basis for such estimates vary significantly  management believes the usefulness of these projections is limited 
estimates of future net cash flows do not represent management s assessment of future profitability or future cash flow to the company 
management s investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates that include proved reserves prescribed by the sec as well as probable reserves  and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here 
it should be recognized that applying current costs and prices at a percent standard discount rate allows for comparability but does not convey absolute value 
the discounted amounts arrived at are only one measure of financial quantification of proved reserves 
there were no oil and gas estimates filed with or included in reports to any other federal or foreign governmental authority or agency within the last twelve months 
reserves in the united states were estimated by ramsey engineering inc and the company 
reserves in canada were estimated by citidal engineering  ltd 
total costs both capitalized and expensed  incurred in oil and gas producing activities including capitalized interest  cost incurred in property acquisition  exploration and development activities and results of operations from oil and gas producing activities during the three years ended december   and are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  presented elsewhere herein
