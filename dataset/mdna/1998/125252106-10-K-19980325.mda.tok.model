offsetting this increase  however  is a seasonal decrease in pharmaceutical product sales  as people typically defer elective surgeries between thanksgiving and new years 
in addition  many of the companys customers attempt to reduce their inventories prior to the calendar year end 
consequently  first quarter sales are typically stronger than the preceding fourth quarter 
the gross profit in the third quarter of was lower due to unusually high startup costs due to new technology relating to the introduction by the company of a new product for the manufactured housing industry and lower sales volume spreading fixed costs over fewer units 
selling  general and administrative expense increased as a result of a onetime investment whereby the company engaged the services of a consulting firm to develop a marketing strategy for the pacific rim and approximately  of service costs due to the reengineering of manufacturing functions 
the selling  general and administrative expenses increase in the fourth quarter of represented an increase in expenses due to the northern bank note company acquisition in september  liquidity and capital resources the companys primary sources of working capital have been net cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings under various loan agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
this is a  increase over and resulted in a  increase in cash for the year ended december  the cash increase was primarily the result of four factors depreciation and amortization expense increased by  to  as a result of placing the companys new press in service during  trade payables increased by  due to both better terms and cash management  accrued expenses  including amounts owed to the minority partner in applied holographics and employee bonus increased by  and restricted cash used to fund the new press decreased by  offsetting these increases to cash  the company invested  in the acquisition of northern bank note company and  in new plant and equipment 
additionally  inventories increased by  due in part to managements decision to support key markets and customers with higher inventory levels 
trade receivables were up by  solely as a result of the increased sales levels in the companys capital expenditures totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  and included the acquisition of high speed computerized slitting equipment in and payments for the new wide printing press in and to fund their income tax liabilities on the companys net income and the repayment of stockholder loans  the company previously made scorporation dividends to its existing stockholders of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  which included a special million scorporation dividend paid immediately prior to the closing of the ipo in in june  the company received proceeds of approximately  pursuant to an illinois revenue bond financing  which matures in these proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of the new wide printing press and related plant additions to ensure capacity for the continued growth of the companys printed products line 
at december   the entire amount had been drawn upon 
the company incurred  of costs associated with the issuance of the bonds  which are being amortized over twelve years 
on september   the company also issued to the seller of northern bank note company  a nineyear  subordinated note in the principal amount of million  which is convertible in whole or in part  at the option of the holder beginning after the first anniversary of the note  into the companys common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the companys revolving credit agreement with a bank the credit facility provides for borrowings under an unsecured revolving credit loan  with total borrowings not to exceed  the principal balance of the revolving credit loan was zero at december  the revolving credit loan expires april  and bears interest at the banks prime rate at december  or  at the companys option  at libor at december  plus 
a 
fee is applied for undrawn funds 
the credit facility also provides for two term loans 
the outstanding principal balance of term loan a was  as of december  and is due april  interest on term loan a accrues at the banks prime rate plus  but not to exceed 
the credit facility contains covenants which limit aggregate annual lease payments to  and prohibit the declaration of dividends other than scorporation dividends and the million scorporation dividend and transactions between the company and its affiliates 
it is also an event of default under the credit facility if the company incurs any net losses for any fiscal period 
the company believes that the net cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the credit facility are sufficient to finance the companys growth 
seasonality and impact of inflation historically  the company has experienced lower net sales levels during the fourth quarter and increased net sales levels during the following first quarter 
this is due to typical yearend depletion of inventories by the companys customers 
it is also due in large part to the holidays at the end of the year  as the companys customers have an increased number of holiday plant closings 
in addition  fourth quarter pharmaceutical product sales generally are lower as a result of the postponement of elective surgeries during holiday periods 
however  due to the strong growth of printed products  the fourth quarter sales have been greater than the third quarter sales in each of the last two years 
inflation has not had a material impact on the companys net sales or income to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the companys business will not be affected by inflation in the future
