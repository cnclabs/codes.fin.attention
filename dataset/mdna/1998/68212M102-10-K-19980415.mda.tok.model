liquidity and capital resources since the company s inception on february   it has financed its business growth primarily through operations  common stock sales and short term borrowings from stockholders 
the company s cash and cash equivalents position at december   was 
million compared to million on december  the million decrease in cash was due primarily to the cost of national magazine advertising and the development of an infomercial for the mass market distribution channel in the first half of the magazine advertising was not targeted to health food store shoppers and proved to be ineffective in producing increased revenue and the infomercial was discontinued after an unsuccessful test 
the company ended the latest year with working capital of million and a to working capital ratio

million in fourth quarter sales in when compared to the same period in inventories were valued at million at december  as compared to million at december   which represents a decrease or million 
the decline in inventories was due primarily to a sale to a barter company which reduced inventories 
million 
management attributes the rest of the inventory reduction to better inventory and vendor management

the intangible assets decreased 
million in due primarily to an adjustment in the value of those assets 
at december   other assets included barter credits related to a sale of inventory to active media services  inc the barter credits will be used by health to pay for certain normal business expenditures  including  but not limited to  media advertising and promotion  travel  capital purchases and printing 
barter credits made up 
million of other assets at december  the balance of other assets at december  consisted of the aforementioned intangible assets  prepaid expenses and deposits 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 
million due primarily to borrowing on the company s line of credit with norwest business credit  inc  which line had a balance of 
million at december  borrowings have been used primarily to pay vendors and suppliers for inventory needed for the normal seasonal first quarter increase in sales activity anticipated in and to finance additional accounts receivable generated in the fourth quarter of available borrowing capacity in addition to the amount outstanding on the revolving line of credit at december  was 
million  and at march  was 
million 
the decrease in deferred taxes from 
million at december  to 
million at december  was related to timing differences in accrued liabilities  sales reserves  depreciation and amortization 
the company used cash for operating activities of million in and million in million in cash was generated in from investing activities  the majority of which came from the surgical acquisition 
this cash  together with the cash on hand at the beginning of of 
million and the additional borrowings from financing activities in of 
million has allowed the company to fund these operating losses and some capital expenditures 
the company reduced its operating costs over 
million in the last six months of as compared to the first half of although cash used in operations in the second half of increased slightly over the first half of  the increase was due to a large reduction of accounts payable using the company s line of credit 
cash flows from operations in the first quarter of continues to improve 
the company is not anticipating significant future capital requirements 
such investment will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of orders from customers  the expansion of sales and marketing efforts  costs associated with entering into new channels of distribution  the ability of the company to increase sales beyond the break even point and the status of competitive products 
the company believes  however  that the timing of any required expenditures will be somewhat discretionary 
in january  the company entered into a merger agreement with irwin naturals  a company also engaged in the nutritional supplement business 
the company expects the anticipated merger to substantially increase its revenue stream and its cash flow generated from operations with minimal additional cost 
management believes that its working capital and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its cash operating requirements over the next months 
nevertheless  because of its anticipated sales growth  the company continues to explore sources of additional capital for future needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional financing earlier than anticipated 
further  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at acceptable terms to the company or at all 
the inability to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations
