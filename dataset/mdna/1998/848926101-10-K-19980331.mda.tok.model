item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the registrant considers the us adhesive backed materials industry to be over billion  consisting of the approximately billion total tape market and the approximately billion adhesive backed label stock market includes adhesive backed label stock revenues plus estimated revenues added by printing  cutting and other converting and finishing operations 
the registrant is one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of carton sealing tape and adhesive backed label stock products in the united states 
central products branded and private label carton sealing tape products are used primarily for commercial packaging applications  including the packaging of goods for shipment by manufacturing  retail and distribution companies  and are sold through its national sales force to over  paper and office products distributors nationwide 
spinnaker coating offers a full line of more than  variations of label stock and sells its products in roll or sheet form to over  printers  paper merchants and industrial users  who convert the label stock into labels used for a broad range of end use applications  including bar coding  mailing and shipping  packaging for pharmaceutical  food and other consumer products  office identification and business forms  postage stamp stock  decorative labels and other specialty industrial uses 
the registrant also manufactures and markets industrial process equipment and air pollution control scrubbers through entoleter 
since june  the registrant has experienced rapid growth  which has been accomplished through the registrant s acquisition of its carton sealing tape and label stock manufacturing operations and the registrant s subsequent internal growth 
the internal growth is a result of the registrant s implementation of its core competencies to the operations after they were acquired by the registrant  including refocused sales and marketing strategy and additional capital investment at all subsidiaries 
the company invested approximately million over the last two years to improve manufacturing efficiencies  which has lowered manufacturing costs and improved production efficiencies  while simultaneously increasing production capacity 
the investments included an expansion in coating capacity for label stock production  which lowered manufacturing costs  and enhancements in its film line  which increased tape production capacity 
with the acquisition of spinnaker coating in  the registrant entered the adhesive backed materials industry 
the central products acquisition in provided the registrant with a leading position in the carton sealing tape market of the adhesive backed materials industry 
as a result of the foregoing acquisitions  the registrant became a manufacturer of the broadest line of adhesive backed label stock and carton sealing tape products in the adhesive backed materials industry 
the coating maine acquisition see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  further strengthens the registrant s position in the adhesive backed materials market 
the registrant believes the combination of coating maine with spinnaker coating s adhesive backed label stock business will make the registrant the fifth largest producer of label stock and the second largest manufacturer of edp label stock 
subsequent to each of the foregoing acquisitions  the registrant implemented cost reduction measures  including more effective management  rationalization of raw materials and component purchasing  improved materials flow and improved management information systems 
the registrant believes such measures contributed to improved operating profits at the registrant s carton sealing tape and label stock manufacturing operations during the registrant has historically operated at a high level of capacity utilization and has increased capacity of the acquired plant facilities through operating efficiency improvements 
for example  in order to meet production capacity requirements under the postage stamp stock agreements awarded to spinnaker coating in and  spinnaker coating invested approximately million to add a production line for silicone coating 
during  before the addition of the new production line  spinnaker coating outsourced a portion of its silicone coated liner requirement 
the registrant incurred higher costs of sales approximately million for the year ended december   as a result of such outsourcing 
the installation of the additional production line was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of and became fully operational in january  which enabled the registrant to meet its future silicone liner production requirements and eliminate the costs that were historically associated with outsourcing for the silicone liner 
the cost of the registrant s principal raw materials  polypropylene resin and paper  have generally remained stable over the past several years 
during fiscal  however  raw material cost increases resulted in the registrant instituting higher prices  consistent with the increases instituted by its competitors  for its carton sealing tape and adhesive backed label stock products 
the increases in raw material costs during fiscal for the registrant s products did not materially impact the registrant s gross profit because the registrant was generally able to pass along its raw material cost increases without negatively impacting sales of its products 
during fiscal and  the registrant s principal raw material costs generally remained stable or declined 
the agreements under which the registrant s carton sealing tape products and its other adhesive backed label stock products are sold generally do not contain adjustment mechanisms for fluctuations in the cost of raw materials 
however  the registrant has generally passed along raw material price changes for products sold under such agreements  as well as for products sold to other customers 
the exception to the foregoing is the registrant s supply agreement relating to pressure sensitive label stock used by the postal service  which provides for pre determined annual price increases 
the postal service agreement gives the registrant protection against limited price increases to the extent that increases in costs of raw materials are no more than the increases provided by such agreement 
in order to protect against raw material price increases that exceed the annual price increases under the postal service agreement  the registrant has entered into supply agreements with its raw material suppliers that have ceilings on future price increases 
the future impact of a change in raw material costs on the registrant s profitability is based in part on pricing by the registrant s competitors 
although historically the registrant has generally been able to pass through raw material cost fluctuations  the registrant cannot be assured that future raw material cost increases can be passed through to its customers or that such cost increases will not negatively impact the registrant s gross profit 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the registrant s net sales were million compared to million in net sales of carton sealing tapes were impacted by the registrant s decision to terminate a relationship with an existing customer of the registrant s reinforced and box tape products which reduced year to year net sales by approximately million 
unit sales of carton sealing products  excluding the terminated agreement  increased from levels  which more than offset lower average selling prices resulting from changes in product mix and increased market competition 
unit sales of pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock were impacted by the delayed release of certain orders by the us bureau of engraving and printing until late december  and inventory level adjustments by key consumer and converter product customers  while lower average selling prices of pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock were a result of market competition to maintain certain unit sales volumes 
the decrease in net sales for also reflects a decline of million in sales of industrial equipment and higher freight costs 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the improvement in gross margins is attributable to lower average unit manufacturing costs of adhesive backed material products and improved manufacturing variances 
the installation of a new silicone coater at the registrant s adhesive backed label stock manufacturing facility  which became operational in january  enabled the registrant to significantly increase internal silicone coating capacity and eliminate the need to outsource a portion of its silicone coater requirements  resulting in savings during in  the registrant incurred approximately million of outsourcing costs attributable to silicone coating capacity constraints 
the registrant s tape production operations steadily improved throughout in comparison to  and showed significant improvement with respect to manufacturing variances experienced as recently as the first quarter of the registrant attributes these improvements in manufacturing variances to efficiencies gained through reductions of manufacturing personnel  material process and handling modifications and capital investments made over the past twelve to fifteen months which has enabled the registrant to increase output and reduce manufacturing downtime 
the registrant is continuing to focus its management efforts and capital investments on improving manufacturing efficiencies and increasing capacity 
income from operations 
income from operations was approximately million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the improved operating results are attributable to capital investments in manufacturing and mis processes  and lower administrative expenses  which offset year to year increases in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately million 
interest expense 
interest expense for totaled million  of which approximately thousand relates to amortization of deferred financing costs 
in  interest expense totaled million  of which approximately thousand related to amortization of deferred financing costs 
the increase in cash interest is attributable to higher average outstanding debt obligations and related interest rates for the fiscal year 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes is at an effective rate of 
the registrant s tax rate is impacted by permanent tax differences  primarily non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the central products acquisition amortized over years 
cash income taxes are currently limited to state income taxes  as the registrant has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
net income 
the registrant recorded a net loss of million or per share for  versus a net loss of million or per share in in  the registrant recorded an extraordinary charge of approximately million net of income taxes  or a loss per share 
the charge was attributed to the extinguishment of the registrant s previously existing credit facilities and the write off of related deferred financing costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal was highlighted by several transactions unique to operations as compared to previous fiscal years 
during  the registrant completed a financial reorganization to improve the registrant s capital structure and provide a source of long term financing 
in the fourth quarter of the registrant issued million of senior secured notes senior notes 
the senior notes require semi annual interest payments and mature october proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to extinguish certain long term obligations and all working capital revolver obligations then outstanding 
in addition  the registrant established its revolving credit facility 
a portion of the revolving credit facility may be used to fund acquisitions 
in the same quarter  concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes  the registrant acquired the minority interest in its spinnaker coating subsidiary 
the terms of the acquisition involved a cash payment  issuance of registrant common stock and a right to a contingent payment 
fiscal was the first full year of operations to include central products  as on october   the registrant  through its wholly owned subsidiary  purchased in the central products acquisition the stock and assets of alco s central products operation  which manufactures a variety of carton sealing tapes 
therefore  includes twelve months of operations at central products compared to three months in net sales 
the registrant s net sales were million  an increase of when compared with net sales in the increase in net sales was the result of the central products acquisition  improved marketing efforts at central products and the growth at spinnaker coating 
spinnaker coating s units increased approximately on the strength of a refocused sales and marketing strategy inclusive of two long term contracts with the postal service for the supply of postage stamp paper stock 
central products improved marketing efforts and relationships with its national accounts  in an extremely competitive pricing market  increased pressure sensitive tape units approximately 
the central products acquisition accounts for approximately million of the year on year increase based on historical pro forma operating data 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in these favorable results were achieved despite the negative impact to gross margin of approximately million of outsourcing penalties associated with the capacity constraints at spinnaker coating attributable to its overall growth  in particular  the growth from two pressure sensitive postage contracts with the postal service 
in the future  these capacity constraints should be eliminated through the installation of a new silicone coater  which became fully operational in january the registrant believes that the new silicone coater will enable it to substantially reduce costs associated with its current level of outsourcing silicone liner 
in addition  results include thousand of costs associated with changes and improvements in management personnel and reductions of personnel in certain manufacturing functions as the registrant continues to focus on internal efficiencies 
income from operations 
income from operations was million or of net sales for compared to million or net sales in these operating results reflect the inclusion of central products for a full year and thousand of costs associated with changes and improvements in management personnel at spinnaker coating 
included in corporate office expenses are charges from the registrant s corporate parent  lynch corporation  for certain management fees and other direct services 
the income from operations included a charge of approximately thousand for fees paid to a consulting firm assisting spinnaker coating to improve its operations and manufacturing processes 
this consulting engagement began in and was completed in interest expense 
interest expense for totaled million  of which thousand relates to amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized in connection with the registrant s million senior notes and million revolving credit facility 
the senior notes require semi annual interest payments each april and october through maturity in october as a result of the acquisition of central products and a full year s interest accrued on the debt incurred  and higher average working capital needs from the growth of the registrant s businesses  total interest expense for increased by approximately million  versus other income expense guarantee fee 
in the first quarter of  the registrant accrued a thousand charge for guarantee fees due to lynch corporation in connection with debt incurred in the central products acquisition 
this fee is per month of the principal amount of certain indebtedness million at march  of the registrant 
the indebtedness was extinguished with the proceeds generated from the senior note issuance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the registrant donated land held in other assets to a charity in atlanta  georgia 
the book value of the land was thousand 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes is at an effective rate of 
the registrant s tax rate is impacted by permanent tax differences  primarily non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the central products acquisition amortized over years

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
extraordinary charge 
the registrant recorded a fourth quarter extraordinary charge of approximately million  net of income taxes  or a loss per share 
the charge was attributable to the extinguishment of the registrant s previously existing credit facilities and the write off of related deferred financing costs 
net income

sdw  a large pulp and paper producer  is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sappi  ltd  a public south african conglomerate 
coating maine is a wholly owned subsidiary of spinnaker coating  inc most recently known as brown bridge industries  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant and was formed to acquire the pressure sensitive business which manufactures and markets label stock primarily for the edp segment of the label stock market 
the pressure sensitive business edp products are used in various labeling end uses  including form printing and product marking and identification 
the coating maine acquisition is consistent with the registrant s long term strategy of pursuing acquisitions which complement its position in the adhesive backed materials industry 
the purchase price under the agreement was approximately million  plus the assumption of certain liabilities excluding substantially all trade payables  and was funded with approximately million from availability under the registrant s recently amended million revolving credit facility and the issuance of the note by the registrant to sdw in the original principal amount of million 
the pressure sensitive business generated million of net sales and  on a historical basis  million of ebitda as defined for the fiscal year ended october  on a pro forma basis  ebitda for the fiscal year ended october  was million  which reflects pro forma adjustments to eliminate certain allocated costs from sdw in excess of those that will be required to operate the business 
these costs included executive  legal  accounting  purchasing and other corporate overhead functions  as well as other allocated costs related to maintenance  material handling and security 
the note bears interest at the rate of 
the note includes a payment in kind pik feature that allows the registrant to pay the first year s interest payment by issuing an additional subordinated note under similar terms as the note  and the registrant may also issue such a pik note if at a future interest payment date a default or event of default exists  or would be covered by the payment of such interest in cash  under the revolving credit facility 
payments of principal and interest are subject to restrictions contained in  and in any event are junior and subordinate in right of payment to  the payment of indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the senior notes 
the note matures on january   however  it is expected to be prepaid earlier if certain conditions or events occur 
prepayments of principal of and of the original principal amount are due on march  and march   respectively  subject to there being sufficient unused availability and no existing default or event of default under the revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the coating maine acquisition  the registrant s revolving credit facility was amended to increase the aggregate facility amount to million  subject to certain variables  including inventory and receivables eligible to be included in the borrowing base 
general the registrant s principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations and availability under the amended million revolving credit facility 
the registrant has historically provided working capital  financed capital expenditures and met debt service requirements through cash flows from operations a form of self financing 
the registrant expects to continue to manage its business in this manner based upon current operations and anticipated cost savings and future growth 
the revolving credit facility is available to fund acquisitions and support periodic fluctuations in the working capital 
on march   immediately before the coating maine acquisition  there was cash and availability under the revolving credit facility of approximately million 
the registrant s ability to fund its april  senior note interest payment of approximately million is dependent upon its availability under the revolving credit facility 
the registrant anticipates having sufficient availability under the revolving credit facility based on current operations 
the senior notes are redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of the registrant on or after october   at various redemption prices beginning at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  at any time or from time to time on or prior to october   the registrant  at its option  may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with net cash proceeds from public equity offerings at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued an unpaid interest 
the senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by the subsidiaries of the registrant 
on october   concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes  the registrant acquired the approximately minority interest in its spinnaker coating subsidiary 
the terms of the spinnaker coating acquisition provided that the minority stockholders of spinnaker coating would receive an aggregate cash payment of approximately million  issuance of  shares of common stock and a right to a contingent payment 
the contingent payment is exercisable at any time from october  through september  the value of the contingent payment is equal to the percentage of the capital stock of the former spinnaker coating entity owned by such minority stockholder at the time of the merger multiplied by of the fair value of the capital stock of spinnaker coating  as determined in accordance with certain economic assumptions  as of the date such right is exercised  less the consideration received at closing 
the contingent price is payable through the issuance of common stock of the registrant  unless the registrant elects to pay the contingent price in cash 
if such payments are made in cash  they could give rise to a default under the senior notes  unless there is sufficient availability under provisions regarding restricted payments contained in the senior notes 
the registrant s december  cash balance was approximately million  which reflects the october  senior notes semi annual interest payment of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in investing activities in were primarily focused on providing increased capacity and improved manufacturing efficiencies in the registrant s tape production facilities  while investments in included a new silicone and adhesive coater for the registrant s label stock business 
in addition  in the registrant acquired its tape production facility in brighton  colorado  and funded financing costs associated with the registrant s october issuance of million of senior notes 
financing activities during generated approximately thousand  which includes the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock and  shares of class a common stock upon the exercise of warrants held by bf at a total price of thousand offset by thousand of reductions in borrowings under the revolving credit facility and thousand of payments on long term debt and capital leases 
cash generated from financing activities in included net working capital borrowings of million offset by million of deferred financing costs 
in addition  on april   the registrant issued approximately  shares of old stock upon the exercise of warrants held by bf at a total price of approximately thousand 
on january   the registrant issued  shares of common stock and  shares of class a common stock upon the exercise of the remaining class a warrants held by bf at a total price of thousand 
the amended million revolving credit facility will expire october  which is consistent with the maturity date of the original million revolver 
the registrant is charged an unused credit fee every month of per annum 
interest on outstanding borrowings bears interest at variable rates related to the prime interest rate or the lender s base rate 
at december   the interest rate in effect was 
the registrant s operating activities and available cash balances have funded interest payments of the senior notes of approximately million  the latest semi annual payment being october   and approximately million in capital investments  while revolving credit facility borrowings have declined to less than million at december  the registrant has identified possible environmental issues related to portions of its land in hamden  connecticut 
the appropriate regulatory agencies have been notified  but to date no action has been required by any regulatory agency 
the registrant continues to investigate the possibility of pursuing an offering of common stock or other equity securities 
however  there can be no assurance that an offering will be accomplished on terms satisfactory to the registrant 
year until recently  computer programs were written to store only two digits of date related information in order to more efficiently handle and store data 
as a result  these programs were unable to properly distinguish between the year and the year this is frequently referred to as the year problem 
the registrant recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
the registrant began addressing year compliance in early in conjunction with the implementation of a new management information system at spinnaker coating  a task which was successfully completed in the system implementation  which provided improved functionality and internal processing  was necessitated to transition from the former parent s information system 
central products company is in the process of implementing a new information system with significantly improved functionality which the registrant believes will also address the year computer program issue 
the registrant expects the implementation project to be completed in beginning later in  the registrant s industrial equipment manufacturer  entoleter  will begin the process of defining  assessing and converting or replacing  various programs  hardware and instrumentation systems to make them year compatible 
the registrant does not expect the year compliance to have a significant effect on operations  nor does it expect the cost to be material to the registrant s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the costs of year modifications and the date of completion will be closely monitored and are based on management s best estimates 
actual results  however  could differ from those anticipated
