inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on its net revenue or profitability 
higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured but have not had a material effect on the company s net revenue or profitability 
the company has historically been able to partially offset its cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for substantially all of its product sales and its licensing revenues 
inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk
