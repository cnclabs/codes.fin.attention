during fiscal  the company s domestic sales reflect an increasingly seasonal pattern  with more shipments occurring in the second half of the fiscal year and fewer in the off season first half since leading retailers require just in time delivery 
favorable summer weather in southern domestic markets in fiscal increased in season sales and depleted industry inventories in those markets at fiscal year end august  which positions us manufacturers for a better year in fiscal  assuming normal weather 
this follows a period affected by cool summer weather in key us markets in fiscal that increased industry inventories at some manufacturers excluding the company and at retailers at the beginning of fiscal and reduced fiscal results all year long
