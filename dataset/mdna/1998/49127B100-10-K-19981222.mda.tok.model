cost of goods sold for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold reflects the increase in shipments offset by a decrease in the per ton cost of tons shipped 
the decrease in the per ton cost of tons shipped during fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from lower conversion costs due to improvements in productivity  offset partially by an increase in scrap costs

net sales for fiscal decreased by million to million from million for fiscal due to a decline in shipments 
total shipments for fiscal were approximately  tons  down from fiscal  while the average selling price per ton remained constant with the prior year 
the decline in shipments primarily resulted from the third quarter shutdown caused by a radioactive contamination of the baghouse  continued start up of the ladle metallurgy facility during the first half of fiscal  and a ten day melt shop outage in the second quarter which is discussed below 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased 
million  or  to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for fiscal to in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily due to higher conversion costs and additional depreciation  partially offset by a decrease in material costs 
conversion costs for fiscal were adversely impacted by lower production during the third quarter due to the twelve day shutdown of the melt shop operations required to decontaminate the baghouse facilities following detection of a radioactive substance in the baghouse dust and by the shut down and restart of the caster during the second quarter 
the caster was also shut down for repairs for days in late december and early january 
during this day shut down  the company converted an additional caster strand to allow for increased production of thicker  wider products 
the resulting shortage of billets idled the rolling mill for several days and negatively impacted rolling mill production and productivity 
to a lesser degree  conversion costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in repair  maintenance and supply costs  health benefit costs and the continued start up phase of the new ladle metallurgy facility in the first half of fiscal the cost of goods sold for fiscal includes a million reimbursement from business interruption insurance  related to a caster fire 
the fiscal year includes a million reimbursement from business interruption insurance related to the decontamination of the baghouse in the calculation of cost of goods sold

management has considered the levels of currently anticipated pre tax income in assessing the required level of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
taking into consideration historical pre tax income levels  the nature of certain events which adversely affected operations in fiscal and  the company s return to profitability during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued improvement in productivity and other factors  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset  after consideration of the valuation allowance which has been established  will be realized

fiscal operating cash flows reflect net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and the decrease in net deferred tax asset of million 
operating cash flows were negatively impacted by a million increase in inventories 
the increase in inventories is primarily attributed to an increase in finished goods inventory offset somewhat by a decrease in scrap inventory 
the increase in finished goods inventory is due to lower than anticipated fourth quarter shipments in fiscal and lower than normal inventories in fiscal due to production problems

year compliance the following year discussion is provided in response to the securities and exchange commission s recent interpretative statement expressing its view that public companies should include detailed discussion of year issues in their md a 
the company is currently assessing the issues confronting it related to the year problem  which is the result of the inability of many computer systems and electronic equipment to distinguish the year from the year the company is following an organized program to assure the company s information technology systems and related infrastructure will be year compliant 
the company has divided its year issues into three areas including computer hardware and software business systems  manufacturing processing control devices and related systems  and facility support systems 
the company s year program includes three phases an audit and assessment phase designed to identify year issues  a modification phase designed to correct year issues this phase includes testing of individual modifications as they are installed  and a testing phase to test entire systems for year compliance after individual modifications have been installed and tested 
the company has completed the audit and assessment phase for both the computer hardware and software business systems and the facility support systems 
the company currently expects that the audit and assessment phase for the manufacturing process control devices and related systems will be completed by december  the company is currently performing the second phase of its program including modification and testing of individual modifications on its computer hardware and software business systems 
the company expects to complete the second phase of its program for these business systems by december  the company also expects to conduct final testing of its business systems in the first calendar quarter of the company currently expects to complete modification and testing of its manufacturing control devices and related systems by the first calendar quarter of after all modifications have been made  appropriate testing of the system will be performed prior to june  management has estimated that the cost for correction of year issues  including any software and hardware changes and the cost of personnel involved in working on the project  will be approximately  the company estimates that of the total cost has been spent to date 
the year updates are being funded out of funds generated from operations and account for less than of the company s information technology budget 
the company s year program includes investigation of the year readiness status of our major vendors and customers 
the company is using letters  questionnaires and protocols to determine its vendors and customers readiness 
the company has contacted all major vendors including energy and scrap suppliers and external service providers including banks  insurance companies and phone service providers to determine their year compliance status 
if any such vendor indicates that they will not be year compliant  the company will develop contingency plans to address the issue  which may include identifying and developing other vendors 
the company has also contacted significant customers to determine their progress towards year compliance and to identify issues  if any  which might develop if a customer is unable to become year compliant on a timely basis 
if any issues are identified  the company expects to develop procedures to permit the company to continue to supply the customer despite year issues 
the company does not have a contingency plan to operate in the event that its business systems are not year compliant 
as our work progresses  if testing scheduled for the first calendar quarter of suggests that there is a significant risk that the business systems might not be year compliant  a contingency plan will be developed 
impact of inflation and changing prices while the company has not experienced any material long term adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  margins have been affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are steel scrap  labor  and energy  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
scrap costs are frequently influenced by supply and demand factors as well as general economic conditions 
in contrast  finished product prices are influenced by nationwide economic trends and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price increases  the effect of steel imports  market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to increase prices 
see business employees  competition and other market factors  raw materials and manufacturing operation 
forward looking statements the matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this report on form k that are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the reliance on truck and utility vehicle industry  excess industry capacity  product demand and industry pricing  volatility of raw material costs  especially steel scrap  intense foreign and domestic competition  management s estimates of niche market data  the cyclical and capital intensive nature of the industry  and cost of compliance with environmental regulations 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from those projected or implied by such forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  various statements in the previous discussion of year are likewise forward looking statements 
these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include the inability of the company to complete the plans and modifications that it has identified  the failure of software vendors to deliver the upgrades and repairs to which they have committed  the wide variety of information technology systems and components  both hardware and software  that must be evaluated and the large number of vendors and customers with which the company interacts 
the company s assessments of the effects of year on the company are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and the company s reasonable reliance on that information 
therefore  the risk that inaccurate information is supplied by third parties upon which the company reasonably relied must be considered as a risk factor that might affect the company s year efforts 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests
