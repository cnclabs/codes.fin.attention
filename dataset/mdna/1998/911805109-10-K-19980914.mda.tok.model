liquidity and capital resources at may  working capital increased by  during fiscal to  at may  from  as of may  the primary components of the increase are increases in cash and cash equivalents  litigation settlement receivable  and accounts receivable from affiliates of   and  respectively 
these increases in working capital were offset by increases in accounts payable  the deferred gmmv purchase option and the current portion of long term debt of   and  respectively 
cash increased due to the reconsolidation of sutter gold mining company sgmc which resulted in increased cash of  and  from the sale of the company s common stock 
these receipts of cash were used primarily in mine development of  purchases of equipment of  increased investment in affiliates of  and cash used in operations 
during the fourth quarter of the company and crested were able to negotiate a settlement of certain of the issues in the sheep mountain partners smp arbitration with nukem and cric which resulted in settlement proceeds to the company and crested of  the increase in accounts receivable affiliates is primarily the result of the company advancing funds for crested in the various ventures in which the companies participate and advances that the company and crested made on behalf of yellow stone fuels corp 
accounts payable increased due to the increased activity of the green mountain mining venture gmmv where the company and crested acted as the operator for the development of the two decline tunnels to access the uranium mineralized material on green mountain 
the current portion of long term debt increased as a result of a balloon payment coming due on one of the company s long term notes payable 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company and crested entered into an acquisition agreement with kennecott to acquire kennecott s interest in the gmmv 
as part of that agreement kennecott paid the company and crested  upon execution which is recorded as a deferred purchase option 
if the company and crested are successful in closing the acquisition agreement and purchasing kennecott s interest in gmmv  the  will be considered a component ie  a reduction of the acquisition purchase price of  please see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company and crested are not able to close the acquisition agreement  the  will be applied against any future reimbursable costs contributions due the gmmv 
after these costs and any remaining obligations are satisfied  the remainder  if any  will be recognized as income 
investments in affiliates decreased by  primarily as a result of reconsolidating sgmc and equity losses from affiliates of  and  respectively 
restricted investments increased as a result of an investment by sgmc in a non affiliated company for  and the increase of the certificates of deposit held by plateau resources ltd 
plateau of  for future reclamation expenses as a result of earned interest 
during the year ended may   property plant and equipment increased by  this increase was primarily as a result of reconsolidating sgmc of  development of mining properties of  and the acquisition of equipment of  the majority of these development and equipment purchase expenses benefitted the gmmv and sgmc properties 
there were also capital expenditures made to keep the mill facility owned by plateau in standby status 
notes receivable from employees decreased by  as the company s chairman retired  of obligations to the company and crested 
notes receivable other decreased by  primarily as a result of silva production ab paying its second installment of  plus interest on the note due the company for the purchase of the brunton company in fiscal deposits and other increased by  primarily as a result of  shares of company common stock being issued to executive officers of the company under the stock award program 
such shares are retained by the company until the executive retires and are forfeitable under certain conditions 
capital resources general the primary source of the company s capital resources for fiscal will be cash on hand at may   equity financing for affiliated companies  and the expected final resolution of the smp arbitration 
additionally  the company and crested will continue to offer for sale various non core assets such as lots and homes in ticaboo  real estate holdings in wyoming  colorado and utah and mineral interests 
interest  rentals of real estate holdings and equipment  aircraft chartering and aviation fuel sales also will provide cash 
line of credit the company and crested have a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is secured by various real estate holdings and equipment belonging to the company and crested 
this facility is currently available to the company 
it is anticipated that this line of credit may be used to finance working capital needs as well as the purchase of uranium to deliver against a smp delivery contract that the company and crested recently received as a partial settlement of certain smp arbitration matters 
financing equity financing for sgmc and plateau are dependant on the market price of gold and uranium  among other things 
at may   the prices for these metals were depressed and it is not known when they will recover  if at all 
management of the company and crested believe  based on independent projections  that the market prices for these metals will improve in the short term 
no assurance can be given that the prices will improve during fiscal if the prices do not improve  the ability of the company and crested to raise equity financing for these subsidiaries will be impaired 
the company believes that cash on hand  in addition to its line of credit and cash projected to be received from operations will be adequate to fund working capital requirements through fiscal however  these capital resources may not be sufficient to provide the funding for major capital expansions of the company s mineral properties and  accordingly  the company s development plans may be either temporarily or permanently impacted 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended may  of  was primarily the result of issuances of the company s common stock 
capital requirements general the primary requirements for the company s working capital during fiscal are expected to be the costs associated with development activities of plateau  care and maintenance costs of the former smp properties  payments of holding fees for mining claims  purchase of uranium for delivery to the utility contract that was distributed to the company and crested as a result of the settlement agreement reached regarding the smp arbitration  the company s portion of the costs associated with the gmmv properties and corporate general and administrative expenses 
sgmc effective april   the company purchased  special warrant units from certain canadian investors in an arm s length  bargained transaction between unrelated entities 
as consideration  the units were purchased with  shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction resulted in the company increasing its ownership to of the outstanding common stock of sgmc as of may  from at may  due primarily to the sustained decline in gold prices  the company recorded a  impairment on its investment in sgmc 
if financing is not obtained in fiscal and or gold prices further decline from present levels  the company will reevaluate the need for an additional impairment on its investment in sgmc  which includes the stock purchase warrant that is contingent on sgmc identifying ounces of gold in excess of  ounces 
the company acknowledges that it may be required to record a significant impairment under generally accepted accounting principles should financing not be obtained by sgmc to develop the project or if gold prices decline further 
sgmc s properties contain reserves of gold 
preliminary estimates are that a ton per day tpd mine mill operation using a cyanide flotation process  will require up to  to place the proposed mine and mill into full operation 
it is the company s intent to complete the necessary financing to develop the reserves of sgmc 
management believes that if adequate funding is obtained  production will begin in fiscal sgmc is currently attempting to negotiate financing with an investment firm with a proposed plan for the necessary financing intended to be completed in fiscal sufficient capital resources are available to sgmc to continue its permitting and capital raising activities 
smp as part of a settlement agreement reached during the fourth quarter of fiscal regarding the smp arbitration  the smp mines and associated properties were transferred to the company and crested 
all past holding costs of the smp mines were resolved and the future costs of standby as well as reclamation are the obligation of the company and crested 
these costs are estimated at approximately  per month 
there are no current plans to mine the smp crooks gap properties during fiscal however  the company and crested will continue to preserve the mineral properties and develop concepts to reduce care and maintenance costs 
all matters in the smp arbitration have been settled with the exception of two issues that are currently before the th circuit court of appeals 
oral arguments are scheduled on these issues for september  management of the company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this hearing but believes that the issues will be resolved during fiscal unless nukem and cric elect to appeal the decision further to the us supreme court and that court decides to hear the appeal 
gmmv on june   use and usecc signed an acquisition agreement with kennecott for the right to acquire kennecott s interest in the gmmv for  and other consideration 
as discussed in note f to the financial statements  kennecott paid the company million upon execution of the agreement  which became nonrefundable upon the satisfaction of certain terms 
the million is classified as a deferred purchase option since it will be recorded as a reduction of the company s purchase price if the acquisition agreement closes 
during july  the gmmv management committee unanimously agreed to place the jackpot mine and sweetwater mill on active standby status 
this decision was made as a result of uncertainties in the short term uranium market 
these same uncertainties have made the financing of the acquisition of kennecott s interest in gmmv more difficult 
the company continues in its financing activities in an effort to raise sufficient capital to acquire the kennecott interest in the gmmv 
currently  it is believed that such financing efforts may not be concluded by the terms of the acquisition agreement with kennecott 
kennecott continues to work with the company in its efforts to successfully close the purchase of kennecott s interest 
the standby costs of the gmmv mine  associated property and mill will eventually become the responsibility of the individual partners on a percentage ownership basis 
the partners in the gmmv are currently discussing how to operate and fund the operations of the properties 
budgets have not been finalized  but it is projected the annual holding costs of the mine and mill will be approximately  the company and crested will be obligated to pay their share of these costs once the obligations of kennecott are completely satisfied 
due to the unpredictability of the uranium market  the company is unable to predict when the gmmv properties will again be put on an active basis or when or if it will be able to purchase kennecott s interest in the gmmv 
plateau plateau owns and operates the ticaboo townsite  motel  convenience store and restaurant 
the operations resulted in fiscal losses of  which were absorbed by the company 
the company continues to work on methods of increasing revenues and reducing costs 
there has been an annual growth in sales since the company has owned plateau 
the company has constructed a total of seven homes which are held for sale 
during fiscal  the homes were written down by  to the appraised value 
the company is currently working to obtain the necessary permits from the nrc and state of utah to place the shootaring mill which is owned by plateau and located in southern utah into production 
the company is seeking debt or equity financing of between  to  to put the mill and tony m 
mine into production 
until such time as the financing is obtained and profitable contracts are obtained  the company will not put the properties into production 
yellow stone fuels corp 
ysfc in management s opinion  ysfc has sufficient cash to complete its projected exploration program on its in situ uranium properties 
at may   ysfc owed the company and crested  on a convertible promissory note plus  in interest for a total of  the note bears interest at per annum and is due in december ysfc also owed the company and crested  for miscellaneous payroll and operating expenses 
ysfc has indicated its desire to pay the total indebtedness in cash but it is not certain that a cash payment will occur as ysfc may elect at its option to pay the promissory note with shares of its common stock 
term debt and other obligations debt at may  of  constitutes a relatively low percentage of capitalization given the value of assets owned by the company and the various activities it participates in 
the debt is primarily for property and equipment purchased by usecc  sutter and fng 
the debt bears different interest rates and is due under various payment terms 
it is anticipated that all debt payments will be able to be made in the normal course of the company s business 
reclamation obligations it is not anticipated that any of the company s working capital will be used in fiscal for the reclamation of any of its mineral properties 
the reclamation costs are long term and are either bonded through the use of cash bonds or the pledge of assets 
it is not anticipated that any of the company s mining properties will enter the reclamation phase prior to may  prior to fiscal  the company and crested assumed the reclamation obligations  environmental liabilities and contingent liabilities for employee injuries  from mining the crooks gap and other properties in the sheep and green mountain mining districts as well as the sgmc properties 
the reclamation obligations  which are established by government agencies  were most recently set at  for the smp properties and  on the sgmc properties 
the amount of accruals for environmental liabilities for each site are determined by estimating costs associated with current or expected reclamation and remediation plans 
these plans include detailed descriptions of the work to be performed  and in many cases involve the work of third party consultants 
the plans are submitted annually to government agencies who review them and set the bond amounts 
to assure the reclamation work will be performed  regulatory agencies require posting of a bond or other security 
the company and crested satisfied this requirement with respect to smp properties by mortgaging their executive office building in riverton  wyoming 
reclamation obligations on the gmmv big eagle properties and the sweetwater mill  estimated at approximately  have been assumed by the gmmv venturers  and secured by a bank letter of credit provided by kennecott 
the reclamation and environmental costs associated with the sweetwater mill will not commence prior to conclusion of mining activities on green mountain except for the open pit mine near the mill 
as uranium is processed through the mill  a reclamation reserve will be funded on the unit of production basis 
up to  in dollars in any reclamation costs on the sweetwater mill and associated properties which may be incurred prior to commencement of production or will be loaned by unocal to the gmmv to be repaid only out of production 
reclamation obligations of plateau are covered by a  cash bond at may  to the us nuclear regulatory commission and a  cash deposit as of may  for the resolution of any environmental or nuclear claims 
other although the company and crested currently are not in production on any mineral properties  development work continues on several of their major investments 
the company and crested are not using hazardous substances or known pollutants to any great degree in these activities 
consequently  recurring costs for managing hazardous substances  and capital expenditures for monitoring hazardous substances or pollutants have not been significant 
likewise  the company and crested do not have properties which require current remediation 
the company and crested are also not aware of any claims for personal injury or property damages that need to be accrued or funded 
the tax years through may  are closed after audit by the irs 
the company currently has filed a request for an appeal hearing on an irs agent s findings for the years ended may  and although all indicators are that the findings of the irs audit for and will not result in additional tax  the findings of the audit could affect the tax net operating loss of the company 
management of the company feels confident that it will prevail on a majority of the issues 
no assurance of the outcome of the appeal can be given 
the tax years ended may  and are also currently being audited by the irs 
no determination on these audits can be made as they are not yet completed 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal operations resulted in a net after tax loss of  or per share as compared to a net after tax loss of  or per share 
the primary cause of this reduction in the company s loss during fiscal were increased revenues of  while costs and expenses only increased by net cash used in operating activities decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the decrease in loss from operations offset by other working capital changes 
revenues mineral revenues increased by  as the result of the company receiving its proportionate share of the net proceeds from the delivery of pounds of uranium under an smp contract 
this was the last delivery under this contract and no similar delivery proceeds were received during fiscal commercial operations revenue increased by  as a result of an increase of  pertaining to increased equipment rentals to the gmmv and the development of mining properties 
additionally  revenues generated at the company s ticaboo townsite increased by  in fiscal smp litigation settlements are recorded net of any accounts receivable from smp for holding costs of the mining properties 
during fiscal  such revenues increased by a net of  to  construction contract revenues decreased by  as a result of the company s subsidiary four nines gold  inc fng not obtaining any commercial construction contracts 
fng s equipment and employees were used exclusively during fiscal on the construction of various roads  ponds and other excavation projects for the gmmv 
revenues from management fees increased significantly due to the work that was done under the gmmv agreements that allow the company to receive a management fee on all billable charges under the gmmv agreement 
costs and expenses mineral operation expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by  and  respectively due to increased operations at the company s gmmv and plateau mineral and commercial operations  and increased salary expense 
the company recognized a mineral interest impairment of  pertaining to sgmc as discussed above 
there was no impairment of mineral properties taken during fiscal there was however an abandonment of mining claims in pertaining to certain mining claims in the amount of  no abandonments of mining claims occurred in fiscal construction costs decreased by  due to fng not performing any commercial construction work  and provision for doubtful accounts decreased by  as no additional provision was required 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the twelve months ended may  totaled  as compared to revenues at may  of  this decrease in revenues of  is primarily the result of no revenues being recognized from mineral sales in fiscal decrease of 
during the prior year  use and crested made certain deliveries of uo for smp 
other decreases in revenues were oil sales   sales of assets   and construction revenues from use s subsidiary fng   these decreases in revenues were offset by increased commercial sales   advance royalties from cyprus amax   partial distribution of smp funds   and increased management fees and other revenues   with the exception of cost of minerals sold  construction costs and commercial operations  costs and expenses remained the same as they had been in cost of minerals sold declined by  as a result of crested and use not delivering any uo under the smp contracts during fiscal construction costs declined by  as a result of use s subsidiary fng not being able to secure construction contracts 
currently  fng is using its equipment and employees on the construction of earth structures and roads for the gmmv 
it is not known if fng will be able to obtain contracts in the future 
during fiscal  use also recognized a provision for doubtful accounts of  this is as a result of a third party defaulting on a sale of land that use and crested sold during a prior period 
use also recognized an increase in the abandonment of mineral leases of  the total expense of  for mineral property abandonment was the result of crested abandoning a mineral property having a book value of  and sgmc abandoning properties with a book value of  general and administrative expenses increased only slightly by  due to expansion of operations 
increases in general and administrative expenses were reduced by overhead and direct charges to gmmv  smp and sgmc 
equity losses recognized by use increased by  operations resulted in a net loss of  or per share in as compared to a net profit of  or per share in future operations the company has generated losses in two of the last three years  as a result of holding costs and permitting activities in the mineral segment along with impairments of mining claims and investments in subsidiaries that are involved in the minerals business and from certain commercial operations 
the company is in the process of developing and or holding investments in gold and uranium properties that are currently not generating any operating revenues 
these properties require expenditures for items such as permitting  development  care and maintenance  holding fees  corporate overhead and administrative expenses 
success in the minerals industry is dependant on the price that a company can receive for the minerals produced 
the company cannot predict what the long term price for gold and uranium will be and therefore cannot predict when  or if  the company will generate net income from operations 
in addition  legal expenses associated with the litigation and arbitration surrounding the smp partnership and the inability of the company to utilize all the funds that have been awarded to the company and crested by the arbitration panel and confirmed by the federal court have compounded the company s operating and cash flow position in the past 
the company believes that the smp arbitration will be resolved during fiscal the company believes that it will meet its obligations in fiscal as well as be able to secure financing to further the development of its mineral properties and place them into production 
year issue computer programs written in the past utilize a two digit format to identify the applicable year 
any date sensitive software beyond december  could fail  if not modified 
the result could be  among other possibilities  disruptions to operations and the inability to process financial transactions 
the company has evaluated the operating systems on all headquarter and field office computers and operating systems and has consulted with various vendors of the computer software which is being used by the company and affiliates 
the vendors have confirmed to the company that all of the company s software and information systems are year compliant 
the company therefore does not believe that significant expenditures will be required for the year event 
effects of changes in prices mining operations and the acquisition  development and sale of mineral properties are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous 
conversely  a price decline facilitates acquisitions of properties containing that mineral  but makes sales of such properties more difficult 
operational impacts of changes in mineral commodity prices are common in the mining industry 
uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold affect use to the greatest extent 
when uranium prices were relatively high in fiscal  use and crested acquired the crooks gap properties  and thereafter put the properties into production 
when uranium prices fell sharply during fiscal  usecc suspended the mining operations of smp  because uranium could be purchased at prices less than the costs of producing uranium 
uranium production in the united states reportedly fell by percent to percent in  due to the lowest prices for uranium since the market developed in the s 
however  these low prices created opportunities for the acquisition of the sweetwater mill and the shootaring mill 
changes in uranium prices directly affect the profitability of uranium supply agreements with utilities 
fixed price agreements become advantageous when the spot market price for uranium falls significantly below the price which a utility has agreed to pay 
several of the original smp utility contracts have been completed  and the rest assigned out to the partners in connection with the partial settlement of litigation with nukem cric 
for fiscal  use and crested have one utility supply contract  which is market related  and one purchase contract  which is market related 
however  the purchase contract requires six months notice to the supplier before delivery  which notice fixes the price 
a price decline between notice and delivery could adversely impact use and crested 
additional contracts with utilities will be sought as the uranium properties of use and crested go into production 
use believes sgmc s lincoln mine will be profitable with gold prices over per ounce 
the price of gold was adversely impacted in october and november and prices in late july were approximately per ounce 
molybdenum and oil 
changes in prices of molybdenum and petroleum are not expected to materially affect use with respect to either its molybdenum advance royalties or its fees associated with oil production 
a significant and sustained increase in demand for molybdenum would be required for the development mt 
emmons properties by cyprus amax since cyprus amax has other producing mines
