the company provides high volume turnkey manufacturing services using surface mount technology for leading electronics oems in the communications  personal computer  peripherals  consumer and automotive industries 
in turnkey manufacturing  unlike manufacturing on consignment  the company is responsible for procuring the components utilized in the manufacturing process 
the component procurement responsibility requires the company to provide significant working capital  materials management  purchasing  receiving inspection and stockroom management 
this approach transfers the economic risks of materials cost fluctuations  excess scrap and inventory obsolescence to the company 
the company believes that turnkey manufacturing generates higher net revenue than consignment manufacturing due to the generation of revenue from materials as well as labor and manufacturing overhead  but also results in lower gross margins than consignment manufacturing because the company generally realizes lower gross margins on materials based revenue than on manufacturing based revenue 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors 
the primary factors affecting operating results are the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in materials costs and the mix of materials costs versus labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design changes  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
in the past  changes in orders from customers have had a significant effect on results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
other factors affecting the company s annual and quarterly operating results include price competition  the company s level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  the degree of automation used in the assembly process  the efficiencies achieved by the company in managing inventories and fixed assets  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor and selling  general and administrative expenses also affect operating results 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of lower volume production  jabil generally has idle capacity and reduced operating margins 
the company has continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of its net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of the company s large customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the past  some of the company s customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangement with the company  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from the company 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with the company or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from the company 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition

foreign source revenue represented of net revenue for fiscal and of net revenue for fiscal foreign source revenue in represented of net revenue 
gross margin cost of revenue includes the cost of materials and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  as well as provisions for excess and obsolete inventory adjustments 
the company s various customers typically require different manufacturing services 
different manufacturing services have different gross margins depending upon i the mix of materials costs versus manufacturing costs  and ii the company s experience in manufacturing a particular product 
the company typically realizes better gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than it does on materials based revenue  and better gross margins on manufacturing services for products with which it has more experience due to the increased efficiencies achieved over time 
gross margins also fluctuate due to changes in materials costs 
gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal due to a shift toward manufacturing based revenues and increased capacity utilization 
in fiscal and the portion of manufacturing based revenue was significantly higher than in fiscal manufacturing based revenue was the largest impact on the gross margin percentage 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million of net revenue in fiscal to million of net revenue in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased staffing and related departmental expenses at all the company s locations along with investments in information systems staff to support the expansion of the company s business

see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that current cash balances  available borrowings  and funds provided by operations will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements for at least the next months 
year readiness the company is aware of and is addressing the year issue 
the year issue creates risks for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the company deals 
failure of the company s and or third parties computer systems  manufacturing equipment and control systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
the company is actively taking steps to ensure that its global information technology infrastructure and business system applications  manufacturing equipment and systems will be year compliant while seeking adequate assurances from third parties with whom the company conducts business with  that any such systems shall be year compliant 
a global team  overseen by a corporate officer  has been formed and has implemented a proactive multi phase approach  which includes assessing the scope of work  prioritizing  certifying compliance  and testing compliance 
as of the end of fiscal the company was substantially complete in its compliance certification process of its global information technology infrastructure 
most of the company s global business systems are currently being replaced by a year compliant application  this process is expected to be complete by january  as a contingency  however  legacy systems have been upgraded to be year compliant and are in the process of being tested 
as of the end of fiscal manufacturing and test equipment and local plant business systems had been identified and prioritized in terms of year compliance with focus now on compliance certification 
it is anticipated that of all equipment and systems will be certified as compliant by the end of calendar  with the remaining by the end of the first calendar quarter of  at which time compliance testing and verification will commence 
the company is also in the process of assessing its suppliers 
the initial phase of the assessment is expected to be complete by the end of calendar early in calendar  the company anticipates validating its suppliers representations where deemed appropriate  and will develop sourcing contingency plans in areas where the company assesses that supplier readiness is insufficient 
the company estimates the cost to complete its remediation to be approximately million 
the company is unable to fully determine the effect of failure of its own systems or those of third parties with which it does business  but any significant failures could have an material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
factors affecting future results variability of operating results the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors 
the primary factors affecting operating results are the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in materials costs and the mix of materials costs versus labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the level and timing of orders placed by customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
in the past  changes in orders from customers have had a significant effect on results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
other factors affecting the company s annual and quarterly operating results include price competition  the company s level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  the degree of automation used in the assembly process  the efficiencies achieved by the company in managing inventories and fixed assets  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
any one of these factors or a combination thereof could adversely affect the company s annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on a limited number of customers for the fiscal year ended august   the company s three largest customers accounted for approximately of net revenue and fewer than customers accounted for substantially all net revenue 
cisco systems  inc cisco  com corporation com  and hewlett packard company hewlett packard  accounted for approximately   of net revenue  respectively 
the company expects to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of its net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of the company s large customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the past  some of the company s customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangement with the company  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from the company 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with the company or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from the company 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 
limited availability of components substantially all the company s net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which the company provides both materials procurement and assembly 
in turnkey manufacturing  the company typically bears the risk of component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross profit margins 
almost all the products manufactured by jabil require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times there have been industry wide shortages of electronic components  particularly memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced significant levels of short term interruption of the company s operations in the past 
there can be no assurance that such shortfalls will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business components 
dependence on certain industries the company is dependent upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of its customers  which are in turn substantially dependent on the growth of the communications  personal computer  peripherals  consumer and automotive industries 
these industries have been characterized by rapid technological change  short product life cycles and have pricing and margin pressures 
in addition  many of the company s customers in these industries are affected by general economic conditions 
the factors affecting the communications  personal computer  peripherals  consumer and automotive industries in general  and or the company s customers in particular  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 
variability of customer requirements and customer financing the level and timing of sales to a customer of the company varies due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design changes  changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers and variation in demand for its products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions or general economic conditions 
due in part to these factors  most of the company s customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
the company s inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  the company has been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers 
anticipated orders from many of the company s customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in the customer s business needs  thereby adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
on other occasions  customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on the company s resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the past  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such effects in the future 
in addition  the company generates significant accounts receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to its customers 
if one or more of the company s customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by the company  the company s operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
management of growth the company has experienced a period of rapid growth which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on the company s management  operational and financial resources 
the company s ability to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems  to develop the management skills of its managers and supervisors  and to train  motivate and manage its employees 
the company s failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition competition in the contract manufacturing industry is intense 
the company competes against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  including sci systems  inc  solectron corporation  celestica  inc  and flextronics international 
in addition  the company may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  contract manufacturing services 
most of the company s competitors have international operations and some have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
the company also faces competition from the manufacturing operations of its current and potential customers  which are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of using external manufacturers 
see business competition 
technological change and process development the market for the company s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the company is continually evaluating the advantages and feasibility of new manufacturing processes  such as tape automated bonding  chip on board and thin substrate processes 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon its ability to develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs  maintain technological leadership and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s process development efforts will be successful 
see business technology and research and development 
dependence on key personnel the company s continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees 
although to date the company has been successful in retaining key managerial and technical employees  the loss of services of certain of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business will also depend upon its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company does not have employment agreements or noncompetition agreements with its key employees 
environmental compliance the company is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process 
although the company is currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental regulations  any failure by the company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require the company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expense to comply with environmental regulations 
see business environmental 
control by existing stockholders officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates own approximately of the company s common stock outstanding 
consequently  the officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates have significant influence over the election of jabil s directors  determine the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  and otherwise control the business of the company 
possible volatility of stock price the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  general conditions in the contract manufacturing  communications  personal computer  peripherals  consumer or automotive industries and other factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations that affect the market price for many high technology companies in particular  and that often are unrelated to operating performance 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
interest rate sensitivity the company s private placement  senior notes carry a fixed interest rate of  thus the company is not subject to market risk from this debt instrument 
the company pays interest on its outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility at the london interbank offering rate libor in effect at the loan inception date plus a factor of to depending on the company s funded debt to capitalization ratios 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an adverse change in the libor rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
international expansion a key element in the company s strategy is to provide localized production of the global products produced for oems in the major consuming regions of the european community and asia 
in order to offer this localized production  in fiscal the company established a manufacturing facility in livingston  scotland  which began volume production in may the scotland facility targets existing european customers  those north american customers having significant sales in the european community and potential european customers who meet the profile discussed above 
additionally  the company began volume production in october  in penang  malaysia 
this location enables the company to provide manufacturing services to the asian market from an asian location in order to reduce costs  freight and duties  to provide a more competitive cost structure for these markets and to serve as a low cost manufacturing source for new and existing customers 
in order to increase capacity both in the european and in the asian markets  the company completed an expansion of both locations in the early portion of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as an addition to the north american market  the company completed construction of a manufacturing facility in guadalajara  mexico and began volume production early in fiscal this operation will allow for continued expansion in north america  while providing a competitive cost structure and close proximity to the united states market 
in august  the company acquired manufacturing operations in bergamo  italy as part of its acquisition of certain manufacturing and related assets comprising the hp acquisition 
the company s international operations may be subject to a number of other risks  including fluctuations in the value of currencies  export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas  restrictions on the transfer of funds  employee turnover  work stoppages  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  net operating losses incurred by foreign operations cannot be utilized by the company to reduce us income taxes 
computer integration the company is in the process of installing a new enterprise resource planning system erp system that will replace the current manufacturing resource planning mrp system and financial information systems 
this system is believed to be year compliant 
the company is also identifying and implementing changes to its other information systems in order to make them year compliant 
while the company currently expects that the year will not pose significant operational problems  delays in the implementation of new information systems  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information  and unanticipated increases in costs
