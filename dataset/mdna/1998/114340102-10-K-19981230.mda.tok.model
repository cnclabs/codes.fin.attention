precautionary statements made herein should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
overview the predecessor of brooks automation  inc the company was organized in february and acquired the semiconductor wafer handling business of the brooks automation division of aeronca electronics  inc  a subsidiary of fleet aerospace corporation  in march the company and its predecessors have been in the semiconductor wafer handling business since in the company introduced the family of vacuum central wafer handling systems and modules that forms the foundation of the company s current business 
in the company introduced a similar family of systems and modules for flat panel display substrates  including a next generation magnetically driven vacuum transfer robot 
in the company acquired techware systems corporation techware  a designer and supplier of integrated equipment control software for the semiconductor and related industries  expanding its software and control capability 
in the company introduced a line of products for the atmospheric handling market  including in line and controlled environment systems  robots  aligners and traversers 
in the company acquired fastech integration  inc fastech  a designer and supplier of top to bottom integrated mes software solutions 
many of the company s customers purchase the company s vacuum transfer robots and other modules before purchasing the company s vacuum central wafer handling systems 
the company believes that once a customer has selected the company s products for a process tool  the customer is likely to rely on those products for the life of that process tool model  which can be in excess of five years 
the company s product revenues include sales of hardware and software products  the company s service revenues include revenue from maintenance contracts and fixed fee application consulting contracts 
the majority of the company s revenues have been generated by sales to customers in the united states  although the company believes that a significant portion of these customers incorporate the company s products into equipment sold to their foreign customers 
the company s foreign sales have occurred principally in japan  south korea and europe 
the company s foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of the company s international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of the company s international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent that the company expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  the company will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation 
the company s business is highly dependent upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers which historically have been cyclical  and the company s ability to develop  manufacture and sell new products and product enhancements 
the company s results will also be affected  especially when measured on a quarterly basis  by the volume  composition and timing of orders  conditions in industries served by the company  competition and general economic conditions 
results of operations impact of acquisition related  restructuring  and other charges in september the company acquired fastech in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company s historical consolidated financial statements have been restated to include fastech for all periods prior to the acquisition 
the company s results of operations for the year ended september   were significantly impacted by certain acquisition related  restructuring  and other charges 
these charges included million of inventory related costs  million of acquisition related costs  million of restructuring charges  million of accounts receivable reserves  million of additional depreciation expense and million of interest incurred on retirement of debt 
the restructuring charges include costs to terminate certain employees during fiscal under a plan approved and implemented during fiscal the following table reflects the results of operations for the three years ended september   and the effect of the acquisition related  restructuring  and other charges for the year ended september  for the year ended september  acquisition related  restructuring  as reported and other proforma as reported in thousands  except share data charges revenues product     services     total revenues     cost of revenues product   a    services     total cost of revenues      gross profit      operating expenses research and development  b    selling  general and administrative   c    acquisition related and restructuring costs   d income loss from operations     interest income   interest expense e income loss before income taxes     a includes million of inventory related charges  million of severance costs  and million of depreciation expense 
b includes million of additional depreciation expense 
c includes million of additional accounts receivable reserves  million of depreciation expense  and million of severance and other transactions related charges 
d includes million of costs to exit duplicate facilities  million of legal  accounting  and other transaction related costs  and million of severance costs 
e charges reflect interest expense incurred on retirement of debt in conjunction with the company s acquisition of fastech 
fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues total revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared with revenues in fiscal product revenues decreased million primarily as a result of decreases in flat panel display revenues and software revenues  which were partially offset by an increase in mm revenues and mm revenues 
services revenues decreased million 
the decreases in product and services revenues are primarily the result of the prolonged economic downturn currently impacting the semiconductor industry and related fabrication equipment sector 
foreign revenues for fiscal were million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers  compared with foreign revenues of million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers in the prior fiscal year 
the company expects that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that foreign revenues particularly from asia which is suffering regional economic downturns  will remain a strong component of the company s total revenues 
gross profit overall  gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of product revenues decreased to compared with for fiscal included in the cost of product revenues for fiscal were million of charges related primarily to inventory and severance costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded an inventory related charge of million to provide additional reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
these reserves reflect management s assessment of the currently required inventory reserve level in view of the decline in customer demand for semiconductor equipment due to a prolonged industry downturn 
the gross profit percentage for product revenues before these charges in fiscal was  a decrease compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of continued underutilization of manufacturing capacity due in part to customer requested shipment delays primarily in the first half of fiscal and pricing pressure from volume production customers 
in future periods  gross profit may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products sold  continued pricing pressures  or increases in cost of goods 
gross profit percentage on service revenues as a percentage of service revenues was for fiscal  as compared with for the prior year 
included in the cost of services revenues are global support costs  which decreased to million of services revenues for fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
global support costs consist primarily of personnel costs and travel expenses 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million of revenues from million of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily resulted from incremental spending associated with the launch of new atmospheric products and the transition to next generation vacuum wafer handling products  as the company continues to make investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new semiconductor and flat panel display products and software products 
the company believes that research and development expenditures are essential to maintaining its competitive position in the semiconductor and flat panel display fabrication equipment and software markets and expects these expenditure levels to continue at or above current levels in the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues for fiscal from million of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal expenses include million for additional accounts receivable reserves and increased depreciation expense 
before these charges  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues  primarily due to the worldwide expansion of the company s sales and administrative organizations during the first half of the year 
the company expects that expenditure levels to support the growth of its worldwide sales and administrative organizations will continue at or above current levels in the foreseeable future  reflecting the company s commitment to further penetrate key international markets 
acquisition related and restructuring costs in fiscal the company incurred acquisition related costs of million that consisted principally of million of costs to exit duplicate facilities  and million of legal  accounting  and other transaction related costs 
in addition  the company incurred million of severance costs in fiscal interest income and interest expense interest income increased to million for fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest income is due to higher cash and investment balances during fiscal  resulting primarily from the company s million public stock offering in september interest expense in fiscal remained relatively unchanged from million in the prior fiscal year 
interest expense in fiscal included million of acquisition related deferred financing costs due to retirement of debt in conjunction with the acquisition of fastech 
income tax provision benefit the company recorded a net tax benefit of million for fiscal  primarily due to the anticipated future tax benefit of domestic net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards generated during  which were partially offset by the million increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues total revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared with revenues in fiscal product revenues decreased million primarily as a result of a decrease in mm vacuum central wafer handling systems and components and atmospheric products  which was partially offset by an increase in mm  flat panel display  and software products 
the company attributes lower fiscal revenues to a broad decline in capital spending by the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  which adversely affected the company s revenue particularly in the first half of fiscal services revenues increased million 
foreign revenues for fiscal increased to million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers  compared with foreign revenues of million of revenues  including million of direct sales to asian customers in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in foreign revenues is primarily attributable to shipments of mm and mm central wafer handling systems and flat panel display systems to customers primarily in japan and south korea 
gross profit the overall gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of product revenues decreased to compared with for fiscal the decrease in the gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to underutilization of manufacturing capacity  higher concentration of shipments of lower gross margin platforms  and to a lesser extent  pricing pressures and higher new product introduction costs 
the gross profit percentage for service revenues was for fiscal  a decrease of from the prior year primarily due to an increase in global support costs 
global support costs increased to million of services revenues in fiscal from million of service revenues in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in global support costs resulted from the expansion of the company s global support organization in support of the international growth of its customer base 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  the company continued to make investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new semiconductor and flat panel display products and software products 
as a percentage of revenues  the increase in research and development expenses reflects the effect on the company s cost structure of the lower revenue level in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues for fiscal from million of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
interest income and interest expense interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower cash and investment balances during fiscal compared with fiscal interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense is due primarily to higher borrowings 
income tax provision benefit during fiscal  the company recorded a net tax provision of million due primarily to an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a net foreign tax provision resulting largely from the net taxable income of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
these amounts were slightly offset by the tax benefit of domestic operating loss and tax credit carrybacks 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company s principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at september  the company had working capital of million as of september   compared with million at september  in fiscal cash and cash equivalents decreased million as a result of million in cash used for investing and financing activities  partially offset by million in cash generated by operating activities and a million adjustment due to conforming the fastech fiscal year end with the company s fiscal year end 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal the company generated operating cash flow of million  despite a net loss of million for the year  as compared with million of cash used in operating activities in fiscal the improvement in operating cash flow was due primarily to changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities primarily decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  as well as adjustments for noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes  offset by a decrease in accounts payable and the net loss for the year 
the company s primary investing activities encompassed capital spending aggregating million for business information systems including computer hardware and software  as well as headquarters facility improvements 
the company expects to continue to make capital expenditures to support its business activities 
in connection with the september acquisition of fastech  the company retired million of subordinated notes with an original maturity date of june other financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity  as well as net repayments of borrowings under a domestic credit facility 
during fiscal  the company elected to terminate its primary domestic and international credit facility 
additionally  certain other domestic credit facilities expired september   and were not extended by the company 
the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances will be adequate to fund planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year readiness the year issue is the potential for system and processing failure of date related data and the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company may be affected by year issues related to noncompliant information technology it systems or non it systems operated or sold by the company or by third parties 
the company has substantially completed assessment of its internal it systems and non it systems 
at this point in its assessment  the company is not currently aware of any year problems relating to systems operated or sold by the company that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition without taking into account the company s efforts to avoid such problems 
although the company believes that its systems are year compliant  the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant 
in addition  the company s products and software are often sold to be integrated into or interfaced with third party equipment or software 
failure of third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur anticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may also be vulnerable to any failures by its major suppliers  service providers and customers to remedy their own internal it and non it system year issues which could  among other things  have a material adverse effect on the company suppliers and orders 
at this time  the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties  such as its suppliers  service providers and customers  to achieve year compliance 
moreover  such third parties  even if year compliant  could experience difficulties resulting from year issues that may affect their suppliers  service providers and customers 
as a result  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any material shipment delays from their major product suppliers or any material sales delays from its major customers due to year issues  there can be no assurance that these third parties will not experience year problems or that any problems would not have an adverse material effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
because the cost and timing of year compliance by third parties such as suppliers  service providers and customers is not within the company s control  the company cannot give any assurance with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or any potential adverse effects on the company of any failure by these third parties to achieve year compliance 
the company has no contingency plan in the event year problems relating to its operations arise 
the company s failure to develop a contingency plan could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent that the company does not identify any material non compliant it systems or non it systems operated by the company or by third parties  such as the company s suppliers  service providers and customers  the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is a systematic failure beyond the control of the company  such as a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure  or a general disruption in united states or global business activities that could result in a significant economic downturn 
the company believes that the primary business risks  in the event of such failure or other disruption  would include but not be limited to  loss of customers or orders  increased operating costs  inability to obtain inventory on a timely basis  disruptions in product shipments  or other business interruptions of a material nature  as well as claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation  or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
recently enacted accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements 
both statements are effective for the company for fiscal adoption of these statements will not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in october the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes sop  software revenue recognition 
the company will adopt sop effective october  adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal for the company and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management of the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from targets or projected results 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and market price of securities the company s operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
such factors may include the demand for semiconductors in general  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software products  the timing and size of orders from the company s customer base  the ability of the company to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  the ability of the company s competitors to obtain orders from the company s customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company and its competitors  the mix of products sold by the company  and competitive pricing pressures 
the company has historically derived a substantial portion of its quarterly and annual revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of semiconductor and flat panel display substrate handling systems  which have relatively high selling prices compared to its other products 
as a result  the precise timing of the recognition of revenue from an order for one or a small number of systems can have a significant impact on the company s total revenues and operating results for a particular period 
the company s operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected if orders for a small number of systems are canceled or rescheduled by customers or cannot be filled in time to recognize revenue during that period due to  for example  unanticipated manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance delays 
the company s expense levels are based  in large part  on the company s expectations as to future revenues and are  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenue levels fall below expectations  net income will be disproportionately and adversely affected 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s revenues and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with any degree of certainty 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  future financial condition  revenues and results of operations 
dependence on semiconductor industry the company s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is presently experiencing a period of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company s financial condition  revenues and results of operations have been materially and adversely affected by the semiconductor industry downturns and may be materially adversely affected by future downturns 
the company believes that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will occur in the future  and will result in decreased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
in addition the company believes on the basis of its experience during the course of the present downturn that its ability to reduce expenses in a future downturn will be constrained by the need for continual investment in research and development  and the need to maintain ongoing customer service and support capability 
accordingly  any downturn in the semiconductor industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  future financial condition and results of operations 
customer concentration relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
sales to the company s ten largest customers in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal accounted for   and of the company s revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  sales to lam research corporation lam  the company s largest customer in these periods  accounted for   and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the company expects that sales to lam will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s customers  including lam  generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase the company s products 
a reduction or delay in orders from lam or other significant customers  including reductions or delays due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor or flat panel display industries  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on oem customers  lengthy sales cycle the company s products are principally sold to oems  which incorporate the company s products into their equipment 
due to the significant capital commitments usually incurred by semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in their purchases of these oems equipment  these manufacturers demand highly reliable products which may require several years for oems to develop 
the company s revenues are therefore primarily dependent upon the timing and effectiveness of the efforts of its oem customers in developing and marketing equipment incorporating the company s products 
the company s new products are generally incorporated into an oem customer s process tools at the design stage 
however  customer decisions to use the company s products  which can often require significant expenditures by the company without any assurance of success  often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to achieve design wins  that the process tools manufactured by the company s customers will be introduced in a timely manner or that such systems will achieve market acceptance 
the company s or its customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of international sales and operations during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  the company derived  and of its revenues from customers located outside the united states 
the company anticipates that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues 
to support its international customers  the company maintains subsidiaries in several countries including japan  south korea  taiwan and singapore 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage these operations effectively or that the company s investment in these activities will enable it to compete successfully in international markets or to meet the service and support needs of its customers 
the company will continue to be affected  for the foreseeable future  by unstable asian economies  particularly in japan and south korea 
as a result  there are uncertainties that may affect future operations 
it is not possible to determine the future effect a continuation of the asian economic crisis may have on the company s liquidity and earnings 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s revenues and operations could be subject to certain risks  including tariffs  foreign government standards and regulations and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  currency exchange risks and exchange controls  adverse tax consequences and difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
international trade regulations  such as united states export controls  could change in the future and make it more difficult for the company to export its products to various countries 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
highly competitive industry the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that its primary competition is from integrated oems that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs in house rather than by purchasing systems or modules from an independent supplier such as the company 
many of these other potential competitors have substantially greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selling its products to oems that currently satisfy their substrate handling needs in house  regardless of the performance or the price of the company s products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that integrated oems will not begin to commercialize their handling capabilities 
competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
other technical innovations may impair the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
new products and rapid technological change the semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing industries have been characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
the company believes that these trends will continue 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products to meet customer requirements 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs and market acceptance of the company s products and its customers products 
currently  the company s major development programs include expanding its product offerings of semiconductor substrate handling systems to address emerging industry requirements for mm wafer and fourth generation flat panel substrates  as well as wafer handling systems and modules for atmospheric process tools 
in addition  the company continues to develop and enhance its mes and process control software product offerings 
there can be no assurance that the company will adjust to changing market conditions or be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology 
attraction and retention of key personnel due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its existing and new customers  the company must attract and retain highly qualified and well trained domestic and international personnel 
there are a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of its business 
risks associated with acquisitions the company completed the acquisition of fastech on september   and intends to pursue  from time to time  potential acquisitions of businesses  products  and technologies that could complement or expand the company s business 
the combination of the company and fastech will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective products  technologies  management information systems  distribution channels and key personnel  and the coordination of their sales  marketing and research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully  if at all 
if significant difficulties are encountered in the integration of the existing products or technologies or the development of new products and technologies  resources could be diverted from new product development  and delays in new product introductions could occur 
the integration of operations and technologies will require the dedication of management and other personnel which may distract their attention from the day to day business of the company  the development or acquisition of new technologies  and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities 
failure to successfully accomplish the integration and development of the two companies operations and technologies would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company currently has no commitments or agreements with respect to any material potential acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully negotiate the terms of any such acquisition  finance such acquisition or integrate such acquired businesses  products or technologies into the company s existing business and products 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business particularly in the months immediately following the acquisition of fastech could cause diversion of management s time and resources 
acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses 
if any such acquisition were to occur  there can be no assurance that  whether or not consummated  any such acquisition would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  future financial condition  and results of operations 
intellectual property protection and related contingency there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  that any patents will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
because foreign patents may afford less protection under foreign law than is available under united states patent law  there can be no assurance that any such patents issued to the company will adequately protect the company s proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or  if patents are issued to the company  design around the patents issued to the company 
others may have filed and in the future may file patent applications that are similar or identical to those of the company 
to determine the priority of inventions  the company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office that could result in substantial cost to the company 
no assurance can be given that any such patent application will not have priority over patent applications filed by the company 
the company also relies upon trade secret protection  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect its confidential and proprietary information 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or disclose such technology or that the company can meaningfully protect its trade secrets 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the semiconductor related industries 
the company had received notice from general signal corporation general signal alleging infringements of patents then owned by general signal relating to cluster tool architecture  by certain of the company s products 
the notification advised the company that general signal was attempting to enforce its rights to those patents in litigation against applied materials  inc applied materials 
according to a press release issued by applied materials  applied materials settled its litigation with general signal by acquiring ownership of five general signal patents 
although not verified  these five patents would appear to be the patents referred to by general signal in its prior notice to the company 
applied materials has not contacted the company regarding these patents 
the company has in the past been  and may in the future be  notified that it may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties 
any patent litigation would be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end users of the company s products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any such claims are asserted against the company s intellectual property rights it may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the company could decide  in the alternative to resort to litigation to challenge such claims or to design around the patented technology 
such actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price the company believes that a variety of factors could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including announcements of developments related to the company s business  quarterly fluctuations in the company s actual or anticipated operating results and order levels  general conditions in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries or the worldwide economy  announcements of technological innovations  new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  and developments in the company s relationships with its customers and suppliers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the market for shares of small capitalization and semiconductor industry related companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock of the company will not decline
