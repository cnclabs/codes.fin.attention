item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
overview since the company s inception  substantially all of the company s revenue has been generated by its satellite ground segment related operations 
contracts for these ground segment systems and networks have been in virtually all cases fixed price contracts 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omission in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since the company s business may at certain times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the period from contract award through installation of ground segment systems and networks supplied by the company generally requires from three to months 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenues  upon the achievement of certain milestones 
accordingly  most of the revenue from sales of products is typically recognized when the product is shipped  with the balance recognized at the time of acceptance by the customer 
revenues from providing services are recognized at the time the service is performed 
costs of revenues are generally recorded based on the relationship of the amount of projected final costs to the percentage of revenue recorded for the specific contract 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
costs of revenues consist primarily of the costs of purchased material  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel  living costs and subcontractor salaries 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to engineers 
the company also benefits from research and development conducted by its strategic suppliers 
see business research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with the company s management  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
the company anticipates that selling and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase during the next several years due to expected increases in personnel and expenses related to supporting the company s expanding customer base 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended year ended year ended june  june  june  percentage of total revenues revenues costs of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net loss before minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiary minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiary net loss fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues  which were primarily derived from sales of ground segment systems and networks  increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of a negotiated contract with sonangol  uee as well as an overall increase in the number of shipments and or completion of contracts as the company continued to expand its businesses 
revenues for the three month period ended june  decreased by to million from million for the same period in the previous year as a result of the decline in bookings in previous quarters as a result of the economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets 
the company expects the trend in revenues that adversely affected its results of operations for the three month period ended june  to continue to impact the company 
these trends include the difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets and the decrease in bookings received by the company from these regions 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the shipment of ground segment systems and networks 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due primarily to a significant negotiated contract with sonangol  uee  which resulted in higher gross profit margin offset in part by an increase in orders awarded through a competitive bidding process  which typically result in lower gross profit margins than negotiated contracts 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of bids and proposals prepared by the company  as well as an increase in marketing personnel from at june  to at june  selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  due to an increase in development costs associated with custom solutions 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   but decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in legal and other costs associated with operating a public company  and an increase of approximately million in personnel and related expenses to support the continued growth of the company s business 
interest income 
interest income increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of the investment of remaining net proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
netsat express 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company s consolidated consolidated subsidiary netsat express experienced an increase in revenues of approximately million to approximately million from approximately million for the year ended june  the increase resulted from the implementation of access plus services in january  an increase in the number of pc vector equipment sales and related activations 
the increase in loss from operations associated with netsat express of approximately million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the year ended june  was mainly attributable to initial start up costs associated with providing access plus and pc vector services 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues  which were derived from sales of ground segment systems and networks  increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of shipments and or completion of contracts from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit 
gross profit increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the shipment of ground segment systems and networks 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  such decrease was due primarily to an increase in orders awarded through a competitive bidding process  which typically result in lower gross profit margins than negotiated contracts and a contract awarded in the previous year with an unusually high profit margin 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the opening of marketing offices in hong kong and in atlanta  georgia  the hiring of selling and marketing personnel for netsat express  which accounted for approximately million  or  of the selling and marketing expenses for the year and the increase in the number of bids and proposals prepared by the company 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  due to a decline in development costs associated with customizable systems 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   but decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from personnel increases to service the increasing customer base for the company s ground segment business as well as the hiring of netsat express administrative personnel  which accounted for approximately million  or  of the general and administrative expenses for the year 
quarterly results the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial information for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended june  the company believes that this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the prospectus and in the opinion of management all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k

general and administrative total operating expenses loss income from operations interest income  net loss income before minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiary minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiary net loss income the company may continue to experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its results of operations  which may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of the initiation and completion of contracts  delays in the booking of new contracts  the demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of revenues between custom built satellite communications systems and networks designed for its customers and standard installations provided to its customers  the growth of demand for internet infrastructure based products and services in developing countries  the timing of significant marketing programs  the extent and timing of the hiring of additional personnel  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions in the us and abroad  such as the difficult economic conditions and currency devaluations in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the company s quarterly results 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily from the sale of equity securities and  to a lesser degree  from stockholder loans 
through june   the company raised approximately million of net proceeds through a public offering of its common stock and private offerings of its common stock and convertible preferred stock 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company received net proceeds of approximately million from sales of common stock through the company s initial public offering 
in addition  the company received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the fiscal year ended june  at june   the company had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid and other current assets of million  offset by million in accounts payable and million in accrued expenses 
the company has experienced negative cash flow from operations since its inception 
such negative cash flows were due to the net losses  increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable during the respective periods 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
management anticipates that netsat express will experience negative cash flow for at least the next months as a result of additional capital investments required for continued development of its operations in eastern europe and losses from operations 
several factors had a major effect on the company s liquidity during the fiscal year ended june  first  revenues increased substantially as a result of a significant increase in contract deliveries and completed installations 
the higher revenues increased the company s working capital needs  as accounts receivable increased by approximately million and accounts payable decreased by approximately million during the fiscal year ended june  offsetting this increase was an increase in accrued expenses of approximately million 
because the company records progress payments as an offset to inventory  the approximately million decrease in net inventory during the fiscal year is lower than might be expected based on the increased level of activity and shipments against progress payments for contracts completed a decrease of approximately million from june  to june  
inventory levels may be expected to increase as work proceeds on newly acquired and existing contracts 
the second factor affecting liquidity during the fiscal year ended june  was the company s investment activities 
the company increased its investment in its strategic suppliers by approximately million during the fiscal year and purchased approximately million in additional computer  machinery and test equipment 
in addition  the company completed renovation of its new office and assembly facility for which it spent approximately million in cash on improvements and has spent an additional million on furniture and fixtures 
the third major factor affecting liquidity was the completion of an initial public offering of common stock and the exercise of options and warrants during the fiscal year ended june  net proceeds of these transactions were approximately million leaving the company with cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year of approximately million  which does not include million of restricted cash 
the company has incurred losses since its inception and therefore has not been subject to federal income taxes 
through june   the company  for income tax purposes  has generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which may be available to reduce future taxable income and future tax liabilities 
these carryforwards expire through the tax reform act of provides for an annual limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could significantly limit the company s ability to utilize these carryforwards 
the exercise of options or warrants or in connection with future sales of equity could limit the company s ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities 
additionally  because the united states tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  the company may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
the company has a million credit facility consisting of a million secured domestic line of credit and a million secured export import guaranteed line of credit 
each line of credit bears interest at the prime rate plus per annum and is collateralized by a first security interest on all assets 
the company s future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the extent to which it is able to locate additional strategic suppliers in whose technology it wishes to invest  the success of the company s marketing efforts in both the satellite ground segment and internet services fields  the demand  nature and timing of customer orders and the extent to which it must conduct research and development efforts internally 
based on current plans  the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for at least the next months 
risk factors limited operating history  history of operating losses and accumulated deficit the company  which was formed in august  has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company can be based and has incurred significant operating losses since its inception 
the company has financed its operations to date primarily from the sale of equity securities and  to a lesser degree  from stockholder loans 
the company generated its first revenue from its ground segment systems and networks business in june and has generated only minimal revenues from its satellite delivered data communications services business  which commenced operations in july the company incurred operating losses of million  million  million and million during the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively and may incur further operating losses as it attempts to expand its business 
the company s ability to expand its business and generate additional revenues and future positive operating and net income is dependent  in large part  on its ability to obtain new contracts and the profitability of such contracts  and there can be no assurance that the company will generate significant additional revenues or report quarterly or annual positive operating or net income 
as of june   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
inherent risk of international operations most of the company s revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
the company anticipates that foreign sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues in the foreseeable future 
the company s foreign sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
consequently  the decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  such as the currency devaluations in the pacific rim region  russia and other international currencies  has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the demand for the company s products and services by increasing the price of the company s products and services in the currency of the countries in which they are sold 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities include various and changing regulatory requirements  costs and risks of relying upon local subcontractors for the installation of its ground segment systems and networks  increased sales and marketing expenses  availability of export licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse taxes  complex foreign laws and treaties and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collections 
the recent economic and monetary crisis in the pacific rim countries  including korea  malaysia  thailand  philippines  indonesia and other countries in the region  as well as the recent economic and monetary declines in russia  has resulted in a decreased demand in such countries and other foreign regions for capital equipment such as the ground segment systems and networks supplied by the company 
the difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets and the decrease in bookings received by the company from these and other foreign regions have adversely effected the company s results of operations for the fourth quarter of and the company expects that these negative trends will continue to adversely impact it 
in addition  the company is subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa which may place the company at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies  which are not subject to the fcpa 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations the company may continue to experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its results of operations  which may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of the initiation and completion of contracts  delays in the booking of new contracts  the demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of revenues between custom built satellite communications systems and networks designed for its customers and standard installations provided to its customers  the growth of demand for internet infrastructure based products and services in developing countries  the timing of significant marketing programs  the extent and timing of the hiring of additional personnel  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions in the us and abroad  such as the difficult economic conditions and currency devaluations in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets which have adversely impacted  and may continue to  adversely impact the company s quarterly results 
see inherent risk of international operations 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
intense competition  limited barriers to entry the markets for both ground segment systems and networks and satellite delivered data communications services are highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors have greater market presence  engineering and marketing capabilities  and financial  technological and personnel resources than those available to the company 
as a result  such competitors may be able to develop and expand their products and services more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than can the company 
in addition  there are limited barriers to entry in the company s markets and certain of the company s strategic suppliers and customers have technologies and capabilities in the company s product areas and could choose to compete with the company or to replace the company s products or services with their own 
the entry of new competitors  the decision by a strategic ally to compete with the company or the decision by a customer to develop and employ in house capability to satisfy its satellite communications needs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that its competitors may develop or acquire competing products or that provide functionality that is similar to that provided by the company s products and that such products may be offered at significantly lower prices or bundled with other products 
in addition  current and potential competitors in both markets in which the company competes have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address the needs of the company s current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also is dependent on the continued success and development of the satellite communications industry  which itself competes with other technologies such as terrestrial microwave  copper wire and fiber optic communications systems 
any failure of the satellite communications industry to continue to develop  or any technological development which significantly improves the capacity  cost or efficiency of such competing systems relative to satellite systems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see rapid industry change  technological obsolescence 
reliance on strategic relationships the company is dependent on certain customers and suppliers for the development and expansion of its ground segment system and network business 
however  such relationships are not governed by any contract and accordingly neither the company nor such customers or suppliers are obligated to maintain such strategic relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such strategic relationships  that its strategic customers and suppliers will continue to assist the company by developing and expanding its business and by providing research and development expertise  or that such strategic customers and suppliers will not actually compete with the company in the future 
see intense competition  limited barriers to entry 
in addition  the company relies on the personal earth station and direcpc technologies provided by hns  a subsidiary of hughes electronics corp 
in connection with the operation of netsat express s satellite delivered data communications services business 
each project for which netsat express uses hns direcpc technology will require the grant of a license from hns to netsat express 
hns is under no obligation to grant such licenses and there can be no assurance that netsat express will be able to negotiate such licensing arrangements with hns on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  failure to maintain a business relationship with hns would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because the company intends to provide its satellite delivered data communications services almost entirely in developing markets where the company has little or no market experience  the company will also be dependent on local partners in such markets to provide marketing expertise and knowledge of the local regulatory environment in order to facilitate the acquisition of necessary licenses and access to existing customers 
the company has not yet formally established an alliance with a local partner 
the company s failure to form and maintain such alliances with local partners  or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by the actions of the company s competitors or otherwise  would adversely affect the company s ability to penetrate and compete successfully in such emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future in such markets or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of customer concentration the company typically relies upon a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues 
for example  approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were derived from sales to sonangol  uee at june   million  or approximately of the company s backlog  was accounted for by a contract between the company and transworld communications services  inc and million  or approximately of the company s backlog  was accounted for by a contract between the company and sonangol  uee the company expects that in the near term a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from one or a limited number of customers the identity of whom may vary from period to period as the company seeks to expand its business and its customer base 
the reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of such significant customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of management of rapid growth the company has been significantly and rapidly expanding its operations since its inception 
in order to pursue successfully the opportunities presented by the ground segment and emerging satellite delivered communications and internet intranet infrastructure markets  the company will be required to continue to expand its operations 
such expansion has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s personnel  management  financial and other resources 
in order to manage any future growth effectively  the company will  among other things  be required to attract  train  motivate and manage a significantly larger number of employees successfully to conduct product engineering and management  product implementation  sales activity and customer support activities  manage higher working capital requirements  and improve its operating and financial systems 
any failure to manage any future growth in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with the company s business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of fixed price contracts virtually all of the company s contracts for installation of ground segment systems and networks are on a fixed price basis 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering  design and testing 
since the company s business may at certain times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any one contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk of customer concentration 
emphasis on developing markets  uncertain market potential the company believes a substantial portion of the growth in demand for its ground segment systems and networks and its recently launched satellite delivered data communications services will come from customers in developing countries 
there can be no assurance that such increases in demand will occur or that prospective customers will accept such products and services in sufficient quantities or at all 
the degree to which the company is able to penetrate potential markets in developing countries will be affected in major part by the speed with which other competing elements of the communications infrastructure  such as telephone lines  other satellite delivered solutions and fiber optic cable and television cable  are installed in the developing countries and with respect to the company s data communications services  on the effectiveness of the company s local partners in such markets 
the failure to have its products and services accepted in developing countries would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see intense competition  limited barriers to entry and reliance on strategic relationships 
rapid industry change  technological obsolescence the telecommunications industry  including the satellite communications ground segment systems and networks and data communication services businesses  is characterized by rapid and continuous technological change 
future technological advances in the telecommunications industry may result in the availability of new products or services that could compete with the satellite ground segment products and services provided by the company or render the company s products and services obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and introducing new products and services that meet changing customer needs or in responding to technological changes or evolving industry standards in a timely manner  if at all  or that services or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or services noncompetitive 
any failure by the company to respond to changing market conditions  technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements  or the development of competing technology or products that render the company s products and services noncompetitive or obsolete would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the data code field 
these data code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
although the company s internal systems as well as the software it installs in its satellite ground segment systems and networks are designed to be year compliant  there can be no assurance that such systems and software contain all necessary date code changes 
the company and its customers may be affected by year issues 
compliance with year requirements may disrupt the company s ability to continue designing  assembling and installing its satellite ground segment systems and networks 
the company may also incur certain expenditures in connection with year compliance 
additionally  even if the company s internal systems and the software it installs in its ground segment systems and networks are year compliant  there can be no assurance that the equipment the company obtains from third party vendors and incorporates into its ground segment systems and networks is year compliant 
if such equipment is not year compliant  it could disrupt the ability of the company s customers to use the company s ground segment systems and networks 
in addition  there can be no assurance that equipment operated by third parties that interface with or contain the company s products will timely achieve year compliance 
furthermore  if the company s ground segment systems and networks were unable to be used by the company s customers because of year compliance problems  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will not commence litigation against the company for such systems and networks failure 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon suppliers  sole and limited sources of supply the company currently procures most of the critical components and services for its products from single or limited sources in connection with specific contracts and does not otherwise carry significant inventories or have long term or exclusive supply contracts with its source vendors 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in receiving products from certain of its vendors due to quality control or manufacturing problems  shortages of materials or components or product design difficulties 
there can be no assurance that similar problems will not recur or that replacement products will be available when needed at commercially reasonable rates  or at all 
if the company were to change certain of its vendors  the company would be required to perform additional testing procedures upon the components supplied by such new vendors  which could prevent or delay product shipments 
additionally  prices could increase significantly in connection with changes of vendors 
any inability of the company to obtain timely deliveries of materials of acceptable quality or timely services  or any significant increase in the prices of materials or services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk of fixed price contracts and quarterly fluctuations 
risk of failure to comply with government regulations the company is subject to various federal laws and regulations which may have negative effects on the company 
the company operates a teleport in hauppauge  new york  which is subject to fcc rules and regulations 
the company has obtained certain licenses from the fcc for both domestic and international operation of the teleport and must operate it in compliance with fcc rules and regulations for the term of the license 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional licenses that may be required or maintain the necessary licenses 
under the fcc rules and regulations  non us citizens or their representatives  foreign governments  or corporations otherwise subject to control by non us citizens  may not own more than of a licensee directly  or  if the fcc finds it consistent with the public interest  may not own more than of the parent of a licensee 
non us citizens may not serve as officers of a licensee or as members of a licensee s board of directors  although the fcc may waive this requirement in whole or in part 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in the fcc issuing an order to the entity requiring divestiture of alien ownership to bring the entity into compliance with the fcc rules and regulations 
in addition  fines  a denial of renewal or revocation of the license are possible 
the company has no knowledge of any present foreign ownership which would result in a violation of the fcc rules and regulations  but there can be no assurance that foreign holders will not in the future hold more than or of the common stock of the company 
regulatory schemes in countries in which the company may seek to provide its satellite delivered data communications services may impose impediments on the company s operations 
certain countries in which the company intends to operate have telecommunications laws and regulations that do not currently contemplate technical advances in broadcast technology such as internet intranet transmission by satellite 
there can be no assurance that the present regulatory environment in any such country will not be changed in a manner which may have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
the company or its local partners typically must obtain authorization for each country in which the company provides its satellite delivered data communications services 
although the company believes that it or its local partners will be able to obtain the requisite licenses and approvals from the countries in which the company intends to provide service  the regulatory schemes in each country are different and thus there may be instances of noncompliance of which the company is not aware 
although the company believes these regulatory schemes will not prevent the company from pursuing its business plan  there can be no assurance such licenses and approvals are or will remain sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that necessary licenses and approvals will be granted on a timely basis in all jurisdictions in which the company wishes to offer its services or that restrictions applicable thereto will not be unduly burdensome 
the company s internet operations other than the operation of a teleport are not currently subject to direct government regulation in most countries  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted at the local  national or international levels with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy and expression  pricing of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security or the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications 
for example  the telecommunications act of the constitutionality of certain portions of which is currently under challenge was recently enacted in the united states  and imposes criminal penalties via the communications decency act on anyone who distributes obscene  lascivious or indecent communications over the internet 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of the company s internet operations will be carried out in countries which may impose greater regulation of the content of information coming into the country than that which is generally applicable in the united states 
to the extent that the company provides content as a part of its internet services  it will be subject to any such laws regulating content 
moreover  the adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s internet services or increase the company s cost of doing business or in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to such laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for the company s services  could increase the company s cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased product development costs  or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors 
in the normal course of business  the company assesses these risks and has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
the company s objective to managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates for certain purchases from foreign vendors  if applicable 
accordingly  the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
as of june   the company has only one such foreign currency forward contract to hedge its exposure relating to a commitment to purchase approximately us million of equipment from a vendor in swedish krona 
the company s hedge with respect to this transaction reduces  but does not eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if there were an adverse change in the exchange rate of swedish krona of  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial
