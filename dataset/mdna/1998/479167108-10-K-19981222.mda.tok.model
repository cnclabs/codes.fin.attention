vs net sales net sales totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
sales as measured in us dollars were negatively impacted by the effect of weaker foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in comparison to excluding the effects of foreign currency movements and the sale of the plastimo business in january  worldwide sales increased million  or  from the increase was due primarily to sales of products of businesses the company acquired in and and strong growth in sales of watercraft  which more than offset a decline in fishing sales and weaker diving equipment sales in asia 
operating results the company recognized an operating profit of million in compared to an operating profit of million in gross profit margins increased from in to in  primarily as a result of businesses acquired by the company in and the company continues to experience margin pressure in all of its businesses due to competition 
operating expenses  excluding nonrecurring charges  totaled million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in the improvement in the operating expense ratio was attributable to management s efforts to control such expenses and the impact of weaker foreign currencies for much of the year 
these factors were partially offset by operating expenses of businesses acquired in and and unusual legal expenses incurred to successfully defend certain of the company s key outdoor equipment  diving and motors patents and trademarks 
the company recognized nonrecurring charges totaling million in and million in these charges resulted primarily from severance and other costs related to the integration of acquired businesses  primarily in the diving business 
the company anticipates additional nonrecurring charges of approximately million will be incurred in to further integrate recent acquisitions into its business 
other income and expenses interest expense increased million in  reflecting higher debt levels resulting from the acquisition of five businesses since july  which was partially offset by lower levels of working capital  primarily inventory  and a favorable interest rate environment 
overall results the company recognized net income of million in  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the company recorded income tax expense of million in  an effective rate of  due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at higher rates than in the united states 
the tax benefit of operating losses generated in the united states did not fully offset the taxes in these foreign jurisdictions 
the company s effective tax rate improved from in the prior year due to a rate reduction in italy and an increase in profits in switzerland  which has lower overall tax rates 
vs net sales net sales were million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
the sale of the company s plastimo business in january accounted for million of the shortfall in sales 
sales as measured in us dollars were also negatively impacted by the effect of weaker foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in comparison to excluding the effects of foreign currency movements and the sale of the plastimo business  worldwide sales decreased million from the remainder of the shortfall was due primarily to decreases in sales of motors and fishing products  as the overall market for such products declined  offset by sales of businesses acquired in operating results the company recognized an operating profit of million in compared to an operating loss of million in several factors accounted for the turnaround 
gross profit margins increased from in to in unusual charges related to reduction of inventories to their net realizable value reduced the gross profit by million and the related margin by 
underabsorption of overhead expenses due to lower sales volume and sales of excess inventory at lower than normal margins mitigated the increase in gross profit margins in operating expenses  excluding nonrecurring charges  totaled million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in the sale of the company s plastimo marine business accounted for million of the reduction in operating expenses

the company s profitability in and also contributed to the positive cash flow 
growth in inventories and net losses were primarily responsible for the million of cash used for operations in depreciation and amortization charges were million in  million in and million in amortization of intangible assets arising from the company s and acquisitions and increased depreciation from capital spending in all years accounted for the increases in these charges 
investing activities expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in  and million in the company s recurring investments are primarily related to tooling for new products  facilities and information systems improvements 
in  capital expenditures are anticipated to total approximately million 
these expenditures are expected to be funded by working capital or existing credit facilities 
the company completed the acquisitions of three businesses in and two businesses in  which increased tangible and intangible assets and debt by million and million  respectively 
the sale of the company s plastimo business in january provided million of cash  which was used to reduce short term debt 
financing activities the following table sets forth the company s debt and capital structure at the end of the past three years millions current debt long term debt total debt shareholders equity total capitalization total debt to total capital ratio cash flows from financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in in  the company consummated a private placement of long term debt totaling million 
in anticipation of this financing  short term debt to be repaid totaling million at october  was classified as long term 
payments on long term debt required to be made in total million 
at october   the company had available unused credit facilities in excess of million  which is believed to be adequate for its needs 
market risk management the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to these market risks is managed by entering into hedging transactions authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities 
hedging transactions involve the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are used only where there is an underlying exposure not for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign operations the company has significant foreign operations  for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in swiss and french francs  german marks  italian lire  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
as the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company has operations increase or decrease relative to the us dollar  the sales  expenses  profits  assets and liabilities of the company s foreign operations  as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements  increase or decrease  accordingly 
the company mitigates a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the purchase of foreign currency swaps  forward contracts and options to hedge known commitments  primarily for purchases of inventory and other assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the significant appreciation of the us dollar and the sale of the plastimo business reduced the cumulative translation component of shareholders equity by million in the impact of foreign currency movements were less significant in and interest rates the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to united states interest rates 
the company also periodically enters into interest rate swaps  caps or collars to hedge its exposure and lower financing costs 
commodities certain components used in the company s products are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
primary commodity price exposures are metals and packaging materials 
sensitivity to changes in value the estimates that follow are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value or earnings the company could lose in one year from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings that the company expects to incur 
the estimates do not consider favorable changes in market rates 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  any loss or gain in the fair value of derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations are foreign exchange forwards  currency swaps and fixed rate debt 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential one year loss in fair value and earnings before income taxes from a movement in foreign currencies and a basis point movement in interest rate market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at october  estimated impact on earnings before millions fair value income taxes foreign exchange rate instruments interest rate instruments other factors the company has not been significantly impacted by inflationary pressures over the last several years 
the company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and  accordingly  the prices of its products 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact the cost of the company s products 
the company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design  identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and foreign currency hedges 
price increases and  in certain situations  price decreases are implemented for individual products  when appropriate 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define years 
computers or other equipment with date sensitive software may recognize as the year rather than this could result in system failures or miscalculations 
if the company or its significant customers or suppliers fail to correct year issues  the company s ability to operate could be materially affected 
the company has assessed the impact of year issues on the processing of date related information for all of its information systems infrastructure and non technical assets  such as production equipment 
all systems and non technical assets are in the process of being inventoried and classified as to their compliance with year data processing 
any systems found year deficient will be modified  upgraded or replaced 
project plans anticipate all existing  critical information systems infrastructure and non technical assets to be year compliant before failure to comply would significantly disrupt the company s operations 
contingency plans will be developed to address any failures resulting from relationships with customers  suppliers or other third parties 
the company has made inquiries of its suppliers  customers and other organizations which impact the company s business  but cannot guarantee that circumstances beyond its control will not have an adverse impact on its operations 
since  the company has invested approximately million in information systems improvements and has been migrating its businesses to systems that are year compliant 
based on assessments and testing to date  the financial impact of addressing any potential remaining internal system issues should not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
pending accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company has not yet determined the impact of statement on the consolidated financial statements 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt this accounting standard for the year beginning october the fasb has issued a number of other pronouncements related to financial statement disclosure 
these pronouncements will not impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company  when adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information with respect to this item is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading market risk management
