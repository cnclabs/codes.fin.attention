item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unaudited  continued year the year issue pertains to computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
many of the corporation s computer programs were written using the common practice of defining a year with two digits 
as the year approaches  programs with date related logic will be unable to distinguish between the years and potential problems arising include software and hardware failing  errors occurring in calculations  or information being presented in an unusable format 
in february the corporation responded to the year issue by starting a project designed to update its computer systems 
this project entails changing computer code of programs developed internally and upgrading software originally purchased from third party vendors 
the project is progressing as scheduled and is expected to be completed by december  management does not anticipate any significant impact on the corporation s operations resulting from the use of its computer systems beyond the corporation is also communicating with large customers and significant suppliers of goods and services to determine these entities readiness to resolve their own year issues 
there is no assurance that any customer or supplier will be year compliant  however any potential lack of compliance is not expected to have an adverse impact to the corporation 
the estimated cost of this project  which is being expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the above information is based on management s best estimates  and no guarantee can be made that these estimates will be achieved

on a long term basis the corporation has demonstrated an ability to adjust the selling prices of its products in reaction to changing costs due to inflation
