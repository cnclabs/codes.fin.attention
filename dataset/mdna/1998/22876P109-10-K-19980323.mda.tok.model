management periodically reviews its investment in properties for evidence of other than temporary impairments in value 
factors considered consist of  but are not limited to  the following current and projected occupancy rates  market conditions in different geographic regions  and management s plans with respect to its properties 
where management concludes that expected cash flows will not enable the company to recover the carrying amount of its investments  losses are recorded and asset values are reduced 
no such impairments in value existed during  or operating results 
net income totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
for  net income increased  over the prior year due primarily to i the increase in rental revenues  which was partially offset by the increases in property operations expense and depreciation expense  ii the decrease in mortgage and loan interest expense and iii the gain on sale or disposition of assets 
for  net income decreased  over the prior year due primarily to i the interest revenue earned during on the tkpl mortgage notes which were retired by tkpl during and ii the gain associated with the partial repayment of a tkpl note to southeast during liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   the company generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities 
the company s primary internal sources of cash are i the collection of rents from buildings owned by the company and ii the receipt of management fees paid to the company in respect of properties managed on behalf of others 
as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to pay out annually  as dividends  percent of its reit taxable income which  due to non cash charges  including depreciation and net operating loss carryforwards  may be substantially less than cash flow 
in the past  the company has paid out dividends in amounts at least equal to its reit taxable income 
the company believes that its cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to cover debt service payments and to pay the dividends required to maintain reit status through the level of cash flow generated by rents depends primarily on the occupancy rates of the company s buildings and changes in rental rates on new and renewed leases and under escalation provisions 
as of december   approximately percent of the company s annualized gross rental revenues were derived from existing leases containing provisions for rent escalations 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents under such provisions 
as of december   leases representing approximately percent of the gross annualized rent from the company s properties  without regard to the exercise of options to renew  were due to expire during this represents  leases for space in buildings located in of the koger centers or locations in which the company owns buildings 
certain of these tenants may not renew their leases or may reduce their demand for space 
leases were renewed on approximately percent  percent and percent of the company s net rentable square feet which were scheduled to expire during  and  respectively 
for those leases which renewed during  the average rental rate increased from to 
however  current market conditions in certain markets may require that rental rates at which leases are renewed or at which vacated space is leased be lower than rental rates under existing leases 
based upon the significant amount of leases which will expire during and the competition for tenants in the markets in which the company operates  the company has offered  and expects to continue to offer  incentives to certain new and renewal tenants 
these incentives may include the payment of tenant improvement costs and  in certain markets  reduced rents during initial lease periods 
the company continues to benefit from improving economic conditions and reduced vacancy levels for office buildings in many of the metropolitan areas in which the company owns buildings 
the company believes that the southeastern and southwestern regions of the united states provide significant economic growth potential due to their diverse regional economies  expanding metropolitan areas  skilled work force and moderate labor costs 
however  the company cannot predict whether such economic growth will continue 
cash flow from operations could be reduced if economic growth were not to continue in the company s markets and if this resulted in lower occupancy rates for the company s buildings 
governmental tenants including the state of florida and the united states of america which accounted for percent of the company s leased space as of december   may be subject to budget reductions in times of recession and governmental austerity measures 
consequently  there can be no assurance that governmental appropriations for rents may not be reduced 
additionally  certain of the private sector tenants which have contributed to the company s rent stream may reduce their current demands  or curtail their future need  for additional office space 
at the end of  the company had management contracts for the management of commercial office properties 
on march   a management agreement to manage commercial office buildings owned by centoff was automatically extended to march  this management agreement provides that  so long as no default has occurred  the management agreement will be automatically extended from year to year until such time as the management agreement is terminated

during  the company earned management fees of  for the management of this building 
with the sale of tkpl s buildings to koala during  southeast s management agreement with tkpl ended 
investing activities 
at december   substantially all of the company s invested assets were in real properties

financing activities 
historically  the company s primary external sources of cash have been in the form of bank borrowings  mortgage financings  and public and private offerings of equity securities 
the proceeds of these financings were used by the company to acquire buildings or to refinance debt 
the company has a million secured revolving credit facility provided by first union national bank of florida  morgan guaranty trust company of new york  amsouth bank  na and guaranty federal bank 
during  the company s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of the company s common stock the shares and the company repurchased  shares for approximately million 
during july  the company s board of directors approved the redemption of warrants outstanding on august  the redemption date for per warrant 
each warrant gave the holder the right to purchase one share at a price of per share  until the redemption date 
the company redeemed  warrants following the redemption date 
the remaining warrants were exercised by the holders either on or prior to the redemption date 
on december   the company completed a public offering of million shares of its common stock  three million shares of which were sold in an underwritten offering for an aggregate sales price of million per share less an underwriting discount of per share  and  of such shares were sold to apollo for an aggregate sales price of million per share 
the company applied approximately million of the proceeds from this sale to the repayment of indebtedness with an average interest rate of approximately percent 
during october  the company completed a private placement of three million shares of its common stock to an affiliate of apollo for an aggregate sales price of million 
the company applied the proceeds from this sale to the repayment of indebtedness with an average interest rate of approximately percent 
during december  the company closed on million of a million non recourse loan with northwestern which is secured by office parks 
this loan is divided into i a tranche in the amount of million million which has been drawn with a year maturity and an interest rate of percent and ii a tranche in the amount of million with a maturity of years and an interest rate of percent 
amortization with respect to this indebtedness is based on equal monthly installments over a year amortization period 
this indebtedness requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
during april  the company closed on a million secured revolving credit facility 
this secured revolving credit facility was increased to million during december this facility provides for monthly interest payments and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
loan maturities and normal amortization of mortgages and loans payable are expected to total approximately million over the next twelve months 
the company believes that these obligations will be paid from cash provided by operations or from current cash balances 
significant maturities of the company s mortgages and loans payable do not begin to occur until at december   the company had buildings containing approximately million net rentable square feet which were unencumbered 
in order to generate funds sufficient to make principal payments in respect of indebtedness of the company over the long term  as well as necessary capital and tenant acquisition expenditures  the company will be required to successfully refinance its indebtedness or procure additional equity capital 
however  there can be no assurance that any such refinancing or equity financing will be achieved or will generate adequate funds on a timely basis for these purposes 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to existing shareholders may result 
unfavorable conditions in the financial markets  the degree of leverage of the company and various other factors may limit the ability of the company to successfully undertake any such financings  and no assurance can be given as to the availability of alternative sources of funds 
the company has filed shelf registration statements with respect to the issuance of up to million of its common and or preferred stock 
the company has issued million of its common stock under such registration statements 
during  the company wrote off  of certain costs incurred for potential public and private offerings of equity securities which management determined had no future value 
in addition  in the event the company is unable to generate sufficient funds both to meet principal payments in respect of its indebtedness and to satisfy distribution requirements of percent of annual reit taxable income to its shareholders  the company may be unable to qualify as a reit 
in such an event  the company i will incur federal income taxes and perhaps penalties  ii if the company is then paying dividends  may be required to decrease any dividend payments to its shareholders  and iii the market price of the company s common stock may decrease 
the company would also be prohibited from requalifying as a reit for five years 
impact of inflation the company may experience increases in its expenses as a result of inflation  however  the amount of such increases cannot be accurately determined 
the company s exposure to inflationary cost increases in property level expenses is reduced by escalation clauses which are included in most leases 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents 
inflationary pressure may increase operating expenses  including labor and energy costs and  indirectly  real estate taxes above expected levels  at a time when it may not be possible to increase lease rates to offset such higher operating expenses 
in addition  inflation can have secondary effects upon occupancy rates by decreasing the demand for office space in many of the markets in which the company operates 
as of december   percent of the company s annualized rentals were subject to leases having annual escalation clauses as described under properties above 
as of december  and  percent and percent  respectively  of the company s annualized rentals were subject to leases having annual escalation clauses 
historically  inflation has often caused increases in the value of income producing real estate through higher rentals 
the company  however  can provide no assurance that inflation will increase the value of its properties in the future  and  in fact  the rate of inflation over recent years has been considerably below that which has been experienced previously 
cautionary statement relevant to forward looking information for purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their businesses without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  together with related data and projections  about the company s projected financial results and its future plans and strategies 
however  actual results and needs of the company may vary materially from forward looking statements and projections made from time to time by the company on the basis of management s then current expectations 
the business in which the company is engaged involves changing and competitive markets and a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that forward looking statements and projections will prove accurate 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors which could cause the company s actual performance and financial results to differ materially from any results which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company 
real estate financing risks existing debt 
the company is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including a the risk that the company s cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  b the risk that the existing debt in respect of the company s properties which in substantially all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity will not be able to be refinanced and c the risk that the terms of any refinancing of any existing debt will not be as favorable as the terms of such existing debt 
the company currently has outstanding debt of approximately million  all of which is secured by certain of the company s properties 
approximately million of such debt will mature before  with the remaining balance maturing in if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  the company expects that its cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all such maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing than the interest rates on the existing debt  the interest expense relating to such refinanced debt would increase  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow and the amount of distributions the company would be able to make to its shareholders 
if the company has mortgaged a property to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to meet the mortgage payments  then the mortgagee may foreclose upon  or otherwise take control of  such property  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
risk of rising interest rates and variable rate debt 
the company currently has a million secured revolving credit facility with variable interest rates 
the company may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
increases in interest rates on such debt could increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay distributions to its shareholders 
existing leverage  no limitation on debt as of december   the debt to total market capitalization ratio of the company was approximately percent 
the company s policy regarding this ratio ie  total consolidated debt as a percentage of the sum of the market value of issued and outstanding capital stock plus total consolidated debt is not subject to any limitation in the organizational documents of the company 
accordingly  the board of directors could establish a policy and decide to borrow on a case by case or other basis  which would increase the company s debt to total market capitalization ratio 
if this action were taken  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that a could adversely affect the company s cash flow and  consequently  the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders and b could increase the risk of default on the company s debt 
for purposes of establishing and evaluating its debt policy  the company measures its leverage by reference to the total market capitalization of the company rather than by reference to the book value of its assets 
the company has used total market capitalization because it believes that the book value of its assets which to a large extent is comprised of the depreciated value of real property  the company s primary tangible asset does not accurately reflect its ability to borrow and to meet debt service requirements 
the market capitalization of the company  however  is more variable than book value  and does not necessarily reflect the fair market value of the underlying assets of the company at all times 
the company also considers factors other than its market capitalization in making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness  such as the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of its properties upon refinancing and the ability of particular properties  and the company as a whole  to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
geographic concentration the company s revenues and the value of its properties may be affected by a number of factors  including the regional and local economic climates of the metropolitan areas in which the company s buildings are located which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors and regional and local real estate conditions in such areas such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  office and other competing commercial properties 
all of the company s properties are located in the southeastern and southwestern united states 
the company s performance and its ability to make distributions to its shareholders are  therefore  dependent on economic conditions in these market areas 
the company s historical growth has occurred during periods when the economy in the southeastern and southwestern united states has out performed the national economy 
there can be no assurance as to the continued growth of the economy in the southeastern and southwestern united states or the future growth rate of the company 
renewal of leases and reletting of space the company is subject to the risks that upon expiration of leases for space located in its buildings a such leases may not be renewed  b such space may not be relet or c the terms of renewal or reletting taking into account the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
leases on a total of percent and percent of the total net rentable square feet leased in the company s buildings will expire in and  respectively 
if the company is unable to promptly relet  or renew the leases for  all or a substantial portion of the space located in its buildings  or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rental rates  or if the company s reserves for these purposes prove inadequate  then the company s cash flow and its ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders may be adversely affected 
real estate investment risks general risks 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if the company s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including current levels of debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other capital expenditures  the company may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and the company s cash flow and its ability to make distributions to its shareholders will be adversely affected 
the company must obtain external financing to meet future debt maturities 
the company s net revenues and the value of its properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national  regional and local economic climates  regional and local real estate conditions  the perceptions of prospective tenants as to the attractiveness of the property  the ability of the company to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and increased operating costs including real estate taxes and utilities 
in addition  real estate values and income from properties are also affected by such factors as applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
illiquidity of real estate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
such illiquidity will tend to limit the ability of the company to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code limits the company s ability to sell certain properties held for fewer than four years  which may affect the company s ability to sell its properties 
competition 
numerous office buildings compete with the company s buildings in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of these competing buildings are newer  better located or better capitalized than some of the company s buildings 
moreover  the company believes that major national or regional commercial property developers will continue to seek development opportunities in the southeastern and southwestern united states 
these developers may have greater financial resources than the company 
the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to lease space in its buildings or at newly developed or acquired properties and the rents charged 
changes in laws 
because increases in income  service or transfer taxes are generally not passed through to tenants under leases  such increases may adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to make distributions to its shareholders 
the company s properties are also subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act the ada and state and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
the company believes that its properties are currently in compliance with all such regulatory requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures by the company and could have an adverse effect on the company s cash flow and expected distributions 
uninsured loss 
the company presently carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood where appropriate  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to its properties  with policy specifications and insured limits customary for similar properties 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as from wars that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss exceeding policy limits occur  the company could lose both its capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of its properties 
bankruptcy and financial condition of tenants 
at any time  a tenant of the company s buildings may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the cash flow available for distribution by the company 
no assurance can be given that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
in addition  a tenant from time to time may experience a downturn in its business which may weaken its financial condition and result in its failure to make rental payments when due 
if a tenant s lease is not affirmed following bankruptcy or if a tenant s financial condition weakens  the company s income may be adversely affected 
americans with disabilities act compliance 
under the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements relating to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in compliance with the requirements of the ada could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although the company believes that its properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  the company may incur additional costs to comply with the ada 
although the company believes that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company  if required changes involve a greater expenditure than the company currently anticipates  the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders could be adversely affected 
risks involved in property ownership through partnership and joint ventures 
although the company owns fee simple interests in its properties  in the future the company could  if then permitted by the covenants in its loan agreements and its financial position  participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships or joint ventures 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present in property ownership  including the possibility that a the company s partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  b such partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with the business interests or goals of the company  and c such partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to the instructions or the requests of the company or contrary to the company s policies or objectives  including the company s policy to maintain its qualification as a reit 
the company will  however  seek to maintain sufficient control of such participants or joint ventures to permit the company s business objectives to be achieved 
there is no limitation under the company s organizational documents as to the amount of available funds that may be invested in partnerships or joint ventures 
impact of inflation 
the company may experience increases in its expenses  including debt service  as a result of inflation 
the company s exposure to inflationary cost increases in property level expenses is reduced by escalation clauses which are included in most of its leases 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents 
inflationary pressure may increase operating expenses  including labor and energy costs and  indirectly  real estate taxes above expected levels at a time when it may not be possible for the company to increase lease rates to offset such higher operating expenses 
in addition  inflation can have secondary effects upon occupancy rates by decreasing the demand for office space in many of the markets in which the company operates 
although  inflation has historically often caused increases in the value of income producing real estate through higher rentals  the company can provide no assurance that inflation will increase the value of its properties in the future and  in fact  the rate of inflation over recent years has been considerably below that which has been experienced previously 
risk of development  construction and acquisition activities within the constraints of its policy concerning leverage  the company has and will continue to develop and construct office buildings  particularly on its undeveloped land 
risks associated with the company s development and construction activities  including activities relating to its undeveloped land  may include abandonment of development opportunities  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates and possibly making the property uneconomical  insufficient occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property to make the property profitable  unavailability of financing on favorable terms for development of a property  and the failure to complete construction and lease up on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
development activities are subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
the company will continue to acquire office buildings 
acquisitions of office buildings entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the cost of improvements to bring an acquired building up to standards established for the market position intended for such building may prove inaccurate 
in addition  there are general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
the company anticipates that any future developments and acquisitions would be financed through a combination of internally generated cash  equity investments and secured or unsecured financing
