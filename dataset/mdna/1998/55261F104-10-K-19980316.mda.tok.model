resulting largely from growth in average loans outstanding  taxable equivalent net interest income increased in to million from million in average loans totaled billion in  up from billion in similarly  average earning assets increased  to billion in from billion in a increase in average earning assets  primarily loans  in was also the most significant factor for the rise in that year s net interest income from million in average loans and average earning assets in were billion and billion  respectively 
improvement in s net interest income resulting from asset growth was partially offset by a reduction of the company s net interest margin  or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest margin in was  compared with in and in the provision for possible credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs in were million  compared with million in and million in the increase in net charge offs from prior years reflects higher levels of net consumer loan charge offs which totaled million in  million in and million in noninterest income for totaled million  above the million in and above the million in excluding gains from sales of bank investment securities 
higher revenues associated with mortgage banking  trust activities  sales of mutual funds and annuities  and prior expansion of the company s credit card business contributed to the growth of noninterest income 
noninterest expense was million in  up from million in and from million in expenses associated with expansion of businesses providing mortgage banking services  indirect automobile loans  credit cards and the sale of mutual funds and annuities contributed to the rise in noninterest expense since net interest income lending and funding activities taxable equivalent net interest income rose to million in from million in  largely the result of growth in average earning assets  which increased million or to billion in from billion in taxable equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in were million and billion  respectively 
the growth in average earning assets in and was attributable to increases in average loans outstanding 
average loans totaled billion in  up from billion in average loans in were increased from billion in the accompanying table summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in and percentage changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio over the past two years 
loans secured by real estate  excluding million of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit which are classified as consumer loans  represented approximately of the loan and lease portfolio during  unchanged from  but down from in at december   the company held approximately billion of commercial real estate loans and billion of consumer real estate loans  compared with billion and billion  respectively  at december  commercial real estate loans originated by the company are predominately secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area  including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of new york city  and western new york  which includes buffalo  niagara falls  rochester and surrounding areas 
commercial real estate loans are also originated in the hudson valley and southern tier regions of new york state 
most commercial real estate loans originated by the company are fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining principal at maturity  usually five years after loan origination 
for borrowers in good standing  the customer may extend the terms of the loan agreement for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest 
the accompanying table presents commercial real estate loans at december  by geographic area  type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding 
of the billion of commercial real estate loans in the new york city metropolitan area  approximately were secured by multi family residential properties  by retail space and by office space 
the company s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi family residential properties 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of new york city area loans were for million or less  while loans of more than million were approximately of the total 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in new york state  mostly in western new york  tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of loans in this segment of the portfolio were for million or less 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of new york state and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the new york city metropolitan area comprised less than of total commercial real estate loans 
the company normally refrains from commercial construction lending  except when the borrower has obtained a commitment for permanent financing upon project completion 
as a result  the portfolio of commercial construction loans for which the company has not committed to provide permanent financing totaled only million  or of total loans and leases at december  real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled billion at december   approximately of which were secured by properties located in new york state 
at december   million of residential real estate loans were held for sale by the company s mortgage banking subsidiary  m t mortgage corporation 
consumer loans and leases represented approximately of the loan portfolio during  compared with in and in automobile loans and home equity loans and lines of credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio 
at december   of the automobile loan portfolio was to borrowers in new york state  while the remainder was primarily to borrowers in pennsylvania 
automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers  however  all applications submitted by dealers are subject to the company s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures 
during  automobile loans and leases represented approximately of the company s average loan portfolio  while no other consumer loan product represented more than 
during  the company securitized and sold million of automobile loans  resulting in a nominal gain 
growth in average credit card balances in recent years was the result of direct mail marketing campaigns and co branding initiatives 
such initiatives involved developing relationships with retailers and other enterprises and issuing co branded credit cards that provide cardholders the ability to earn rebates on purchases made with the cards 
the company bears the cost of these rebates 
as discussed later  during the company either terminated or agreed to terminate several co branded credit card programs that had been initiated in or late average outstanding balances related to these programs were million in  million in and million in at december   of outstanding credit card balances were with customers in new york state 
the company s portfolio of investment securities averaged billion in  billion in and billion in the size of the investment securities portfolio is influenced by such factors as demand for loans  which generally yield more than investment securities  ongoing repayments  the level of deposits  and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios 
the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  and shorter term us treasury notes 
when purchasing investment securities  the company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other risks assumed 
the company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates  actual or anticipated prepayments  or credit risk associated with a particular security 
the average balance of money market assets  which are comprised of interest bearing deposits at banks  trading account assets  federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities  was million in  compared with million in and million in core deposits  consisting of noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts  savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under  represent the most significant source of funding to the company 
core deposits generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities 
the company s new york state branch network is its principal source of core deposits 
certificates of deposit under  generated on a nationwide basis by m t bank  na are also included in core deposits 
in  average core deposits totaled billion  up from billion in and billion in average core deposits of m t bank  na  which began operations in the fourth quarter of  were million in  million in and million in funding provided by core deposits totaled of average earning assets in  compared with in and in an analysis of changes in the components of core deposits is presented in the accompanying table the company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of  or more  deposits originated through the company s offshore branch office  and brokered certificates of deposit 
domestic time deposits over  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  averaged billion in  compared with million in and million in offshore deposits  comprised primarily of accounts with balances of  or more  averaged million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
brokered deposits averaged billion in  billion in and million in  and totaled billion at december  brokered deposits are used as an alternative to short term borrowings to lengthen the average maturity of interest bearing liabilities 
the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at december  was years 
however  certain of the deposits have provisions that allow early redemption 
additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time 
in addition to deposits  the company uses short term borrowings from banks  securities dealers  the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and others as sources of funding 
short term borrowings averaged million in  billion in and billion in in general  short term borrowings have been used to fund the company s discretionary investments in money market assets and investment securities  and  if necessary  to replace deposit outflows 
also providing funding in were two separate issuances of trust preferred securities totaling million 
in january  first empire completed an offering of trust preferred securities that raised million of capital 
the year offering of fixed rate cumulative trust preferred securities was sold through first empire capital trust i 
first empire completed another offering of trust preferred securities in june raising million of capital 
this year offering of fixed rate cumulative trust preferred securities was sold through first empire capital trust ii 
the preferred securities provide investors with call protection for ten years 
the trusts were formed solely to issue the trust preferred securities and advance proceeds to first empire by purchasing first empire s junior subordinated debt 
the proceeds of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier or core capital for first empire under the federal reserve board s risk based capital guidelines 
payments on the junior subordinated debt of first empire  which are in turn passed through the trusts to the holders of the preferred securities  will be serviced through existing liquidity and cash flow sources of first empire 
under current tax law  first empire will be permitted to deduct interest payments on the junior subordinated debt in computing taxable income 
further information regarding the trust preferred securities is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
these securities  along with million of subordinated capital notes issued in prior years by m t bank  of which million mature in and million mature in  are included in long term borrowings 
long term borrowings averaged million in  million in and million in net interest income is impacted by changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  as well as changes in interest rates and spreads 
net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in  compared with in a greater proportion of loans  which typically yield more than money market assets and investment securities  in the composition of the earning asset portfolio resulted in the yield on earning assets increasing slightly  to in from in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points hundredths of one percent to in from in due to generally higher prevailing interest rates and the effect of the previously discussed issuances of million of trust preferred securities 
in  the net interest spread was  the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 
a greater proportion of loans in the composition of earning assets somewhat mitigated a general decrease in market interest rates in compared with largely due to the changes in the net interest spread described herein  the company s net interest margin was in  compared with in and in interest free funds  consisting largely of noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity  contributed 
to net interest margin in  compared with 
in and 
in average interest free funds were billion in  billion in and billion in future changes in market interest rates or spreads  as well as changes in the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios 
as part of the management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the loan and deposit portfolios 
revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on loans or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
the notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was approximately billion 
in general  under the terms of these swaps  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates 
however  under terms of a million swap  the company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
the average notional amounts of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes and the related effect on net interest income and margin are presented in the accompanying table the company estimates that as of december  it would have received approximately million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes had been terminated 
this estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates and should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet and the company s overall interest rate risk profile 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued a proposed statement of financial accounting standards proposed statement that would significantly change generally accepted accounting for interest rate swaps  other derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
the proposed statement would require that an entity recognize all derivatives including interest rate swaps as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
provision for possible credit losses the purpose of the provision is to replenish or build the company s allowance for possible credit losses to a level necessary to maintain an adequate reserve position 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which the borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
significant loans are individually analyzed  while other smaller balance loans are evaluated by loan category 
based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for possible credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses from existing loans and leases 
the provision for possible credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs for were million  compared with million in and million in as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs were 
in  
in and 
in nonperforming loans totaled million or 
of loans outstanding at december   compared with million or 
of loans a year earlier and million or 
at december  the allowance for possible credit losses was million or of net loans and leases at the end of  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was  and at year end  and  respectively 
the accompanying table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management s classification of loans under the company s internal loan grading system and assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by the company s internal loan review department and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i generally poor economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in market regions served by the company  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  iii the effect of expansion into new markets and or loan product types and  iv the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance 
nevertheless  the allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan category 
accordingly  the amounts presented in the table do not necessarily indicate future losses within the individual loan categories 
several factors influence the company s credit loss experience  including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december   million of nonperforming commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in the new york city metropolitan area  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
net charge offs of commercial real estate loans were 
million in  million in and million in included in these totals are net charge offs of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area of million  
million and million in  and  respectively 
net charge offs of consumer loans totaled million in  or of average consumer loans outstanding during the year  compared with million or in and million or 
in higher charge offs of credit card balances and indirect automobile loans were the most significant factors contributing to the increased level of consumer loan charge offs in and compared with net credit card and indirect automobile loan charge offs in were million and million  respectively  compared with million and million  respectively  in and million and million  respectively  in the increased levels of charge offs of credit card and indirect automobile loans in and as compared to prior years can  in part  be attributed to higher levels of consumer bankruptcies and  in general  is consistent with trends reported by other financial institutions 
nonperforming consumer loans totaled million or 
of outstanding consumer loans at december   compared with million or 
at december  and million or 
at december  commercial real estate loans secured by multi family properties in the new york city metropolitan area were of loans outstanding at december  however  the company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded of total loans at december  furthermore  the company had no exposure to less developed countries  and only million of foreign loans in total 
assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans totaled million at december   compared with million and million at the end of and  respectively 
other income excluding the effect from sales of bank investment securities  other income increased to million in from million in and was higher than the million earned in mortgage banking revenues  which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing fee income  gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights  and other residential mortgage loan related fees  increased to million in from million in and million in revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were million in  million in and million in gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights increased to million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the company originates residential mortgage loans in new york state  as well as in arizona  colorado  massachusetts  ohio  oregon  utah and washington 
originations of residential mortgage loans were billion in  billion in and billion in residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
capitalized servicing assets were million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in from million in  and from million in trust income of million increased from million in  and from million in merchant discount and other credit card fees in totaled million  compared with million in and million in expansion of the company s credit card business was the primary factor in the improvement in s fees from due to poorer than expected results  during the company either terminated or agreed to terminate during the first quarter of several of its co branded credit card programs 
these programs were initiated during and merchant discount and other credit card fees earned in connection with the programs were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
credit card balances related to these programs that remained outstanding at december  were million  compared with million a year earlier 
trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of million in  million in and million in other revenues from operations totaled million in  compared with million in and million in such amounts include revenues from sales of mutual funds and annuities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income earned from venture capital and other investments also contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations in other expense other expense totaled million in  up from million in when a million charge was recognized for a special assessment to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
other expense totaled million in salaries and employee benefits expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the increase was due largely to higher incentive based compensation arrangements  including stock appreciation rights  and merit salary increases 
personnel costs in increased million or from million in factors contributing to such increase were merit salary increases  costs associated with the opening of supermarket banking locations in and the second half of  and the expansion of subsidiaries providing residential mortgage banking services  indirect automobile loans and sales of mutual funds and annuities 
the number of full time equivalent employees was  at december   down from  at december   but up from  at december  nonpersonnel expenses for totaled million  little changed from million in  but up from million in excluding the million charge in for the special assessment by the fdic  nonpersonnel expense increased in from higher costs associated with the company s mortgage banking business  including amortization of capitalized servicing rights  contributed to the increase 
the increase in nonpersonnel expenses in from was largely caused by higher expenses associated with the expansion of businesses providing mortgage banking services  indirect automobile loans  credit cards and the sale of mutual funds and annuities  partially offset by lower deposit insurance expense 
customer rebates and other expenses based on card usage directly attributable to the terminated co branded credit card programs previously noted were approximately million in  million in and million in income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million  up from million in and million in the effective tax rates were in  in and in a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
international activities the company s net investment in international assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
total offshore deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
liquidity  market risk  and interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary  the company is exposed to various risks  including liquidity and market risk 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
accordingly  a critical element in managing a financial institution is ensuring that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating expenses  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
the company s core deposits have historically provided a significant source of funds 
such deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
as a result  and consistent with banking industry experience in general  the company has experienced a reduction in the percentage of earning assets funded by core deposits 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
the company supplements funding from core deposits with various wholesale borrowings  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and brokered certificates of deposit 
additionally  m t bank has a credit facility with the fhlb aggregating million  with any borrowings secured by loans and investment securities 
borrowings outstanding under such credit facility totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
although informal and sometimes reciprocal  sources of funding are available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
first empire s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
as previously discussed  during first empire issued junior subordinated debt to two special purpose subsidiaries  which provided funding 
additional information regarding the junior subordinated debt is included in note of notes to financial statements 
first empire also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  all of which was available for borrowing at december  the company expects to have access to sufficient liquid assets to fund the cash portion of the previously discussed onbancorp acquisition and  accordingly  management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either first empire or its subsidiary banks 
furthermore  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk 
as a result of interest rate risk  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
management s philosophy toward positioning the company for interest rate movements is to attempt to limit such variability 
the balances of both on and off balance sheet financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the company s financial instruments 
as part of managing interest rate risk  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of approximately billion at december  information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
the asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors the company s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model which considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken action  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and entering into or modifying existing interest rate swap agreements 
the accompanying table displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year 
the calculation of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income is based upon many assumptions  including prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumes gradual changes in rates of and basis points up and down during a twelve month period 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter these changes 
in accordance with industry practice  the accompanying table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities 
trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward and futures contracts related to foreign currency exchange and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  and interest rate contracts such as swaps 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risk resulting from its trading activities 
however  the company generally mitigates exposure arising from trading activities by entering into offsetting positions 
accordingly  the company s exposure to interest rate  foreign exchange or other price risk related to trading activities as of december  was not considered material 
capital total stockholders equity at december  was billion or of total assets  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  on a per share basis  common stockholders equity was at december   an increase of from at december  and from at december  the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was  and in  and  respectively 
stockholders equity at december  was increased by million  or per common share  for the net after tax impact of unrealized gains on investment securities classified as available for sale  compared with a reduction for unrealized losses of million  or 
per common share  at december  and million  or 
per common share  at december  the unrealized gains at december  represent the amount by which the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale exceeded amortized cost  net of applicable income taxes 
the market valuation of investment securities should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet of the company 
with the exception of investment securities classified as available for sale  trading account assets and liabilities  and residential mortgage loans held for sale  the carrying values of financial instruments in the balance sheet are generally not adjusted for appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from changes in interest rates 
cash dividends on common stock of million were paid in  compared with million in and million in the quarterly common stock dividend rate remained at 
per share throughout in total  dividends per common share increased to in from in and in on march   all shares of first empire s convertible preferred stock were converted by the holder of such stock into  shares of first empire common stock at a contractual conversion price of per share 
dividends of 
million were paid to the preferred stockholder in  compared with million in in february  first empire announced a plan to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to  shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   first empire had repurchased  common shares pursuant to such plan at an average cost of per share 
including prior repurchase plans completed in and  first empire repurchased common shares totaling  in   in and  in the total cost of these common stock repurchases was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least and  respectively  of risk adjusted total assets 
in addition to the risk based measures  federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of of the quarterly average of total assets 
under regulatory guidelines  unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale are not recognized in determining regulatory capital 
as previously noted  core capital includes the million of trust preferred securities issued in as of december  total capital further includes million of the subordinated notes issued by m t bank in prior years 
the capital ratios of the company and its banking subsidiaries  m t bank and m t bank  na  as of december  are presented in note of notes to financial statements 
the company has historically maintained capital ratios in excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through a high rate of internal capital generation 
the rate of internal capital generation  or net income excluding the after tax effects of gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of average total stockholders equity  was in  in and in year initiatives the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of year issues on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computer systems 
the year problem relates to the ability of computer systems to be able to distinguish date data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
management anticipates that the company s computer systems will be year compliant by the end of and has a planned program to test for such compliance 
the company could also be adversely affected if its customers rely on data processing systems that are not year compliant prior to the end of the company  therefore  is taking a proactive role to work with its data processing vendors and to provide information to its commercial customers regarding year issues 
the costs that have been incurred by the company in addressing its potential year problems have not had a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the inability of the company or its customers to resolve year issues in a timely manner could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company is devoting appropriate resources to resolve its year issues in a timely manner and does not currently expect that doing so will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future
