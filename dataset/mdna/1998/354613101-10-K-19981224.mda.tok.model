item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general franklin resources  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the company derive substantially all of their revenues and net income from providing investment management  administration  distribution and related services to the franklin  templeton and mutual series funds  institutional accounts and other investment products collectively  the franklin templeton group 
the company has a diversified base of assets under management and a full range of investment products and services to meet the needs of most individuals and institutions 
at september   the company offered its services in a number of global markets  featuring offices in over different nations in six different continents and employing over  people 
on november   the company acquired the assets and liabilities of heine securities corporation heine the acquisition  the former investment advisor to what is now known as franklin mutual series fund inc  other funds and private accounts mutual 
see notes and to the financial statements and the outline of useful lives of intangible assets included in this discussion under operating expenses 
assets under management in billions as of september  franklin templeton group equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid funds fixed income tax free taxable domestic primarily us government global international total fixed income money funds total end of period monthly average for the year hybrid funds include asset allocation  balanced  flexible and income mixed funds as defined by the investment company institute 
previously these funds had been included primarily in the equity category 
the company s revenues are derived largely from the amount and composition of assets under management 
assets under management at september   were billion lower than they were at september  this decline in assets occurred primarily as a result of market depreciation in equity portfolios during the last fiscal quarter of  as stock markets adjusted to global equity turmoil 
purchases exceeded redemptions by billion for the fiscal year  and in each fiscal quarter except the last  where redemptions exceeded purchases by billion 
during the year fixed income and money fund assets grew and  respectively  as the result of net fund inflows and market appreciation of tax free funds 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  amounts included in the consolidated statements of income of franklin resources  inc and the percentage change in those amounts from period to period

net income and diluted earnings per share for increased by and  respectively  also principally as a result of increased investment management fee revenues 
operating revenues investment management fees  the largest component of the company s operating revenues  are generally calculated under fixed fee arrangements  as a percentage of the value of assets under management 
under various investment management agreements  annual rates vary and generally decline as the average net assets of the portfolios exceed certain threshold levels 
the majority of mutual fund investment management contracts are subject to periodic approval by each fund s board of directors trustees 
there have been no significant changes in the investment management fee structures for the franklin templeton group in the periods under review 
the company s investment management fee revenues are generally affected by market appreciation or depreciation in assets under management as well as the flow of funds into or out of these portfolios 
during  the company reclassified revenues relating to the distribution component of canadian revenues from investment management fees to underwriting and distribution fees 
the company believes this change more closely matches revenue generated from distribution services with the expenses incurred 
prior periods have been reclassified accordingly 
investment management fees increased and in fiscal and  respectively  due to the and increase in average assets under management during these periods 
these increases reflect both market appreciation and net purchases of mutual funds 
the company s effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by average assets under management remained relatively stable in at compared to in the rate increased significantly from due to a shift in the company s asset mix toward more equity products which generally have higher fee rates 
this shift was primarily the result of the addition of mutual series products to the company s asset mix and the general growth in equity funds 
future changes in the composition of assets under management may affect the effective investment management fee rates earned by the company 
certain subsidiaries of the company act as distributors for its sponsored funds and receive commissions and distribution fees 
underwriting commissions are earned primarily from fund sales 
distribution fees are generally based on the level of assets under management 
these distribution fees include b fees  paid by the funds in reimbursement for distribution expenses incurred up to a maximum allowed by each fund 
a significant portion of underwriting commissions and distribution fees are paid to selling intermediaries 
see the discussion of the reclassification of investment management fees above 
underwriting and distribution fees increased and in and  respectively  primarily as a result of increases in mutual fund sales and average assets under management 
shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
shareholder servicing fees increased and in and  respectively 
the increases were a result of an increase in fund shareholder accounts  as well as an increase in the average per account charge for certain funds during the second quarter of both and other  net consists primarily of revenues from the company s banking and finance subsidiaries  net of interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
other  net increased and in and  respectively  primarily as a result of lower loan loss provision charges at the company s banking and finance subsidiaries 
actual gross charge offs decreased in compared with a decrease in revenues remained relatively stable as a result of increased effective yields offset by and declines in average loans receivable  in and  respectively 
banking finance interest expense decreased in the current periods due to a reduction in the average borrowing requirements of the banking finance group combined with a reduction in effective interest rates 
as described in note to the financial statements  the securitization of approximately million of auto loans that occurred in september did not have a material impact on operating revenues or results of operations 
the company has considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance subsidiaries of a basis point movement in market interest rates and does not expect it would have a material impact on the company s operating revenues or results of operations 
operating expenses underwriting and distribution includes sales commissions and distribution fees paid to brokers and other third party intermediaries 
during both and  underwriting and distribution expenses increased consistent with increased mutual fund sales and average assets under management 
compensation and benefits increased and in and  respectively  reflecting an increase in the number of full time employees and in temporary labor costs 
the company experienced upward pressure on compensation and benefits due to the company s growth and expansion and due to the effects of a very competitive labor market 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased and in and  respectively 
during the past two years  the company has embarked upon major systems implementations  year corrections and european monetary unit preparations  and has upgraded its network  desktop and internet environments 
the company anticipates that such major systems undertakings will continue to have an impact on the company s operating results through the year and beyond 
see the year discussion below 
advertising and promotion expenses increased and in and  respectively  mainly due to increased promotional activity and new marketing campaigns 
sales commissions on certain franklin templeton group products sold without a front end sales charge are capitalized and amortized over periods not exceeding four years the period in which management estimates that they will be recovered from distribution plan payments and from contingent deferred sales charges 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased and  respectively  during the periods under review as sales of these products increased 
amortization of intangibles increased in and as a result of the acquisition see note to the financial statements 
the company has made a determination to amortize goodwill and management contracts over a period of years 
important factors in arriving at this conclusion include the relative stability of the mutual fund industry  industry turnover rates of investment management contracts  the company s own experience  and its performance expectations regarding acquisitions 
other income expense investment income increased in due to the investment of increased operating cash flows 
investment and other income declined in as a result of the sale of a portion of the company s investment portfolio used to finance the acquisition 
interest expense decreased in  primarily due to increased operating cash flows and to the capitalization of interest related to borrowings used to finance construction of a number of new office buildings in during  interest expense increased due to borrowings related to the acquisition 
taxes on income the company s effective income tax rate decreased from approximately in fiscal and in fiscal to approximately of pretax income in fiscal due to the relative proportion of non us pretax income and the effects of tax law changes 
the effective tax rate will continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
financial condition at september   the company s assets aggregated billion  up from billion at september  stockholders equity approximated billion compared to approximately billion at september  the increase in assets and stockholders equity was primarily a result of increased net income outstanding debt long term and short term remained relatively stable at million at september   compared to million at september  the company s ratio of earnings before taxes to fixed charges interest and the interest factor on rent improved to for compared to for the company s interest coverage ratio pretax income before interest expense divided by interest expense was for as compared to for the company s overall weighted average interest rate at september   including the effect of interest rate swap agreements  was on million of outstanding commercial paper and notes payable medium term notes as compared to on million of such debt outstanding at september  cash provided by operating activities increased to million in  from million and million in and  respectively 
during the year ended september   the company used net cash of million for investing activities 
million was used to purchase investments  million was used to purchase property and equipment and million was related to the acquisition 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the securitization of auto loans and sales of investments 
net cash used in financing activities during the year was million  compared to million provided by financing activities in  primarily as a result of million less debt issued in during fiscal  the company paid million in dividends to stockholders and purchased  shares of its common stock for million 
the company s auto loan and credit card receivables business activities are subject to fluctuations in those consumer market places  as well as to competition from companies with much larger receivable portfolios 
auto loan and credit card portfolio results can also be influenced significantly by trends in the economy and credit markets that may negatively impact borrowers ability to repay loans 
credit card and auto loans receivable decreased from levels due to the impact of a securitization of auto loans with a net book value of approximately million in september the company used the proceeds of million to reduce the company s debt and to supplement working capital 
as a result of its more stringent underwriting policies  improved auto loan collection efforts and enhanced systems supporting those activities  the company has experienced a decrease in loan losses since september  any future increases in the company s investment in dealer auto loan and credit card portfolios are expected to be funded either through existing debt facilities and operating cash flows or through future securitizations of the portfolios 
liquidity and capital resources at september   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september  liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale and current receivables increased to  million at september  from million at september  revolving credit facilities at september  aggregated million of which million was under a day facility 
the remaining million facility will expire in may at september   approximately million was available to the company under unused commercial paper and medium term note programs 
management expects that the principal needs for cash will be to advance sales commissions  fund increased property and equipment acquisitions including information systems  pay stockholder dividends and service debt 
management believes that the company s existing liquid assets  together with the expected continuing cash flow from operations  its borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and its ability to issue stock will be sufficient to meet its present and reasonably foreseeable cash needs 
results of operations will continue to be dependent upon general economic growth  the strength of capital markets and the company s ability to meet investor demands with competitive products and services 
operating revenues will be dependent upon the amount and composition of assets under management  mutual fund sales  and the number of mutual fund investors  private and institutional clients 
despite the company s global presence  a substantial portion of its foreign subsidiaries revenues and the majority of their monetary assets are us and canadian dollar denominated 
over of the company s operating revenues were earned in us and canadian dollars in both and despite increased fluctuation in world currency markets  the company s exposure is limited and the company has not deemed it necessary to enter into foreign currency hedging activities 
the company participates in the financial derivatives markets to manage its exposure to variable interest rate fluctuations on a portion of its commercial paper 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert interest payment obligations under variable rate debt instruments to fixed rate interest payment obligations 
through its interest rate swap agreements and medium term note program  the company has fixed the rates of interest it pays on of its outstanding debt 
see note to the financial statements 
year readiness disclosure background 
many of the world s computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems may be unable to recognize  interpret or use dates in and beyond the year correctly 
because the activities of many businesses are affected by dates or are date related  the inability to use such date information correctly could lead to business disruptions both in the united states and internationally the year problem 
year impact 
the company s businesses rely on a complex international network of computer and communications systems which are owned and operated by the company and by third parties 
the short time frames within which securities prices must be transmitted and received  trade orders placed and taken  and monies transferred all utilizing these systems increases the potential impact of the year problem for the securities industry 
the company is most dependent upon its mission critical systems  those that are required to perform its core business activities 
the most important of these is its domestic transfer agency system  which is the shareholder record keeping system used to process transactions for the majority of the company s mutual fund shareholders 
the transfer agency system is a third party system which interfaces with the company s internal sub systems 
although the vendor of the transfer agency system has contractually committed to the company that the system will be made year compliant  the vendor presently is behind in its timetable to achieve such compliance 
because certain mission critical sub systems cannot be tested until the transfer agency system is made year compliant  the time frame for testing and any remediation of these sub systems has been shortened 
notwithstanding such delays  the company believes that it will complete its required testing in a time frame necessary to participate in the securities industry association sia testing currently scheduled to begin in march the year plan 
as the year plan progresses  the company will focus on year certification of its core mission critical information technology it systems  prioritizing them over other it systems  and prioritizing it systems in general over non it systems 
because the year project is an ongoing company wide endeavor  the state of the company s progress changes daily 
the company s year compliance plan is comprised of four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company currently plans to complete all phases of its year plan with respect to mission critical systems by september and with respect to other important systems as soon as possible thereafter  but in any event by december  due to the large number of systems used worldwide by the company  it is most useful to focus on the status of mission critical systems  as outlined below 
phase of of mission project critical complete assessment remediation testing implementation assessment systems are inventoried  budgets and strategies are created to address identified problems 
remediation software corrections  upgrades and other fixes are made  questionnaires requesting year compliance assurances are sent to vendors and  in some cases  test scripts are requested 
testing internal systems are tested on a stand alone basis  point to point testing between the company and third parties is conducted for some systems 
implementation systems that have been identified as being year compliant are put into normal business operation  end user training is conducted 
non it systems 
other than third party long distance telephone and data lines and public utility electrical power  the company s business operations are not heavily dependent on non it components or systems  and none of the company s mission critical systems is a non it system 
the company estimates that it has completed approximately to of its assessment of the company owned or managed non it components including building  mechanical  air conditioning  electrical and security systems 
third parties and year the company s business operations are heavily dependent upon a complex worldwide network of it systems that are owned and managed by third parties  including data feeds  trading systems  securities transfer agent operations and stock market links 
the company has contacted all of its major external suppliers of goods  services and data other than suppliers of electricity or long distance data and voicelines to assess their compliance efforts and the company s exposure in the event of a failure of third party compliance efforts 
the company is in the process of validating and reviewing the responses from these suppliers of mission critical systems and in some cases is seeking additional information  written assurances of certification  or test scripts 
cost estimates 
the total estimated costs associated with the required modifications to become year compliant range from million to million  not all of which is incremental to the company s operations 
the estimated costs consist mainly of internal and third party labor costs which are expensed as incurred 
the total amount expended on the project through september  was approximately million 
the company believes that its existing liquid assets  together with expected cash flow from operations  combined with its borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund anticipated expenditures 
the company s estimates of the total costs to complete the year project will continue to be refined in future periods 
as is indicated in the analysis above  approximately to of the expected costs of the year project have not yet been incurred 
the company anticipates that its expenditures will increase during the next fiscal year as it moves the majority of its efforts from the relatively inexpensive assessment phase to the more costly phases of testing and remediation 
contingency planning 
the company is beginning to develop a contingency plan  including identification of those mission critical systems for which it is practical to develop a contingency plan 
however  in an operation as complex and geographically distributed as the company s business there are limited alternatives to certain of its mission critical systems or public utilities 
if certain public utilities or mission critical systems  such as the company s domestic transfer agency system  are not made year compliant or fail  there would be a material adverse impact upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company is investigating alternative solutions  it is unlikely that any adequate contingency plan can be developed for such failures 
european monetary unit the euro on january   a single currency for the european economic and monetary union is scheduled to replace the national currency for participating member countries which include countries in which the company has offices or with which it does substantial business 
many of the company s managed funds and financial products have substantial investments in countries whose currencies will be replaced by the euro 
all aspects of the company s investment process  including trading  foreign exchange  payments  settlements  cash accounts  custodial accounts and accounting will be affected by the implementation of the euro the euro issue 
the company has created an interdepartmental team to address the euro issue and is communicating with its external partners and vendors to assess their readiness to manage the euro issue 
the establishment of the euro may result in market volatility  expose investments to currency risk due to fluctuations in multiple currencies  change the economic environment and behavior of investors  or change the competitive environment for the company s business in europe 
similarly  companies operating in more than one country  such as the company  may gain or lose competitive advantages because of the euro in ways that are not predictable 
it is not currently possible to predict the impact of the euro on the business or financial condition of european issuers which company sponsored funds may hold in their portfolios or the impact on the value of fund shares 
the company is not presently able to assess the cost impact of the euro issue on the company  but does not presently anticipate that it will have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flows  operations or operating results 
the company is generally expensing costs incurred relating to the euro issue during the period in which they are incurred 
specific risks associated with the year and the euro 
the company s ability to manage the year problem and the euro issue are subject to uncertainties beyond its control that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that could influence the effect of the year problem and the euro issue include the success of the company in identifying systems and programs that are affected by the year problem and the euro issue for example  it is possible that the sia testing may reveal additional problems in the company s systems 
other facts include the nature and amount of testing  remediation  programming  installation and systems work required to upgrade or to replace each of the affected programs or systems  the rate  magnitude and availability of related labor and consulting costs  the success of the company in correcting its internal systems and the success of the company s external partners and suppliers in addressing their respective year problems and the euro issue 
the failure of organizations such as those mentioned above under third parties and year to resolve their own issues with respect to the year problem or the euro issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could become subject to legal claims in the event of any year or euro problem in the company s business operations 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities which could impose sanctions or fines or cause the company to cease operations 
also  investors concerned about the year problem or the euro issue could withdraw monies from the company s funds resulting in a decline in assets under management which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

notes to consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies franklin resources  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the company derive substantially all of their revenues and net income from providing investment management  administration  distribution and related services to the franklin  templeton and mutual series funds  institutional accounts and other investment products the franklin templeton group that operate in the united states  canada  europe and other international markets under various rules and regulations set forth by the securities and exchange commission  individual state agencies and foreign governments 
services to the franklin templeton group are provided under contracts that set forth the fees to be charged for these services 
the majority of these contracts are subject to periodic review and approval by each fund s board of directors trustees and shareholders 
currently  no fund s revenues represent more than of total revenues 
company revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under management  which include domestic and international equity and debt portfolios 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact the company s revenues and operating results 
basis of presentation 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the use of estimates made by the company s management 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates 
certain and amounts have been reclassified to conform to presentation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of franklin resources  inc and its majority owned subsidiaries 
all material inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated except the inter company payable from the banking finance group to the parent to fund auto and credit card loans 
operating revenues of the banking finance group are included in other net and are presented net of related interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
accordingly  reported interest expense excludes interest expense attributable to the banking finance group 
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  demand deposits with banks  debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less and other highly liquid investments  including money market funds  which are readily convertible into cash 
due to the relatively short term nature of these instruments  the carrying value approximates fair value 
investment securities  available for sale are carried at fair value 
fair values for investments in the franklin templeton group are based on the last reported net asset value 
fair values for other investments are based on the last reported price on the exchange on which they are traded 
realized gains and losses are included in investment income currently based on specific identification 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
derivatives 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce variable interest rate exposure with respect to its commercial paper 
under these agreements the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the interest rate differential between the fixed pay rate and the variable receive rate is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
at september  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires that the company recognize derivative instruments at fair value in its financial statements 
as a result  on september  the company recognized a net interest rate swap liability of million  estimated using the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
unrealized gains and losses on these instruments are recorded net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity 
these unrealized gains and losses are recognized only on early termination of the agreements 
the company has not  and does not intend to  terminate these agreements prior to their normal expiration 
loans receivable 
interest on auto installment loans is accrued principally using the rule of s method  which approximates the interest method 
interest on all other loans is accrued using the simple interest method 
an allowance for loan losses is established monthly based on historical experience  including delinquency and loss trends 
a loan is charged to the allowance when it is deemed to be uncollectible  taking into consideration the value of the collateral  the financial condition of the borrower and other factors 
recoveries on loans previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
deferred sales commissions 
sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries in connection with the sale of shares of the franklin templeton group sold without a front end sales charge are capitalized and amortized over periods not exceeding four years the periods in which management estimates that they will be recovered from distribution plan payments and from contingent deferred sales charges 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on the straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred 
leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
intangible assets  consisting principally of the estimated value of mutual fund management contracts and goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of the assets of templeton  galbraith hansberger ltd 
and heine securities corporation  are being amortized on a straight line basis over various lives ranging from to years 
the company has evaluated the potential impairment of its intangible assets on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows without interest charges to be derived from these assets in relation to the company s carrying values and has determined that there is no impairment 
at some future period  if such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets will be adjusted to their fair values 
recognition of revenues 
investment management fees  shareholder servicing fees  investment income and distribution fees are all recognized as earned 
underwriting commissions related to the sale of the shares of the franklin templeton group are recorded on the trade date 
advertising and promotion 
costs of advertising and promotion are expensed as the advertising appears in the media 
foreign currency translation 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates as of the end of the accounting period  and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period 
net exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are excluded from income and are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in income currently 
stock splits 
all common shares and per share amounts have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to a three for two stock split declared december and a two for one stock split declared december stockholders equity as of september  and has not been restated 
dividends 
during the years ended september   and  the company declared dividends to common stockholders of  and  respectively 
earnings per share 
during the year ended september   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share fas 
fas requires companies to present basic and diluted earnings per share eps  instead of primary and fully diluted eps which were formerly required 
the new standard also makes certain modifications to eps calculations 
under fas  diluted eps amounts are computed by reflecting the potential impact of stock options and restricted stock awards 
the impact on previously reported eps was not material 
the weighted average number of shares and common stock equivalents used in computing eps in  and were in thousands   and  for basic and   and  for diluted  respectively 
stock based compensation 
as allowed under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  the company has elected to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based plans 
accordingly  no compensation costs are recognized with respect to stock options granted  nor with respect to shares issued under the employee stock investment plan 
compensation expense is recognized for the matching contribution that the company may elect to make in connection with the employee stock investment plan over the eighteen month holding period and for the full cost of restricted stock grants in the year that they are earned 
note acquisition on november   the company acquired the assets and liabilities of heine securities corporation heine the acquisition  the former investment advisor to what is now known as franklin mutual series fund inc  other funds and private accounts mutual 
one of the company s subsidiaries  franklin mutual advisers  inc  now serves as the investment adviser to mutual

agreed upon growth targets range from to of management fee revenues from mutual over a five year period from the date of the acquisition 
payments are pro rated based upon the upper and lower range of the targets 
the first contingent payment of million related to these agreed upon growth targets was made in the third quarter of fiscal and was accounted for as goodwill related to additional purchase price of the acquisition 
other payments are due in fiscal and if growth targets are met
