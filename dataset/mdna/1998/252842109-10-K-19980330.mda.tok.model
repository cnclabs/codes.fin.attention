item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary disease specific radiopharmaceuticals for the diagnosis and treatment of life threatening conditions such cancer  infection  and cardiovascular disease 
to date  the company has not received revenue from the sale of products 
in order to commercialize products  the company will need to address a number of technological challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
the company has received a letter from the fda stating that the company s nda for acutect is approvable  subject to diatide clarifying certain details and formally agreeing to conduct certain phase clinical studies 
the company expects to receive final fda approval and introduce acutect to the market in the us by the end of however  the fda has not yet granted such marketing approval  and there can be no assurance that such approval in fact will be granted or as to the timing of such approval 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the amount of funds that will be required or the length of time that will pass before the company receives revenues from sales of its products  including acutect 
all revenues received by the company through december  have resulted from research grants from the national institutes of health the nih and the department of defense collectively  the research grants  fees received for entering into option agreements with a pharmaceutical company  and research and development support payments and the acutect option exercise payments for acutect and p and the acutect milestone payment from nycomed under the company s collaborative agreements with nycomed 
the company has incurred net losses since its inception 
no revenues have been generated from product sales and no product sales revenues are anticipated until late in the company expects to incur additional significant operating losses over the next to months and expects its cumulative net losses to increase significantly as the company s research and development and clinical trial efforts expand 
the company expects that its research and development expenses during will be at approximately the same level as in as the company continues more advanced preclinical studies and late stage clinical trials and makes filings for regulatory approvals 
the company expects that its personnel and patent costs will increase in the future 
patent costs also would increase if the company became involved in litigation or administrative proceedings involving its patents or those of third parties 
beginning in  the company will incur manufacturing  marketing  sales  and distribution costs to support the anticipated commercialization of acutect 
the company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception through december  of results of operation years ended december  and revenues

net loss 
as a result of the above factors  the company incurred net losses of  and  in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in september  the company issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to three institutional investors in a private offering  raising million of net proceeds 
the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock in june  raising approximately million of net proceeds 
as of december   the company had  of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital of  during and  the company s capital expenditures totaled  and   respectively  primarily for the acquisition of laboratory and computer equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures to approximate the level 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress in its research and product development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs and success of commercialization activities and arrangements  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative academic and commercial research  development and marketing relationships 
based upon its current operating plan  the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements through mid substantial additional funds may be required from external sources to support the company s operations beyond that time  although there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available  or  if available  that such funds will be available on acceptable terms 
the company intends to seek additional equity  debt and lease financing to fund future operations  depending upon the terms on which such sources of funding may be available from time to time 
in addition  the company intends to seek additional collaborative development and commercialization relationships with potential corporate partners in order to fund certain of its programs  including the future development and commercialization of sn m dtpa and the theratide program 
except for research and development funding from nycomed pursuant to its collaboration with diatide which is subject to early termination in certain circumstances  the company has no committed external sources of capital  and  as discussed above  expects to incur additional significant operating losses for a number of years 
if the company is unable to obtain necessary additional funds  it would be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of its research and development programs or commercialization efforts or license to third parties certain technologies which the company would otherwise pursue on its own 
year the management of the company has analyzed its computer hardware and software in connection with potential dating problems that may arise with the year management s determination is that many potential problems can be corrected by the year  and the related costs are not expected to materially impact the company 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forwarding looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
certain factors that may affect future results early stage of development  technological uncertainty diatide was founded in february and has not yet introduced any product into the market 
all but one of the company s potential products are in research or development and will require additional research and development  extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales 
the company must successfully address a number of technological challenges to complete certain of its development efforts 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be permitted to undertake and complete human clinical trials of any of the company s potential products  either in the united states or elsewhere  or  if permitted  that such products will be demonstrated to be safe and efficacious 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of the company s potential products will obtain fda or other regulatory approval for any indication or that an approved product will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and successfully marketed 
see item business 
the use of synthetic peptides in radiopharmaceuticals  which is central to the company s technology  is new to nuclear medicine 
the company is aware of only one imaging product and no therapeutics based on this scientific approach that have been approved for sale by the fda 
the products for which the company has submitted or currently plans to submit ind applications and all of the company s other potential products in research or development may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects in humans or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use 
unproven safety and effectiveness of potential products  uncertainties related to clinical trials before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of its products under development  the company must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and efficacious for use in each indication 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in large scale clinical trials  and there can be no assurance that the company s clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any products or will result in marketable products 
a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
the company  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time 
the company relies on scientific  technical and clinical data supplied by its academic collaborators and licensors in the evaluation and development of potential products  including sn m dtpa  which was licensed from bnl 
bnl conducted the phase i and the phase ii clinical trials of the compound 
there can be no assurance that there are no errors or omissions in such data that would materially adversely affect the development of such products 
the rate of completion of the company s clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs  program delays  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company relies  in part  on clinical research organizations to conduct its clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that such entities will conduct the clinical trials successfully 
the company is currently conducting clinical trials with respect to certain of its techtides and plans to continue clinical trials of its therapeutic radiopharmaceutical  sn m dtpa 
there can be no assurance that any of these clinical trials will be successfully completed within any specified time period  if at all 
there also can be no assurance that the results from any of these clinical trials will warrant the commencement of further clinical trials or that the company will not encounter problems in these or other clinical trials which would cause the company or the fda to delay or suspend the trials 
in phase i clinical trials of one of its techtides  ph for the medical imaging of infection due to inflammation  the compound concentrated in patients stomachs at unexpectedly high levels 
as a result  the company conducted additional preclinical testing of this compound and alternative compounds in animals to determine the cause of this phenomenon and recently initiated a new phase i clinical trial of a new formulation of ph 
in a pilot study of a compound for medical imaging of atherosclerotic plaque  the company determined that the compound did not exhibit sufficient sensitivity to warrant continuing development of the compound 
the company currently is synthesizing new compounds for this application and screening them in animal models

no assurance of regulatory approval  extensive government regulation the production and the marketing of the company s products and the company s ongoing research and development activities are and will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states 
the company has had only limited experience in filing or pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals 
preclinical testing of the company s product development candidates is subject to glp requirements and the manufacture of any products developed by the company will be subject to gmp requirements prescribed by the fda 
the regulatory process  which includes preclinical studies  clinical trials and ongoing post approval testing of each compound to establish or monitor its safety and effectiveness  takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
the company has limited experience in filing or pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that  even after the performance of clinical studies  and the passage of time and the expenditure of such resources  regulatory approval will be obtained for any products developed by the company 
the company s analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities which could delay  limit or prevent fda regulatory approval 
the company or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if the participants in such trials are being exposed to unanticipated or unacceptable health risks 
moreover  if regulatory approval to market a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
fda policy may change and additional government regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s potential products 
in addition  a marketed product  its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections  and subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
all of the foregoing regulatory matters also will be applicable to development  manufacturing and marketing undertaken by any strategic partners of the company 
there can be no assurance that additional statutes or regulations applicable to the company s business will not be adopted  impose substantial additional costs or otherwise adversely affect the company s operations 
the use  handling  storage and disposal of products containing radioisotopes  such as sn m dtpa and sources of technetium  are regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission and by state authorities 
enforcement of existing laws and regulations or future amendments or limitations thereto could have a material adverse effect on the market for radiopharmaceuticals and on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is also subject to numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements governing the design and conduct of clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of its products 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval set forth above  and there can be no assurance that foreign regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the company or its strategic marketing partners will file for regulatory approvals or receive necessary approvals to commercialize its products in any market 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals  or the loss of previously received approvals  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
uncertainty of market acceptance of technology and products the commercial success of the company s products  when and if approved for marketing by the fda  will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
the synthetic peptide based radiopharmaceutical technology being developed by the company is relatively new 
to date  the company is aware of only one imaging product and no therapeutic products based on this scientific approach that has been approved for sale by the fda 
peptide based radiopharmaceuticals have not been extensively tested in humans 
market acceptance and thus  sales of the company s products  will depend on several factors  including the receipt of regulatory approval in the united states  europe  the far east and elsewhere  safety  price  ease of administration and effectiveness and extensive physician education 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will gain market acceptance 
failure to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the midac recommendation and the fda s approvable letter are not guarantees of final approval for acutect 
while the company expects to be able to commercially market acutect in  final marketing approval of the company s products  including acutect  is beyond the company s control  and there is no guarantee that the company will  in fact  be able to market the product in the us or europe within any previously stated time frame 
see item business government regulation 
need to establish collaborative commercial relationships  dependence on partners diatide s business strategy includes entering into strategic alliances or marketing and distribution arrangements with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical companies  for the development  commercialization and marketing and distribution of certain of its potential products worldwide 
to date  the company is a party to a collaborative arrangement with only one corporate partner  nycomed 
there can be no assurance that the arrangement with nycomed will be scientifically or commercially successful 
in the event that this arrangement is terminated  such action might adversely affect the company s ability to develop  commercialize  market and distribute certain of its potential products 
in addition  the company does not plan to conduct extensive phase clinical trials of sn m dtpa unless it enters into a corporate collaboration for the completion of the development and the commercialization of sn m dtpa 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate any additional collaborative or marketing and distribution arrangements  that such arrangements will be available to the company on acceptable terms or that any such relationships  if established  will be scientifically or commercially successful 
the company s product candidates will only generate milestone payments and royalties from collaborators upon the occurrence of significant preclinical and clinical development  requisite regulatory approvals  the establishment of manufacturing capabilities and successful marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company s collaborative partners will not be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including the company s competitors  as a means for developing imaging agents or treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs 
for example  nycomed manufactures and distributes a wide variety of imaging agents for other modalities that may compete against the products that nycomed licenses from diatide or co markets with diatide 
the company s business also will be affected by the success of its corporate partners in marketing any successfully developed products within the geographic areas in which such partners are granted marketing rights 
a reduction in sales efforts or a discontinuance of sales of the company s products by collaborative or corporate partners  who are not within the control of the company  may result in reduced revenues and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

history of operating losses and accumulated deficit  uncertainty of future profitability diatide has incurred net losses since its inception 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
no revenues have been generated from product sales  and no product sales revenues are anticipated until late in the company expects to incur additional significant operating losses over the next to months and expects cumulative losses to increase significantly as the company s research and development and clinical trial efforts expand 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
the company s ability to achieve profitability is dependent in part on obtaining regulatory approvals for its products  entering into satisfactory agreements with pharmaceutical corporate partners for research and development and commercialization of its products and developing the capacity to manufacture  market and sell its products or entering into satisfactory arrangements for such manufacture  marketing and sale with third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain required regulatory approvals  enter into any additional agreements for drug discovery  development and commercialization  develop the capacity to manufacture and sell its products or enter into arrangements therefor with third parties or ever achieve sales or profitability 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress in its research and product development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative academic and commercial research  development and marketing relationships  and the costs and success of commercialization activities and arrangements 
based upon its current operating plan  the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements through mid it is possible that in the future the company may be required to raise additional funds  including through collaborative relationships and public or private financings 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available  or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
additionally  the terms of the financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the then existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to significantly curtail one or more of its research or product development programs  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products which the company would otherwise pursue on its own

intense competition and risk of technological obsolescence there are many companies  both private and publicly traded  that are conducting extensive research and development activities on technologies and products similar to or competitive with the company s technologies and proposed products 
for example  many other companies are actively seeking to develop nuclear medicine imaging agents that will compete with the company s techtides 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technology similar to the company s proprietary process of radiolabeling peptides with technetium used in the company s techtides 
the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid and substantial technological change and there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing products which are more effective than any that are being developed by the company  or which would render diatide s technologies and products obsolete and noncompetitive 
for example  diagnostic imaging tests may be developed that are more cost effective and have superior imaging quality than the company s tests or new radiopharmaceuticals may be developed that have superior targeting and binding qualities than the company s techtides 
certain radiopharmaceuticals already have been approved for sale for the diagnosis or treatment of the indications targeted by the company s products under development 
in particular  octreoscan r  a peptide based radiopharmaceutical  is available for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors  ceretec r  a radiopharmaceutical labeled with technetium  is available for imaging inflammation due to infection  and metastron r and quadramet r are available for the reduction of pain due to metastatic cancer to the bone 
there are several well established medical imaging modalities that currently  and will continue to  compete against nuclear medicine imaging  including x rays  ct  mri and ultrasound  and there are alternative therapeutics available for the treatment of the cancer indications that are the subject of the company s therapeutic programs 
the company has numerous competitors in the united states and internationally  which include  among others  pharmaceutical and chemical companies  biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
large pharmaceutical companies with significant research  development  marketing and manufacturing operations in the nuclear medicine field include du pont merck and mallinckrodt 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than the company 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products for use in health care 
accordingly  the company s competitors may succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for products more rapidly than the company 
furthermore  if the company is permitted to commence commercial sales of products  it will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which it has limited or no experience 
see item business competition 
uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights the company s success will depend in part on its ability to develop patentable products  enforce its patents and obtain patent protection for its products both in the united states and in other countries 
the company intends to file applications as appropriate for patents covering both its products and processes 
however  the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including diatide  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no assurance can be given that patents will issue from any patent applications owned by or licensed to diatide or that  if patents do issue  the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  no assurance can be given that any issued patents owned by or licensed to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
the commercial success of the company will also depend in part on its neither infringing patents issued to competitors or others nor breaching the technology licenses upon which the company s products might be based 
the company s licenses of patents and patent applications impose various commercialization  sublicensing  royalty and other payment  insurance and other obligations on the company 
failure of the company to comply with these requirements could result in conversion of the licenses from being exclusive to nonexclusive in nature or termination of the licenses 
the company is aware of patents and patent applications belonging to competitors  and it is uncertain whether these patents and patent applications will require the company to alter its products or processes  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities 
competitors of the company and other third parties hold issued patents and pending patent applications which may result in claims of infringement against the company or other patent litigation 
in particular  the company is aware of one european patent issued to a pharmaceutical company which  if valid  may be infringed by p the holder of this patent has indicated to the company that it is not prepared to offer a license under the patent to the company 
in addition  the company is aware of one us patent assigned to another company that claims the same invention as a pending diatide patent application and may apply to an element of acutect 
the company has requested that the pto declare an interference with respect to such patent 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully obtain a license to any technology that it may require or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost or on an exclusive basis 
failure by the company to obtain a license to any technology that it may require to commercialize its products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see item business patents  trade secrets and licenses 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to the company  may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to the company and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
the company also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the pto  which could result in substantial cost to the company  to determine the priority of inventions 
furthermore  the company may have to participate at substantial cost in international trade commission proceedings to abate importation of products which would compete unfairly with products of the company 
diatide engages in collaborations  sponsored research agreements and other agreements with academic researchers and institutions and united states government agencies 
under the terms of such agreements  third parties may have rights in certain inventions developed during the course of the performance of such collaborations and agreements 
the company relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how which it seeks to protect  in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants  members of its scientific advisory board  outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see item business patents  trade secrets and licenses 
absence of sales and marketing experience although diatide plans to rely significantly on collaborative partners for the marketing and distribution of its products through co marketing or other licensing or distribution arrangements  the company expects to market and sell certain of its products directly and to engage in certain other marketing activities in collaboration with its collaborative partners 
the company has no experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
however  the company is actively developing its sales and marketing organization to support the anticipated fda approval of acutect in to the extent the company enters into marketing or distribution arrangements with collaborative partners  any revenues the company receives will depend upon the efforts of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any third party will market the company s products successfully or that any third party collaboration will be on terms favorable to the company 
if any marketing partner does not market a product successfully  the company s business would be materially adversely affected 
if diatide s plan to rely on corporate partners for significant aspects of marketing and selling the company s products is unsuccessful for any reason  diatide may need to recruit and train a far larger marketing and sales force than it currently anticipates doing  which would entail the incurrence of significant additional costs 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to attract and build a sufficient marketing staff or sales force  that the cost of establishing such a marketing staff or sales force will be justifiable in light of any product revenues or that the company s direct sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
in addition  if the company succeeds in bringing one or more products to market  it may compete with other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s marketing and sales efforts would enable it to compete successfully against such other companies 
see item business marketing and distribution and corporate collaborations 
limited manufacturing capability  dependence on sole source supplier the company lacks commercial scale facilities to manufacture its products in accordance with current gmp requirements prescribed by the fda 
to date  the company has relied on a large third party pharmaceutical company for the manufacture of its peptides for clinical trials and has entered into an arrangement with a gmp qualified third party manufacturer for the supply of sn m for clinical trials 
the company expects to be dependent on third party manufacturers or collaborative partners for all of its commercial production of peptides 
there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under gmp regulations capable of manufacturing the company s products 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain contract manufacturing  or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms  it may not be able to commercialize its products as planned 
where third party arrangements are established  the company will depend upon such third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner 
there can be no assurance that third parties depended upon by the company will perform and any failures by third parties may delay clinical trial development or the submission of products for regulatory approval  impair the company s ability to commercialize its products as planned and deliver products on a timely basis  or otherwise impair the company s competitive position  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company purchases its synthetic peptides from a sole source supplier and may enter into similar arrangements with respect to other components of its products 
while the company is aware of alternative sources for its peptides  the establishment of additional or replacement suppliers could be time consuming and result in a supply interruption and significant additional regulatory delays and expense 
the establishment of an alternative source of supply or any significant supply interruption could have a materially adverse effect on the company s ability to develop and manufacture its potential products and  therefore  upon its business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business manufacturing 
if the company determines to develop its own manufacturing capabilities  it will need to recruit qualified personnel and build or lease the requisite facilities and equipment because it has no experience in manufacturing on a commercial scale and no facilities or equipment therefor 
there can be no assurance that diatide will be able to successfully develop its own manufacturing capabilities or as to the cost thereof or the time required 
in addition  the manufacture of any products by the company is subject to regulation by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
delay in complying or failure to comply with such manufacturing requirements could materially adversely affect the marketing of the company s products and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
hazardous materials the company s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling  storing and disposing of such materials and the safety procedures of the third parties who ship such materials for the company comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  the company could be held liable for significant damages and any such liability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
potential product liability exposure and insurance the use of any of the company s potential products in clinical trials and the commercial sale of any products may expose the company to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human diagnostic and therapeutic products 
product liability claims might be made directly by consumers  health care providers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products 
there can be no assurance that product liability claims  if made  would not result in a recall of the company s products or a change in the indications for which they may be used 
diatide has limited product liability insurance coverage  and such coverage is subject to various deductibles 
such coverage is expensive  and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain or obtain such insurance at reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect the company against losses due to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing and adequate reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize its products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of such products and related treatment are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations hmos
