for the year ended december   net income and earnings per share were  or per share compared to million or basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share in this change is principally attributable to costs associated with the company s implementation of a business process reengineering plan which was centered around a new information technology system  that is year compliant and provides the capacity necessary to continue the company s integrated growth strategy into the next millennium 
details of the company s reengineering plan are discussed below 
anicom s gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million or to million versus million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from anicom s acquired sales volume and internal growth 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in compared to in the gross margin improvements that resulted from the economic efficiencies created by anicom s increased purchasing volume were offset by the impact of lower historical gross profit margins of recent acquisitions 
tw  which the company acquired in december has significant operations in the new york city market and carries different  lower margin product offerings than anicom has historically offered 
consequently  management anticipates that gross margins may be less than those reported for management anticipates partially mitigating the impact of tw s historically lower gross margins by increasing the depth and breadth of product offerings maintained in stock at these locations  continuing to leverage our purchasing volume with common vendors and working to develop mutually beneficial arrangements with vendors new to anicom 
selling expenses increased by million for the year ended december  in conjunction with the company s increase in net sales and the increase in sales headcount that resulted from the company s acquisitions and internal growth 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from of net sales in to of net sales in these improvements resulted from the company realizing operating leverage from its growth and acquisitions and conforming the selling incentive programs of companies acquired in with those of anicom 
these improvements were  in part  offset by differences in the selling incentive programs in place at energy  acquired in july as currently structured  anicom s selling incentive program calls for increasing payouts as individual targets are achieved and surpassed 
management has found this program to be an effective tool to incent internal growth 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million the company s acquisitions in the last half of and  non recurring costs related to a product line sold during the first quarter of and non recurring post acquisition integration costs accounted for the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses improved to for the year ended december  from in the year prior 
these improvements were attributable to increases in net sales outpacing required expenses for general and administrative costs as the company further realized operating leverage from its acquisition based  integrated growth strategy 
in the month period from march  to december   the company completed nine acquisitions 
the revenues for these entities in the last fiscal year prior to acquisition by anicom totalled approximately million 
of these nine acquisitions  three were completed within the last six months of and have accounted for approximately million or of the acquired revenue 
as the company developed plans to implement the integration of these businesses into the anicom information technology system  it became clear that the capacity of the existing system would be severally strained and that improved efficiencies could be realized by evaluating each of the company s significant business processes 
this realization  along with the need to upgrade the company s systems to year compliance  resulted in management undertaking a significant business reengineering program 
in the fourth quarter  the company implemented a complete reengineering plan  designed to further improve operating efficiencies within the organization by leveraging the capabilities inherent in the new information system and provide the additional information system capacity to continue the company s integrated growth strategy
