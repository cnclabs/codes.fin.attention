the company s kvm switch products provide up to four users  each with a separate keyboard  video monitor and mouse  with the capability to control up to  pcs  thereby eliminating the need for individual kvm peripherals for the controlled pcs 
elimination of kvm peripherals can provide significant cost reduction lower initial investment and ongoing utility costs and space savings as well as more efficient technical support capabilities 
the company s kvm switch products allow users to control ibm compatible and macintosh pcs and many sun  hewlett packard  digital equipment corporation dec  ibm and silicon graphics workstations functioning either as stand alone systems or as file  communications or servers operating within a lan 
the company also has interfaces for its autoboot xp tm xp tm  which operate with models of ibm rs  hewlett packard  dec s alpha  and silicon graphic s indigo workstations

in addition  certain kvm extension products allow multiple users shared access to the same pc from different kvm peripherals 
the pc extender tm snap  introduced in late fiscal  utilizes standard category utp cabling  a commonly installed cable in ethernet networks  and reduces cabling costs by half 
kvm extension products are particularly useful in congested work areas or where working conditions may be hazardous to the function of the computer 
the company evaluates its products and its customer needs on an ongoing basis to advance its competitive position in the marketplace 
as part of this process  the company seeks expansion not only through internal development but through strategic acquisition and expansion efforts 
consistent with this philosophy  the company completed its acquisition of the polycon companies on december   discussed later herein 
the acquisition of the polycon companies included intellectual property that the company plans to leverage and integrate with its research and development resources worldwide to expand the company s high end console switching products for mid and large scale networks 
the acquisition of the polycon companies is consistent with the company s strategy to expand its operations in europe and immediately adds new customer relationships and expands distribution channels 
the company s net sales have increased in each fiscal year due primarily to increases in the number of units sold to both new and existing customers 
these annual net sales increases reflect the company s strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products as well as increasingly enhanced generations of already accepted products with increased functionality which are price competitive as compared to prior generations of the company s products and to the products of competitors 
as a part of this strategy  the company seeks to be price competitive and to be the high quality provider of products in its markets 
this strategy has enabled the company to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers as well as to increase its market share by selling products to new customers 
the company has broadened its marketing strategy of expanding channels of distribution by increased penetration in the oem market and the worldwide catalog market 
in fiscal  the company announced its first products designed specifically for the oem market 
these products are intended to expand the company s share of sales in the oem marketplace 
during this same period  the company began shipping certain kvm switch products to a major worldwide catalog marketer under private label 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company also began distribution of its branded products with a major distributor 
these relationships have broadened the company s channels of distribution of its products and is expected to increase market share 
the company expanded its marketing strategy to include the retail channel of distribution with the introduction of switchview tm  which targets the desktop market 
switchview tm was designed to address the high volume sales channels and is the company s first product targeted to the mass market 
with the acquisition of the polycon companies  the company is the only kvm switch product manufacturer offering products ranging from the entry level pc single user switch to multi user  multiplatform switches and console switching solutions that can control thousands of computers in data centers and server farms 
the company contracts with third parties to provide completed subassemblies of its products 
the company outsources entire products turnkey for certain stable high volume products 
the company believes that outsourcing manufacturing generally enables the company to control product costs more effectively 
the company continually evaluates new product opportunities and engages in substantial research and product development efforts 
the company expenses all product research and development costs as incurred 
additionally  the company also incurs substantial expenses related to advertising  participation in trade shows and other sales promotions 
another important part of the company s strategy is to emphasize customer service and support 
the company offers a day money back guarantee for all of its products  a one year warranty on parts and allows additional rights of return to certain of its customers 
the company estimates and accrues a liability for sales and warranty returns 
actual returns have not been significant to date 
the company also offers sales discounts to its customers based on the level of sales 
such discounts have historically not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that increasing its international sales is an important element in the overall strategy of future revenue growth

the increase also reflects the added selling  general and administrative costs of cybex europe and the newly acquired polycon companies for the fourth fiscal quarter

over of fourth quarter european sales were shipped by cybex europe 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to from during the same period

selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal this dollar increase reflects the increased level of expenditures in administration  sales  customer support  channel development  and marketing activities required to support the company s expanded sales base

management anticipates that the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense will continue to increase 
for fiscal  total costs for research and development were million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal  representing a increase 
the company anticipates that expenses  in terms of dollars spent  for research and development will continue to increase above the level in fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income increased to million of net sales in fiscal  from million of net sales in fiscal interest and other income amounted to million of net sales in fiscal  compared to million of net sales in fiscal this increase related primarily to interest income from the investment of cash reserves and the proceeds from the initial public offering completed july  realized gains on the sale of certain investments also contributed to the increase in other income

this slight increase was caused primarily by a decrease in net income due to the one time write off of million of purchased research and development expense in connection with the acquisition of the polycon companies  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable is attributed to the increase in sales 
the increase in inventory is attributed to the overall anticipated demand for new products introduced in the products mix  as well as the addition of inventory as a result of the acquisition of the polycon companies 
the company expects to continue to increase the level of turnkey manufacturing of products as they mature and designs stabilize  thereby reducing the level of inventory relative to those products that the company must maintain 
the increase in accounts payable relates directly to the increase in inventory

 reporting comprehensive income  which requires the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in an entity s financial statements  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which specifies revised guidelines for determining an entity s operating segments and the type and level of financial information to be required 
the company is required to adopt these standards in fiscal  but does not expect the impact of these pronouncements to be material 
year compliance the company is in the process of reviewing current software and hardware to assess the impact of the year issue 
initially  the company has determined that most of the company s current business process software and hardware are year compliant 
the company expects to complete its year analysis by the end of fiscal and does not believe that costs associated with bringing the company s computer systems into full compliance by the year will result in material costs to the company 
the company s products are year compliant as well and therefore  the company does not believe that they have any material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for products it has sold 
the company is also in the preliminary stages of assessing the impact of the year issue on its major vendors and suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
based on information presently available  the company does not anticipate any material impact on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows from the effect of the year issue on the company s internal systems or those of its major suppliers and customers 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse impact on the company 
contingencies the company has certain contingent liabilities resulting from litigation initiated by apex 
apex contends in a lawsuit filed in february against the company and others in the us district court in seattle  washington that the company has infringed patent no 
 although the outcome of any litigation can never be certain  the company does not believe that any of its products are covered by any valid claim of apex s patent 
it is the company s opinion that the outcome of such contingencies will not materially affect its business  operations  financial condition or cash flows
