item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction cautions about forward looking statements this form k includes forward looking statements about future financial results  future products and other events that have not yet occurred 
for example  statements like we expect  we anticipate or we believe are forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that actual results may differ materially from our expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future 
we will not necessarily update the information in this form k if any forward looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate 
details about risks affecting various aspects of our business are discussed throughout this form k 
investors should read all of these risks carefully  and should pay particular attention to risks affecting the areas identified in the first paragraph on page overview in the management discussion and analysis section of the k we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page during the fiscal year ended july   our overall revenue decreased by compared to fiscal  due primarily to the loss of revenue as a result of the disposition of our parsons subsidiary in august if for comparison purposes  parsons revenue was excluded from fiscal  then our revenue in fiscal would have been higher than in fiscal on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis  we reported a net loss of million for fiscal compared to net income of million in fiscal this comparison is unfavorably impacted by a million charge for purchased research and development associated with the acquisition of lacerte in fiscal and a million gain from the sale of intuit services corporation in fiscal after excluding one time charges such as the fiscal aol charge of million  the impact of our divested parsons subsidiary  the gain on sale of discontinued operations  restructuring charges and acquisition related charges in fiscal and  we would have experienced a improvement in net income in fiscal over fiscal this improved performance was primarily the result of lower cost of sales  and lower customer service and technical support costs 
our performance improved while we were making significant investments in our new quickbooks multi user technology and our expanding internet products  including the new online payroll service we introduced on a limited basis in september since we anticipate that all of our divisions will increasingly leverage the internet as a means of offering products  we expect to continue incurring significant research and development investments in fiscal through internal development  acquisitions and strategic partnerships 
the development and expansion of our internet commerce businesses will involve significant risks including intense competition and difficulty in developing and implementing new business models and new operational infrastructures 
see page of the business section for more information regarding these risks 
our business is highly seasonal 
sales of tax products are heavily concentrated from november through march 
sales of consumer finance and small business products are typically strongest during the year end holiday buying season  and therefore major product launches usually occur in the fall to take advantage of this customer buying pattern 
these seasonal patterns mean that revenue is usually strongest during the quarter ending january we experience lower revenues for the quarters ending april  july  and october  while operating expenses to develop and manage products and services continue during these periods 
this can result in significant operating losses  particularly in the july and october quarters 
the seasonality of our revenue patterns is likely to be exacerbated by our acquisition of lacerte 
operating results can also fluctuate for other reasons such as changes in product release dates  non recurring events such as acquisitions and dispositions  and product price cuts in quarters with relatively high fixed expenses 
acquisitions and dispositions in particular have a significant impact on the comparability of both our quarterly and yearly results 
results of operations our sale of parsons at the beginning of fiscal has impacted the comparability of our operating results for fiscal and fiscal accordingly  the following revenue  cost of goods sold and operating expense tables compare our fiscal results determined in accordance with gaap to our fiscal results  which exclude all revenues and expenses associated with our divested parsons subsidiary 
since parsons was divested for our entire fiscal year  we believe this comparison provides a more meaningful analysis of our results 
fiscal and fiscal results are being presented and compared on a gaap basis since both years include activity from our divested parsons subsidiary 
net revenue dollars in millions change change gaap gaap excluding parsons gaap software and related services of revenue supplies of revenue total since the business of selling software and related services is considerably different from our supplies business  we break them out separately for reporting purposes 
the following revenue discussion is categorized by our business divisions  which is how we examine our results internally 
our domestic supplies business is considered a part of our small business division while the international supplies business is considered part of our international division 
each of our business divisions reports internet commerce revenues that are specific to its operations and are included in its results 
we use the term internet commerce to refer to all of our internet based business activities 
internet commerce has two components internet products and electronic distribution 
internet products include activities where the customer realizes the value of the goods or services directly on the internet or an intuit server 
internet product revenues include  for example  advertising revenues generated on our quicken 
com website  online tax preparation and electronic filing revenues  and transaction and processing fees from our online insurance and online mortgage services 
electronic distribution includes revenues generated by electronic ordering and or delivery of traditional desktop software products and financial supplies 
although we have made significant progress in our internet commerce activities during the past year  investors should be aware that initial success achieved in these areas will not necessarily result in improved financial results 
we believe that the dramatic growth of the internet and the web will give us significant opportunities to grow our revenue over the next several years 
however  revenue from internet commerce was only of total revenue during fiscal for internet products and for electronic distribution 
we recognize revenue from sales of our desktop software products when products are shipped  less reserves for expected returns and rebates from both the retail and direct distribution channels 
these reserves are difficult to estimate  especially for seasonal products 
if actual returns are significantly higher than our estimated reserves  this could have a material negative impact on our revenue and operating results 
see note of the financial statement notes page for additional information regarding net revenue 
small business division 
small business division revenues come primarily from the following sources quickbooks product line supplies products including checks  envelopes and invoices tax table services support fees charged to customers for telephone assistance overall  revenue for the division grew in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the division were largely affected by the timing of our quickbooks product releases in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we launched quickbooks in the second quarter december 
in fiscal we launched our quickbooks products including the quickbooks pro multi user product in the fourth quarter june 
with the quickbooks pro multi user product  we are targeting the multi user market for the first time 
while we believe this will appeal to larger small business customers than we have been able to reach in the past  there are also risks 
the multi user version of quickbooks has a higher sale price than single user versions  which may adversely impact the channels we use to distribute the product  and may also adversely impact quickbooks upgrade sales 
customer service and technical support costs may also be higher due to the added complexity of this product 
if these or other risks occur  there could be a negative impact on our operating results 
supplies revenues grew by in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth was primarily the result of our increasing customer base of small business owners who use quickbooks and quicken to run their small businesses 
our supplies business is a more consistent source of revenue than our software business  and is derived from an existing customer base 
while customers may go long periods of time without buying a new version of software  they will often buy supplies in between software purchases 
tax table service revenues and fees charged for telephone support also grew substantially in fiscal in september  we introduced our new payroll processing service for our small business customers 
in fiscal  we incurred considerable research and development costs to develop this service 
these expenditures will continue in fiscal we expect this service to be unprofitable in its initial stages and long term profitability will depend on our ability to obtain a large number of subscribers for this service from our quickbooks user base 
if subscriptions don t meet expectations  our future operating results could be negatively impacted 
small business division revenues increased by in compared to this was largely driven by higher quickbooks product sales resulting from the release of version in december we also benefited from a favorable shift in consumer buying patterns to higher priced  increased functionality quickbooks products in fiscal compared to fiscal supplies net revenue increased by in fiscal over fiscal as the result of higher customized check  envelope and invoice orders from an increasing small business customer base 
increased tax table service revenues and an expanded fee for support program which began charging users for telephone assistance with their quickbooks products beginning in fiscal also contributed to growth 
tax division 
tax division revenues come primarily from the following sources turbotax and macintax personal tax preparation products professional tax preparation products proseries and lacerte product lines electronic tax return preparation and filing fees overall  tax division revenues grew in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth reflects higher sales of our turbotax products in fiscal and a sales mix improvement towards higher priced deluxe products 
the personal tax market was more competitive in fiscal because our primary competitor lowered its prices earlier in the tax software sales season this year 
despite intense competition  we achieved sales increases largely due to positive product reviews in the press  federal tax law changes enacted in late and an expanded investment in retail distribution 
we were also successful in getting our turbotax products to market more quickly in fiscal the tax division also experienced growth in internet commerce revenues during fiscal as evidenced by significant increases in electronic filing and state tax product downloads compared to the prior year 
we believe that competition will continue to be intense in fiscal and beyond 
it is possible that microsoft corporation will enter the personal tax preparation software market  which could have a negative impact on our revenue  profitability and market share 
we are also at risk if federal or state government agencies choose to offer tax preparation software products or electronic filing services that would compete with our products 
our professional tax product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we experienced this growth primarily because we have been successful in attaining new customers and in many cases have upgraded renewal customers to higher priced  increased functionality products 
we expect the acquisition of lacerte will significantly expand our professional tax operations during fiscal in its fiscal years ended march  and  lacerte had revenue of million and million  respectively  and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
while we expect that the acquisition will add to revenue and earnings  there are risks 
see acquisition of lacerte on page of the business section for more detail regarding strategic benefits and risks of the lacerte acquisition 
we are also assuming significant acquisition related costs as a result of the transaction 
see note of the financial statement notes page for a discussion of these costs 
both personal and professional tax products experienced revenue growth in fiscal personal tax product revenues for fiscal grew by approximately over fiscal as a result of increases in both the direct and retail channel sales of intuit s turbotax and related products 
sales increases were attributable both to higher unit sales and a favorable shift in buying patterns to higher priced products 
professional tax product revenues grew by approximately over the prior year due to strong customer acceptance of windows based product offerings and an increase in pay per return revenues 
consumer finance division 
consumer finance division revenues are derived primarily from the following sources quicken product line advertising and sponsorship fees from the consumer areas of our quicken 
com website implementation  marketing and transaction fees from financial institutions including marketspace participants providing services through quicken and quicken 
com overall  consumer finance division revenues grew in fiscal compared to fiscal our quicken product sales were up slightly for the year  reflecting a more favorable sales mix toward our higher priced products  offset by lower overall unit sales 
while we anticipate that quicken revenues will remain roughly flat for fiscal year  there is a risk that they will decline 
in fiscal  quicken experienced over a decline in revenues 
there is no assurance that similar declines will not occur in the future 
fiscal revenue included a million royalty payment from checkfree  which we will not receive in fiscal growth for the division was driven by increasing internet product revenues  which approximately doubled in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth has been generated in part by collaborating with third party online service and content providers such as excite and aol  which have helped to increase traffic to our quicken 
com website 
the excite agreement calls for us to share revenue generated from our quicken 
com site 
the aol agreement calls for us to make significant guaranteed payments over the term of the agreement 
see note page of the financial statement notes for more information regarding the excite and aol agreements 
while the internet provides a significant opportunity for revenue growth  there are also risks 
since we have made significant financial commitments to third party providers  we must continue to increase traffic and revenue in order to become profitable 
see risks of internet commerce  on page  for more information regarding risks 
consumer finance division revenues declined approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the combination of price reductions and lower retail unit sales of intuit s quicken product line were primarily responsible for the decline 
in addition  we experienced a shift in consumer buying patterns away from deluxe versions of products and toward lower priced regular product versions in fiscal in fiscal  intuit s revenues included a million fee from checkfree for connectivity to checkfree s bill payment service through quicken 
international division 
international division revenues come primarily from the following sources japanese small business products german quicken  quickbooks and tax products canadian quicken  quickbooks and tax products united kingdom quicken  quickbooks and tax products in addition to the above  we also operate in smaller european  asian and latin american markets 
international division revenues were down slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal this reflects lower revenues in europe  roughly flat revenues in japan and higher revenues in canada 
in fiscal  we launched a new version of quicken throughout europe and a new version of quickbooks in germany 
in japan  revenues were negatively impacted by the recent economic slowdown  increasing competition in the high end small business accounting market and a weak japanese currency 
this was partially offset by increased revenues resulting from our acquisition of nihon micom 
in canada  we experienced solid revenue growth from our quicktax  quicken and quickbooks products 
we have refocused our product development in europe towards small business products in selected larger markets 
as a result  we expect to devote fewer resources to consumer finance and tax products  and to smaller geographic markets 
we also introduced quickbooks in japan in september in an effort to target a lower priced market than our current products reach 
while we expect that international revenues will be flat or slightly down in fiscal year  there is a risk that they could be significantly lower if our initiatives are not effective or if the japanese currency continues to devalue significantly 
in anticipation of the upcoming conversion to a common european currency  we have performed preliminary evaluations to determine the impact on our internal systems and products 
based on these evaluations  we currently believe the conversion will have an immaterial impact on our operations 
international division revenues experienced growth of approximately during fiscal compared to fiscal this growth was the result of significant gains in the japan and european regions 
in japan  growth resulted from the release of a windows based product acquired from nihon micom 
in the european region  sales improved due to quicken product releases in germany and the release of quickbooks in the uk in canada  fiscal growth was attributable to an increase in unit sales of canadian versions of quicken  quickbooks and quicktax products 
cost of goods sold dollars in millions change change gaap gaap excluding parsons gaap product of revenue amortization of purchased software and other of revenue there are two components of cost of goods sold 
the largest is the direct cost of manufacturing and shipping products 
the second component is the amortization of purchased software  which is the cost of products obtained through business acquisitions 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  cost of goods sold decreased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal this improvement was the result of our customers buying more of our cd rom products  which cost less to manufacture and ship than disk based products 
we have also improved the efficiency of our order taking process in the financial supplies business  which has reduced costly re orders 
while we are continuing our efforts to reduce these costs  we expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue to increase in fiscal due largely to the changing nature of our business 
primary reasons are as follows our expanding service related businesses such as online payroll and support fees for telephone assistance tend to produce lower margins and will result in higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
we are increasing our investment in the infrastructure required to support our expanding internet commerce businesses 
although not significant in fiscal  these costs will be classified as cost of goods sold in fiscal some of these new cost of sales items such as depreciation of servers tend to be fixed in nature and may cause significant variations in quarterly comparisons of cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
we believe that all of these factors will continue to put upward pressure on our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in fiscal and beyond 
cost of goods sold could also be negatively impacted if we experience errors in our current or future products 
while this risk is mitigated by our increasing capability to fix product errors less expensively via the internet  our results may suffer if there is a material product error 
total cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal this was the result of improvements in supplies order processing  a reduction of obsolete inventory write offs in germany  lower materials costs  increasing sales of cd rom products and a decrease in warranty expenses in fiscal compared to operating expenses dollars in millions change change gaap gaap excluding parsons gaap customer service and technical support of revenue selling and marketing of revenue research and development of revenue general and administrative 
of revenue charge for purchased research and development of revenue other acquisition costs  including amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles of revenue restructuring costs n a of revenue customer service and technical support 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  customer service and technical support expenses decreased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal we benefited from cost reductions due to the restructuring and consolidation of our technical support facilities in the united states and europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have also benefited from our initiatives to provide customer service and technical support less expensively through websites and other electronic means 
while we anticipate that service and support expenses will stay relatively flat or decrease as a percentage of revenue because of the restructuring and increased fees charged for telephone support  there is a risk that these expenses could increase 
for example  our new multi user quickbooks product may result in higher customer service and technical support expenses since customers may need considerably more assistance with this more complex product 
customer service and technical support expenses remained constant at approximately of net revenue for both fiscal and international technical support cost increases were offset by improved management of domestic technical support facilities and resources and higher product quality in fiscal compared to selling and marketing 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the significant increase was due to a charge of million related to the aol agreement in the third quarter of fiscal  as well as increased selling and marketing costs in support of our turbotax product launch and increased promotion of our internet products 
we expect this trend to continue as competition intensifies in the personal tax market and for our internet products in fiscal selling and marketing expenses for fiscal grew to of net revenue compared to in this increase was due to higher marketing expenses in response to increased tax product competition and the support of several key international product launches 
research and development 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  research and development expenses increased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the development of the multi user version of quickbooks contributed to these increasing costs since it was more expensive to develop than our less complex single user products 
increases were also a result of our increased spending to improve and expand our internet products in an effort to attract more customer traffic to quicken 
com 
we believe that research and development expenses related to internet products will continue to increase in fiscal this could have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly if revenue from these services does not meet expectations 
research and development expenses grew to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in this increase resulted from an increased investment in internet product initiatives as well as the development of our desktop software 
specifically  expenses rose as a result of development costs related to quicken insuremarket  development work on open financial exchange a specification for the exchange of financial information over the internet and the development of other financial websites 
general and administrative 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses remained essentially flat at of net revenue for both fiscal and fiscal charge for purchased research and development 
when acquiring a company  we often record a one time charge for purchased research and development 
this charge represents the value of products we acquire that aren t yet complete enough to be considered technologically feasible 
we recorded such a charge of million in fiscal as the result of the lacerte acquisition  million in fiscal million when we acquired galt technologies  inc and million when we acquired nihon micom and million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of iis 
since these charges are specific to each particular acquisition  we are unable to estimate what these charges may be in the future 
the fiscal charge for purchased in process research and development resulted from our acquisition of lacerte 
the amount of this write off was determined by valuing the projects under development for which technological feasibility had not been established 
two projects were identified for products being developed under separate operating systems dos and windows 
the value of the products was determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process technology into commercially feasible products  estimating the net cash flows we believe will result from the products and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value 
we believe these products will be completed by march and that the risk of these products not being successfully completed is low 
however  if we were unable to successfully develop these products  it could have a negative impact on our operating results 
other acquisition costs 
other acquisition costs include the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles that are recorded as part of an acquisition 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  these costs increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to our acquisition of lacerte 
acquisition costs decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to this decrease was due to the fact that a majority of the intangibles related to our december acquisition of chipsoft inc became fully amortized during fiscal for future periods  acquisition costs will continue to have an impact on our results 
based on acquisitions completed as of july   future amortization will reduce net income after tax by approximately million  million and million for the years ending july  through  respectively 
if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  this could result in additional amortization charges 
specifically  if we exercise our option to purchase venture finance software corp 
see note page of the financial statement notes  we would record substantial intangible assets that would be amortized over the life of vfsc s technology 
restructuring costs 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in our fourth quarter of fiscal to account for the consolidation of technical support sales and other operations in the us and europe 
as part of the restructuring  we closed our rio rancho  new mexico customer support facility 
as of july  we have a balance of approximately million in accrued restructuring related expenses 
other income for fiscal  interest and other income and expense  net  remained essentially flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the same periods of the prior year 
the million gain on disposal of business in fiscal resulted from the sale of our parsons subsidiary in august income taxes for fiscal we recorded a tax benefit of million and pretax loss of million  resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of 
the effective tax rates in prior years were significantly higher due to charges for in process research and development and amortization of certain intangibles related to various acquisitions for which no tax benefit is available 
as of july   we have provided a valuation reserve of million related to the benefit of losses in our foreign subsidiaries that we believe are unlikely to be realized 
discontinued operations we sold our isc subsidiary to checkfree corporation in the second quarter of fiscal this resulted in a million gain  net of tax 
see note of the financial statement notes for additional information regarding this sale and the on going treatment of our investment in checkfree 
liquidity and capital resources at july   our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a million increase from july  improvements in liquidity were a result of net cash provided by operations and financing activities  partially offset by cash used for investing activities 
our operations provided million in cash during the twelve months ended july  primary contributors to cash provided were net income adjusted for non cash expenses such as acquisition charges and depreciation as well as a significant increase in accrued liabilities 
the increase in liabilities was driven by higher reserves for rebates and returns resulting from product releases occurring during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year 
in the prior fiscal year  product releases occurred during our first and second fiscal quarters  which generally resulted in lower reserves at year end 
these increases were partially offset by cash used for payments we made for expenses related to the isc and parsons sales  a reduction in prepaid assets and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities 
we also experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable balances due to the fourth quarter product releases 
investing activities used million in cash for the twelve months ended july  the primary use of cash was our acquisition of lacerte  a professional tax preparation software company  for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition was funded by a public offering of million shares of common stock  discussed below 
other uses of cash included net purchases of both short term and long term investments  in addition to purchases of property and equipment 
capital expenditures are primarily for equipment and facilities to support our ongoing and expanding operations and information systems 
uses of cash were partially offset by million in cash proceeds from the sale of our parsons subsidiary and million from the sale of our technical support facility in new mexico 
due to our significant investments in marketable securities  there is a risk that market value declines may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
for example  we experienced a significant decline in the value of our investment in checkfree subsequent to our fiscal year end 
there can be no assurance that similar declines will not occur for any of our marketable securities 
if such declines are deemed to be permanent  they will result in a charge to our statement of operations 
see note page of the financial statement notes for more information about recent declines in marketable securities 
the million in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to our public offering of million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal net proceeds were approximately million 
in march  we borrowed million from japanese banks in connection with our acquisition of nihon micom 
we have guaranteed the loan and pledged approximately million of short term investments of the current loan balance to be restricted as security for the borrowings at july  our agreement with aol obligates us to pay a minimum of million over the term of the three year agreement 
of this amount  approximately million was paid to aol in the third quarter of fiscal we currently do not have any other significant capital expenditure commitments  though we may require additional cash for strategic projects in the future 
for example  if we exercise our option to purchase vfsc see note of the financial statement notes and elect to pay all or a significant portion of the exercise price in cash  it would require a significant cash expenditure 
in the normal course of business  we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and international locations 
see note of the financial statement notes page and the properties section page for more information on lease commitments 
we believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year many existing computer systems use only the last two digits to identify a year 
consequently  as the year approaches  many systems do not yet recognize the difference in a year that begins with instead of this  as well as other date related processing issues  may cause systems to fail or malfunction unless corrected 
we are currently taking steps to address year issues in the following three areas our internal systems including information technology such as financial and order entry systems and non information technology systems such as phones and facilities  our products  and the readiness of third parties with whom we have business relationships 
we have assigned a dedicated year project team to develop and implement a comprehensive five phase year readiness plan for our world wide operations relating to all of these areas 
this plan has executive sponsorship  is regularly reviewed by senior management and includes progress reports to the board of directors on a regular basis 
phase one initiation involves increasing company awareness by educating and involving all appropriate levels of management regarding the need to address year issues 
phase two inventory consists of identifying all of our systems  products and relationships that may be impacted by year phase three assessment involves determining our current state of year readiness for those areas identified in the inventory phase and prioritizing areas that need to be fixed 
phase four action will consist of developing a plan for those areas identified as needing correction in the assessment phase 
phase five implementation will consist of executing our action plan and completing the steps identified to attain year readiness 
we are currently in the inventory phase of the plan for both our internal systems and third party relationships 
for our products  we are in either the inventory or assessment phase of our plan 
we currently expect to complete implementation for all of the targeted areas by the end of our fiscal year july 
while year costs incurred to date including litigation costs have not been material  we will incur additional costs as we complete the project phases 
based on preliminary assessments resulting from the early phases of our plan in each of the targeted areas  we are currently unable to determine whether additional costs to achieve year readiness will be material 
additional costs incurred may include but are not limited to the cost of manufacturing and distributing free solutions for products that are not year ready  the impact of lost sales due to distribution of free year ready solutions for affected products  the administrative costs of completing the year project  the cost of correcting our internal systems  and the cost of implementing necessary contingency plans 
while we are dedicating substantial resources toward attaining year readiness  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to address all year issues 
if we are not successful  there could be significant adverse effects on our operations 
for example  failure to achieve year readiness for our internal systems could delay our ability to manufacture and ship products  disrupt our customer service and technical support facilities  or interrupt customer access to our online products and services 
if our products are not year ready  we could suffer lost sales or other negative consequences resulting from customer dissatisfaction  including additional litigation see discussion below 
we also rely heavily on third parties such as manufacturing suppliers  service providers  financial institutions and a large retail distribution channel 
if these or other third parties experience year failures or malfunctions  there could be a material negative impact on our ability to conduct ongoing operations 
for example  our ability to manufacture and ship products into the retail channel  to receive retail sales information necessary to maintain proper inventory levels  or to complete online transactions dependent upon third party service providers  could be affected 
many of our products are significantly interconnected with heavily regulated financial institutions 
our relationships with financial institutions could be impacted if we do not achieve year readiness in a manner and on a time schedule that permits them to comply with regulatory requirements 
we may also incur additional costs if we are required to accelerate our year readiness to meet financial institution requirements 
as with all companies  we also rely on other more widely used entities such as government agencies  public utilities and other external forces common to business and industry 
consequently  if such entities were to experience year failures  this could disrupt our ability to conduct ongoing operations 
in an effort to reduce the risks associated with the year  we have incorporated contingency planning as part of our five phase plan  building upon disaster recovery and contingency planning that we already have in place 
this includes identifying areas where we are most vulnerable to year risk and putting contingency plans in place before we experience potential failures 
for example  we have contracted with multiple suppliers to better ensure that our products can be manufactured if a particular supplier experiences system failures 
we are building a second data center facility that will give us an opportunity to develop back up systems 
we have also contracted with multiple transportation companies to provide product delivery alternatives 
while we believe these contingency plans will reduce certain risks  we are still assessing the need for additional contingency plans in areas where we believe there may be significant exposure 
several class action lawsuits have recently been filed against intuit in california and new york  alleging year issues with the online banking functionality in certain versions of our quicken products  and it is possible that we will face additional lawsuits 
we do not believe the lawsuits have merit and intend to defend them vigorously 
we have been working with financial institutions to provide solutions to their current online banking customers and are planning to make such solutions available before customers experience any year problems 
see part i  item  legal proceedings page for more information 
the above discussion regarding costs  risks and estimated completion dates for the year is based on our best estimates given information that is currently available  and is subject to change 
as we continue to progress with this initiative  we may discover that actual results will differ materially from these estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments that meet high quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy dictates that we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments to a maximum of million to any one issuer 
our policy also dictates that all short term investments mature in months or less 
the following table provides expected maturity and interest rate information for our investment portfolio 
maturity information is based on principal cash flows and interest rates are calculated on a weighted average basis 
principal amounts by expected maturity in thousands  except interest rates years ending july  fair value july  total cash equivalents    average interest rate investments     average interest rate total portfolio     average interest rate marketable securities we also carry significant balances in marketable equity securities as of july  these securities are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
see note of the financial statement notes for more information regarding risks related to our investments in marketable securities 
impact of foreign currency rate changes during fiscal year  most local currencies of our international subsidiaries weakened against the us dollar 
since we translate foreign currencies into u 
s dollars for reporting purposes  these weakened currencies had a negative  though immaterial  impact on our results 
we also believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiaries invoice customers  and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
there was also an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal year currency exchange risk is also minimized since foreign debt is due almost exclusively in local foreign currencies 
during fiscal  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
