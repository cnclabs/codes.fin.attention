item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s primary business is the manufacture and marketing of high quality polyester products  including fortrel r brand polyester textile fibers  polyester fibers made from recycled raw materials and permaclear r brand pet polyethylene terephthalate packaging resins 
the company currently has annual capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of fiber and million pounds of resins worldwide at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
the company is also the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in its manufacturing operations 
the company plans to substantially increase its polyester fiber and pet resins production capacity through the construction of its new  state of the art pearl river plant in mississippi 
this facility commences operation in three phases beginning in late by the year  this facility is expected to have annual capacity to manufacture million pounds of resins and million pounds of fiber 
as a result  the company s production mix is expected to be approximately fibers and pet resins 
the fibers group produces fortrel r textile fibers  which currently represent approximately of the company s fiber production 
these fibers are used in apparel and home furnishings and are produced from two chemical raw materials  purified terephthalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg 
the other of fiber production  primarily fiberfill and carpet fibers  is manufactured by the recycled products group from recycled raw materials  including postindustrial fiber  resin and film materials and postconsumer pet soft drink bottles 
the company s pet resins  produced by the packaging products group from pta and meg  are primarily used in the manufacture of clear plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the company s markets are highly competitive 
it competes in these markets primarily on the basis of product quality  customer service  brand identity and price 
it believes it is the second largest polyester staple and third largest poy producer in the united states and the fourth largest pet resins producer in north america 
several of the company s competitors are substantially larger than the company and have substantially greater economic resources 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical  as it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports  all of which are driven primarily by general economic conditions 
global pet resins demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversion from other packaging materials to pet 
several factors significantly affect the company s profitability raw material margins  which are the difference or spread between product selling prices and raw material costs  supply and demand for its products  the prices of competing materials  such as cotton and aluminum  which can affect demand for its products  and economic and market conditions in the united states  europe and other regions of the world 
prices of pta and meg  primary determinants of polyester fiber and pet resins selling prices  are cyclical 
changes in pta and meg prices are driven by worldwide supply and demand 
raw material margins for the chemical based fiber and pet resins businesses have generally been influenced by supply and demand factors 
despite growing demand for pet resins  worldwide supply has recently undergone significant expansion which has adversely affected profitability 
both fiber and resins margins experience increases or decreases due to timing of price changes and market conditions 
raw material margins for the recycled fiber operation tend to be more variable than those for the chemical based businesses  primarily because changes in recycled raw material costs do not cause changes in fiber prices 
recycled raw material costs are primarily dependent upon worldwide supply and demand for waste materials 
the company s sales are neither materially dependent upon a single customer nor seasonal in nature 
sales for pet resins  primarily for soft drink bottles and other beverages  may be influenced by weather and the relative price of aluminum cans 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fiber and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions  supply and demand balances  the prices of competing materials  such as cotton  and export activity 
results of operations compared to net sales for remained unchanged as compared to at billion primarily as a result of higher sales volumes offsetting lower selling prices 
sales for the fibers group decreased to million in from million in due to significantly lower polyester fiber selling prices which more than offset slightly higher sales volumes 
sales for the recycled products group rpg increased to million in from million in due to increased polyester fiber sales volumes and higher sales in other divisions which offset worldwide declines in polyester fiber selling prices 
sales volumes in were negatively impacted by a week strike at the company s irish fiber operation  which kept the facility closed from mid july through early october 
despite substantially higher domestic sales volumes  sales for the packaging products group ppg increased only slightly to million in from in as a result of significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices 
in the second quarter of  the company commenced operation of an additional million pounds per year pet resins production line at its darlington  sc plant 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the gross profit margin for was compared to for this was primarily the result of increased profitability in the rpg which offset lower profitability in the fibers group and ppg 
the company s gross profit in was negatively impacted by a charge of million to establish an inventory reserve resulting from large declines in raw material costs and a week strike at the company s irish fiber operation 
gross profit for the fibers group decreased primarily as a result of significantly lower polyester fiber selling prices offsetting lower overall costs 
gross profit for the rpg increased significantly in due in part to increased sales volumes at the company s irish fiber operation as a result of the period being negatively impacted by the aforementioned strike 
in addition  the increase is attributable to substantially lower worldwide raw material costs and higher domestic sales volumes for fiber  and increased gross profit in other divisions 
despite higher domestic sales volumes resulting from the aforementioned capacity expansion and lower raw material costs  gross profit for the ppg decreased significantly in principally due to significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales 
the decrease is due to reduced costs at the company s european operations resulting from the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of see below as well as the company s continued efforts to reduce overall spending 
during the second quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and enhance the competitive position of its european operations  resulting in a pretax charge of approximately million 
the primary components of the restructuring charge relate to the modification of certain supply and service agreements at the company s netherlands based pet resins business and termination benefits related to a workforce reduction at the company s irish fiber operation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income was million in  or million excluding the restructuring charge  compared to million in net interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense was due principally to higher interest capitalization resulting from the company s ongoing capacity expansion program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pretax loss of million which decreased net earnings by million  or per diluted share 
the loss is comprised of two parts a loss on the sale of a subsidiary and a gain from an insurance reimbursement related to a warehouse fire at the company s irish fiber operation in july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective income tax rate was in compared to in the rate decreased primarily as a result of increased earnings at the company s irish fiber operation  which is subject to significantly lower tax rates than the us operations  and the reduction in foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit had been provided 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings for were million  or per diluted share 
excluding the one time charges  net earnings for were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in outlook demand for the company s polyester fibers is expected to remain healthy in however  domestic fiber profit margins remain at historically low levels primarily due to continued downward pressure on selling prices  which may continue in domestic pet resins sales volumes are expected to increase in primarily due to the completion of a domestic expansion in the second quarter of and the scheduled start up of the first pet resins production line at the company s pearl river plant in late the company believes that profit margins in this business will continue to recover in over the historically low levels in operating profit in is expected to benefit from a restructuring plan the company implemented at its european operations in the second quarter of through which it modified a pet resins take or pay supply agreement at the netherlands facility and reduced staffing at the irish fiber operation 
to date  the company has experienced little effect from the financial troubles of the far east which began in however  the company is uncertain what effect the present situation will have on future operations 
results of operations compared to net sales for remained unchanged as compared to at billion 
this was generally the result of increased sales volumes and lower selling prices 
sales for the fibers group decreased to million in from million in due to significantly lower polyester fiber selling prices which more than offset improved fiber sales volumes during the latter part of sales for the rpg decreased to million from million due primarily to a week strike at the company s irish fiber operation  which kept the facility closed from mid july through early october  and the disposition of certain businesses which had sales in of million 
in addition  the decline in rpg s sales was a result of lower polyester fiber selling prices for the domestic and irish fiber operations 
sales for the ppg increased to million in from million in due to higher sales volumes resulting from the december  acquisition of a netherlands based pet resins business and the mid expansion of domestic pet resins capacity 
this increased volume more than offset significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in the gross profit margin for was compared to for gross profit for the fibers group decreased primarily as a result of significantly lower fiber selling prices due to weak textile demand in the first half of the year which more than offset lower chemical raw material costs 
gross profit for the rpg also decreased in from primarily due to reduced profit at the company s irish fiber operation stemming from weak business conditions compounded by the strike  and the discontinuance of gross profit from divested businesses 
this more than offset increased profits for the domestic recycled fiber business as a result of lower raw material costs 
despite higher sales volumes resulting from the aforementioned acquisition of the netherlands based pet resins business and domestic pet resins expansion  the gross profit for the ppg decreased in due to significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices  which more than offset lower raw material costs 
these factors contributed to a loss at the netherlands based pet resins operation 
the company s gross profit for was also negatively impacted by a million inventory charge resulting from large declines in raw material costs and selling prices  including a million charge related to the pet resins take or pay arrangement 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income decreased to million in compared to million in net interest expense for increased to million from million for interest expense increased as a result of higher average outstanding borrowings which were partially offset by higher interest capitalization resulting from the company s long term capital investment program 
the effective income tax rate was in compared to in this resulted from lower pretax earnings  lower earnings at the irish manufacturing operations which benefit from a favorable tax rate  and a pretax loss at the european pet resins operation which has no tax benefit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings for were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in environmental matters the company s operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
the company takes a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to its manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
the company has identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations as well as to support planned future expansion 
the majority of the identified situations are found at the company s largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
the company s policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company currently estimates its future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  the company has accrued management s best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
the company believes that it is entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during  and  costs associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the measurement of liability is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information which becomes available 
the company believes it is either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or is operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

year the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify certain portions of its software and process equipment so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company expects to complete its year project by mid  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the total project cost  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
see forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash from operations of million in compared to million in net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to million in capital spending amounted to million in and million in  reflecting the company s ongoing capital investment program 
proceeds from divestitures and other amounted to million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in compared to net cash used of million in net borrowings were million in compared to million in in  the company completed the repurchase of million shares of its common stock in the open market at a cost of million 
with the completion of the pet resins capacity expansion at the darlington  sc plant in the second quarter of  the remainder of the company s ongoing capital investment program consists primarily of the construction of its pearl river plant in mississippi 
the total capitalized cost of the facility is estimated to be approximately million  consisting of approximately million of construction costs plus mississippi state grants and capitalized interest 
this facility  approximately completed  is expected to be operational in three phases beginning in late the company s planned capital expenditures in are estimated to range between and million  with aggregate capital expenditures through the end of estimated at approximately million 
the exact amount and timing of the capital spending is difficult to predict since certain projects may extend into or beyond depending upon equipment delivery and construction schedules 
to receive certain incentives provided by the state of mississippi  the company  in conjunction with the mississippi business finance corporation  expects to issue a series of taxable rural economic development bonds 
the company s financing agreements contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
the most restrictive of these covenants permits a maximum leverage ratio of  requires ebitda to exceed times interest expense and requires the company to maintain a certain net worth 
the financial resources available to the company at december  include million under its million revolving credit facility  unused short term uncommitted lines of credit aggregating approximately million  and internally generated funds 
the company is pursuing other forms of financing including the issuance of public or private debt securities 
the company believes these financial resources and other credit arrangements will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable working capital  capital expenditure and dividend payment requirements 
the company has entered into two types of financial instruments to minimize its interest rate exposure 
one instrument  with a notional amount of million  was designed to provide a fixed year interest rate of exclusive of corporate spreads on million of debt if issued on december  and approximately exclusive of corporate spreads if issued on march  the company has also entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on variable rate borrowings  thereby eliminating substantial interest rate risk 
the agreements are for million  million of which were in effect at december   and million with starting dates ranging between february and may maturity dates are a minimum of years and a maximum of years after the starting date of the swaps 
the swaps will effectively fix the rate of interest between and on million of borrowings 
in aggregate  the company estimates it would have had to pay approximately million to terminate these agreements at december  the company has entered into forward foreign currency contracts to exchange dutch guilders for us dollars with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  in order to reduce the related impact of foreign currency translation adjustments 
this has the effect of converting a portion of us debt to local currency guilder debt 
the company has designated these contracts as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity 
at december   the company estimates it would receive approximately million  if these contracts were terminated 
the company has also entered into forward foreign currency contracts to exchange us dollars for german marks with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  these contracts are designed to reduce hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations relative to fixed asset purchase commitments and have maturity dates ranging from january through march at december   the company would have had to pay approximately million to terminate these contracts 
the company s european businesses utilize foreign currency debt and forward currency contracts to hedge certain of their accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in other foreign currencies 
at december   the notional amount of the forward foreign currency contracts was million and the cost to terminate these contracts was not significant 
the company s estimates with respect to the values of its derivative instruments are based on readily available dealer quotes 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information fas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fas requires that a public company report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments pursuant to criteria that differ from current accounting practice 
operating segments  as defined  are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the financial information to be reported includes segment profit or loss  certain revenue and expense items and segment assets and reconciliations to corresponding amounts in the general purpose financial statements 
fas also requires information about products and services  geographic areas of operation  and major customers 
the company has not completed its analysis of the effect of adoption of fas on its financial statement disclosure  however  the adoption of fas will not affect results of operations or financial position

results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which the company is subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties which may be more significant to the company 
impact of economic conditions capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply  is a critical factor affecting the company s financial performance 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical because it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports  all of which are driven primarily by general economic conditions 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fiber and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions 
supply is expanding for both fiber and resins in the united states 
while expectations are that growth in demand will approximate growth in supply  any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce profitability 
a material change in demand  supply or in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
impact of far eastern financial crisis in the fourth quarter of  the far eastern economies  which are the largest and were  until recently  the fastest growing polyester market  experienced a significant economic and financial crisis 
this crisis is expected to affect the size of the market and future expansions 
given the inherent uncertainties surrounding the far eastern polyester markets  it is unknown what effect the crisis will have on the us polyester fiber and resins markets 
however  given the size of the far eastern markets  the impact could be significant and this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependency on availability of raw materials the company s operations are substantially dependent on the availability of its two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
the company currently relies on a single source for the supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any of such sources  of a disruption in their business or failure to meet the company s product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that precautions taken by the company would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
construction program the company is currently constructing a new pet resins and polyester fiber production facility in mississippi at a total estimated capitalized cost of approximately million 
the facility  which is expected to commence operations in three phases beginning in late  will have an initial annual capacity of approximately million pounds of pet packaging resins and million pounds of polyester fiber 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to commence operations as scheduled  that it will not encounter significant disruptions in its operations  that the facility will operate as effectively as expected  or that the company will be able to sell at acceptable prices the added volumes from this facility 
environmental matters actual costs to be incurred for identified environmental situations in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies 
year in addition to the company s procedures relating to the year see year above  the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the costs of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
