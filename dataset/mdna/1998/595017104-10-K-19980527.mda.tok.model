item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative special charges operating income net sales microchip s net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal and net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal the company s family of bit microcontrollers represents the largest component of microchip s total net sales 
microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
a related component of the company s product sales consists primarily of serial eeprom memories which accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s net sales in any given quarter are dependent upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter turns orders and shipments from backlog 
the company has emphasized its ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of its competitive strategy 
this strategy  combined with current industry conditions  results in customers placing orders with short delivery schedules 
the company experienced increasing turns orders as a portion of the company s business in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which reduced the company s visibility in projecting net sales levels 
because turns orders are difficult to predict  there can be no assurance that the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in any quarter will be sufficient to achieve growth in net sales 
if the company does not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter  the company s revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
the company s overall average selling prices for its microcontroller products have remained relatively constant  while average selling prices of its memory products have declined over time 
during fiscal  the company continued to experience increased pricing pressure on its memory products primarily due to the less proprietary nature of these products and increased competition  and expects this to continue in the future 
while average selling prices for microcontrollers have remained relatively constant  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  increasing pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines  due primarily to competitive conditions 
the company has been able to maintain average selling prices by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices  thereby offsetting price declines in older products 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices for the company s microcontroller or other products can be maintained due to increased pricing pressure in the future 
an increase in pricing pressure could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the foregoing statements regarding turns orders  average selling prices and pricing pressures are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  inventory  mix and timing of customer orders  competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability  customers inventory levels  order patterns and seasonality  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  market acceptance of the products of both the company and its customers  demand for the company s products  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in product mix  and absorption of fixed costs  labor and other fixed manufacturing costs 
several asian countries have recently experienced economic difficulties including high rates of loan defaults  business failures and currency devaluations 
during the quarters ended december  and march   the company experienced weakness in the expected level of turns orders and net sales related to its business in asia 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal  shipments to asia were lower than the preceding quarter by approximately 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net sales from customers in asia and there can be no assurance that such economic difficulties will not continue to adversely affect the company s operating results in future periods 
foreign sales represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s foreign sales have been predominantly in asia and europe which the company attributes to the manufacturing strength in those areas for consumer  automotive  office automation  communications and industrial products 
the majority of foreign sales are us dollar denominated 
the company has entered into and  from time to time  will enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
although none of the countries in which the company conducts significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years  there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where the company conducts operations will not adversely affect the company s operating results in the future 
additional factors affecting operating results the company believes that future growth in net sales of its bit family of microcontroller products and related memory products will depend largely upon the company s success in having its current and new products designed into high volume customer applications 
design wins typically precede the company s volume shipment of products for such applications by months or more 
the company also believes that shipment levels of its proprietary application development systems are an indicator of potential future design wins and microcontroller sales 
the company continued to achieve a high volume of design wins and shipped increased numbers of application development systems in fiscal compared to previous fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that any particular development system shipment will result in a product design win or that any particular design win will result in future product sales 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of other factors that could adversely impact its net sales and profitability  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include the company s ability to design and introduce new products on a timely basis  market acceptance of products of both the company and its customers  customer order patterns and seasonality  changes in product mix  whether the company s customers buy from a distributor or directly from the company  product performance and reliability  product obsolescence  the amount of any product returns  availability and utilization of manufacturing capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yield  the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment and other supplies  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  technological changes  competition and competitive pressures on prices  and economic  political or other conditions in the united states  and other worldwide markets served by the company 
the company believes its ability to continue to increase its manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and maintain satisfactory delivery schedules will be an important competitive factor 
as a result of the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to expanding its manufacturing capacity  the company s operating results may be adversely affected if net sales do not increase sufficiently to offset the increased costs 
the company s products are incorporated into a wide variety of consumer  automotive  office automation  communications and industrial products 
a slowdown in demand for products which utilize the company s products as a result of economic or other conditions in the worldwide markets served by the company could adversely affect the company s operating results 
gross profit the company s gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of sales was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal years and was down from the fiscal level  primarily as a result of reduced inch wafer production at one of the company s wafer fabrication facilities and increased pricing pressure on its non volatile memory products 
the company is continuing the process of transitioning products to smaller geometries and to larger wafer sizes to reduce future manufacturing costs 
eight inch wafer production commenced at the tempe wafer fabrication facility in early fiscal and the company is continuing the transitioning of products to its micron process 
the company expects that of its products will come from inch wafers during fiscal the company anticipates that its cost of sales and gross product margins will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by the product mix of bit microcontroller products and related memory products  manufacturing yields  wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions 
the foregoing statements relating to anticipated gross margins  cost of sales  inch wafer production  and the transition to higher yielding manufacturing processes are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  cost and availability of raw materials  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other direct manufacturing costs  the timing and success of manufacturing process transition  changes in product mix  competitive pressures on prices  and other economic conditions 
in the quarter ended june   the company changed its method of accounting for inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
the change did not have a material effect on the results of operations 
the fifo method is the predominant accounting method used in the semiconductor industry 
prior to this change  the company s inventory costs did not differ significantly under the two methods 
prior period results of operations have not been restated for this change as the impact is not material 
all of microchip s assembly operations are performed by third party contractors in order to meet product shipment requirements 
reliance on third parties involves some reduction in the company s level of control over these portions of its business 
while the company reviews the quality  delivery and cost performance of these third party contractors  there can be no assurance that reliance on third party contractors will not adversely impact results in future reporting periods if any third party contractor is unable to maintain assembly yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
the company s reliance on facilities in taiwan  thailand  the philippines and other foreign countries  and maintenance of substantially all of its finished goods in inventory overseas  entails certain political and economic risks  including political instability and expropriation  supply disruption  currency controls and exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in tax laws  tariff and freight rates 
microchip currently employs the alphatec electronics public company limited group of companies alphatec headquartered in bangkok  thailand for a significant portion of its product assembly volume 
while alphatec s assembly operations have performed reliably for the company for several years  alphatec has experienced financing issues in connection with some of its joint ventures involving semiconductor fabrication facilities in thailand 
such financing difficulties have not impacted alphatec s assembly facilities nor its provision of services to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that assembly operations will not be affected in the future 
microchip currently has second sources for product assembly for most of its package types and can shift additional wafer output to other factories  if necessary 
however  there can be no assurance that such action would not result in short term disruption including possible temporary product shortages 
the company has not experienced any significant interruptions in its foreign business operations to date 
nonetheless  the company s business and operating results could be adversely affected if foreign operations or international air transportation were disrupted 
research and development the company is committed to continued investment in new and enhanced products  including its development systems software and in its design and manufacturing process technology  which are significant factors in maintaining the company s competitive position 
the dollar investment in research and development increased in fiscal over fiscal  and in fiscal over fiscal the company will continue to invest in research and development in the future  including an investment in process and product development associated with the capacity expansion of the company s fabrication facilities 
the company s future operating results will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis which can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
the success of new product introductions depends on various factors  including proper new product selection  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and market acceptance of customers end products 
because of the complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new products will receive or maintain substantial market acceptance 
if the company were unable to design  develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis  its future operating results would be adversely affected 
the company s future success will also depend upon its ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies 
semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in effecting transitions to smaller geometry processes and to larger wafers and  consequently  have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries 
the company believes that its transition to smaller geometries and to larger wafers will be important for the company to remain competitive  and operating results could be adversely affected if the transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
selling  general and administrative the company increased its level of investment in selling  general and administrative costs to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increased costs reflect the requirement to invest in incremental worldwide sales and technical support resources to promote the company s embedded control products 
other income expense interest income in fiscal increased over fiscal and as a result of increased invested cash balances  resulting from completion of an equity offering in february  interest expense in fiscal decreased over fiscal and due to reductions in borrowing levels associated with the company s capital equipment additions 
other income represents numerous immaterial non operating items 
the company s interest expense could increase in fiscal if the company increases its borrowings and interest expense would be adversely impacted by increased interest rates 
provision for income taxes provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings 
the company had an effective tax rate of  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  due primarily to lower tax rates at its foreign locations 
the company believes that its tax rate for the foreseeable future will be approximately 
the foregoing statement regarding the company s anticipated future tax rate is a forward looking statement within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and is subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others current tax laws and regulations  taxation rates in geographic regions where the company has significant operations  and current tax holidays available in foreign locations 
year conversion the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the year  thus rendering them incapable of properly managing and manipulating data that includes st century dates 
the company is currently installing business and financial systems to replace existing software systems to address the year compliance issue 
the company is also currently reviewing other aspects of its computer systems  including manufacturing and product development areas 
microchip s products  for the most part  involve hardware integrated circuit devices manufactured by microchip which  subsequent to their sale  are combined with proprietary application firmware by microchip s customers 
thus  microchip believes that its products have no inherent date sensitive features 
at this time management is not able to assess the cost of year compliance 
the company does not anticipate that the year will pose significant operating problems 
however  delays in the implementation of new information systems  or a failure to fully identify and resolve all year deficiencies in the company s systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at march   a decrease of million from the march  balance 
the company has an unsecured line of credit with a syndicate of domestic banks totaling million 
borrowings under the domestic line of credit as of march  were million 
the domestic line of credit requires the company to achieve certain financial ratios and operating results 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at march  the company also has an unsecured short term line of credit totaling million with certain foreign banks 
borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march  were million 
there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 
at march   an aggregate of million of these facilities was available  subject to financial covenants and ratios with which the company was in compliance 
the company s ability to fully utilize these facilities is dependent on the company remaining in compliance with such covenants and ratios 
during the year ended march   the company generated million of cash from operating activities  an improvement of million from the year ended march  and an improvement of million from the year ended march  the improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily due to increased profitability  the impact of changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accounts receivable and an increase in depreciation expense 
the company s level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions 
capital expenditures in the years ended march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment in each of these periods 
the company currently intends to spend approximately million during the next months for additional capital equipment to increase capacity at its existing wafer fabrication facilities and to expand product test operations 
the company expects capital expenditures will be financed by cash flow from operations  available debt arrangements and other sources of financing 
the company believes that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next months will provide sufficient additional manufacturing capacity to meet its currently anticipated needs 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended march  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended march  and respectively 
proceeds from sale of stock and put options were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
proceeds from issuance of long term debt were million for the year ended march  payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
proceeds from lines of credit were million and million for the years ended march  and respectively 
repayments on lines of credit were million for the year ended march  cash expended for the purchase of the company s common stock was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
on january  and july   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares and  shares  respectively  in connection with a common stock repurchase plan 
on july   the board of directors also authorized the company to sell up to  put options in connection with the same plan 
as of march  the company has purchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of  and has outstanding  put options at prices ranging from to 
subsequent to march  the company purchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate price of  and sold put options of  shares of common stock at a price of 
subsequent to march   the company completed two transactions in connection with the stock repurchase program 
april  the company completed a costless collar transaction for  calls priced at and  puts priced at 
the expiration date of the transaction is april  also in connection with the stock repurchase program  the company completed a net share settled forward contract for  shares at an average price of 
the expiration date of this transaction is may  with quarterly interim settlement dates as determined by the company 
also subsequent to march  the company s board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase of common stock of  shares and to sell up to  additional put options 
the company expects from time to time to purchase shares of common stock in connection with its authorized common stock repurchase plan 
the company believes that its existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment  for both production and research and development 
the company may seek additional equity or debt financing during the next months for the capital expenditures required to maintain or expand the company s wafer fabrication and product test facilities or other purposes 
the timing and amount of any such capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  product mix  changes in industry conditions and competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing investors
