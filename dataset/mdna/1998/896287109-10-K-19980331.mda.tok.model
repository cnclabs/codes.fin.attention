the company expects to open additional on site property management offices in geographic areas where it presently has or expects to have significant holdings 
other revenues which include interest income  advisory fees and structuring fees decreased by to  for the year ended december  contributing to the decrease was approximately  of revenues recognized in such revenues were comprised of a fee from the sale of the retail stores leased to rex stores corporation and a settlement structuring fee from the settlement with macfrugal s 
this decreased revenue was offset by recognition of approximately  of income from the company s advisory services provided in connection with certain build to suit acquisitions 
property operating and general and administrative costs property operating costs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of the increase is attributable to the continued growth in the company s portfolio resulting in higher operating costs and compares favorably to the increase in rent revenue 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is attributable to increased personnel and related overhead as a result of the company s growth

through december   borrowings under the bid option were at a weighted average spread over libor of basis points  a basis point reduction from the contractual interest rate of basis points over libor 
during  libor ranged from to 
the overall decrease was offset in part by the higher average interest rates payable on the company s long term fixed rate debt compared to the variable rate debt replaced 
while the company intends to continue to lower its cost of debt  such a result is dependent upon factors which are beyond the company s control  and as such  there can be no assurance that this result will be achieved 
the decrease in the amortization of financing costs from to resulted from both the october amendment of the acquisition facility  which extended the maturity and therefore increased the amortization period of the loan costs  and the partial repayment on the mortgage loan during  which resulted in the write off of a portion of the deferred loan costs 
these savings were countered by additional amortization of financing costs relating to the notes and the notes issued in may  and the notes issued in july other income expense items depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   increased million  or  over that of as a result of the company s larger asset base

funds from operations the definition of funds from operations ffo was clarified in the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit white paper  adopted by the nareit board of governors on march   as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization in each case only real estate related assets  less preferred stock dividends  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company s ffo is not comparable to ffo reported by other real estate investment trusts reits that do not define ffo using the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  or cash flows from operating activity determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the table below presents the calculations for ffo on a quarterly basis for the years ended december    and for the three months ended december september june march total in thousands funds from operations income before gain and extraordinary items      real estate depreciation      joint venture income joint venture ffo  preferred dividend requirement      common dividends declared      funds from operations income before gain and extraordinary items      real estate depreciation      joint venture income joint venture ffo provision for portfolio repositioning   preferred dividend requirement    common dividends declared      funds from operations income before extraordinary charge      real estate depreciation      common dividends declared      the company s ffo payout ratio  which is expressed as annual dividends paid per share divided by annual ffo per share  has decreased over the past three years from in  to in  to in by continuing to lower the payout ratio  the company is able to retain more ffo ffo retained  which is the least expensive form of equity capital for new investments 
ffo retained  which is ffo less dividends declared  has increased from million  to million  to million for the same three years ending december  inflation the structure of the majority of the company s leases generally reduces the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
the company s leases generally provide for rent adjustments during their initial lease terms and during any option periods 
because net leases require tenants to pay for some or all operating expenses  property taxes  property repair and maintenance costs and insurance  some or all of the inflationary impact of these expenses will be borne by the tenants and not by the company 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in the company s borrowing costs and its general and administrative costs 
year the company s primary uses of software systems are for corporate and property accounting 
the company s current system is widely used by the real estate industry and is year compliant 
the company is replacing its current corporate and property accounting system with one which is also designed to be year compliant 
therefore  the company believes that the risk of year compliance is not significant as it relates to its computer software systems 
at this time  no estimates can be made as to any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of tenants and third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year the company is attempting to identify those risks as well as to receive compliance certificates from all third parties that have a material impact on the company s operations  but the cost and timing of third party year compliance is not within the company s control and no assurances can be given with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or the potential effects of any failure to comply
