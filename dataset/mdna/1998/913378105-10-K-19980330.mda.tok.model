the company currently markets its ubp universal brake parts line to warehouse distributors  mass market retailers  specialty  under the car distributors and national franchise and chain installers located throughout the united states and canada  principally through the company s salespeople  independent sales representatives and telemarketing 
the company has been named a primary private label brake rotor and drum supplier to several national buying groups 
net sales of brake rotors and other brake parts account for an increasingly significant portion of the company s total net sales and gross profits 
the following table sets forth  for the three years ended december   and  net sales attributable to brake parts and all other company operations as a percentage of total net sales  and gross profits attributable to sales of brake parts and sales from all other company operations as a percentage of total gross profits 
year ended december  of of of of of of total total total total total total net gross net gross net gross products sales profits sales profits sales profits brake parts all other operations 
total includes sales of brake rotors and drums  wheel cylinders and brake friction products 
includes sales of automotive hard parts  maintenance products and accessories on a warehouse distribution and wholesale basis through december   and for the period from october  through december  revenues from the company s hungarian foundry operations 
in october the company acquired the assets of csepel iron foundry works  a producer of high quality gray iron and ductile iron casting products  located in budapest  hungary 
the company manufactures iron casting products at its hungarian foundry primarily for the european automotive and machine tool industries 
the foundry is not presently equipped to manufacture high volume  smaller sized items such as brake rotors 
the company may at some time in the future upgrade the foundry including additional equipment purchases to produce iron castings for brake rotors  although the company has no present plans to make such upgrades 
all of the foundry s sales are in europe 
the company s strategy is to capitalize on the increasing demand for brake parts and the higher gross margins on sales of such brake parts by expanding its brake parts manufacturing and distribution business 
the company believes that it can implement its expansion strategy by i gaining additional market share of friction brake products  ii being a complete value line brake part supplier  iii possibly acquiring other specialty brake parts distributors  iv being a low cost producer of brake parts  v increasing its sku coverage to existing customers  and vi building brand recognition through the introduction of the company s ultimate brand brake parts a premium product 
the company may seek additional debt or equity financing to finance this expansion 
as part of the company s strategy to expand its specialty brake parts distribution business and increase its focus on this segment  the company has taken the following actions i april the company purchased the brake rotor and drum inventory and customer list of the passenger car division of mhd automotive  an illinois based distributor of brake parts  ii june the company acquired the inventory and customer list of north american rotor  inc  a distributor of brake drums and rotors  iii october the company acquired the assets of csepel iron foundry works  with a view toward potential future upgrading in order to eventually produce brake rotors for internal requirements  iv january the company  which owned of the outstanding stock of ubp friction  inc  a canadian based specialty manufacturer of brake friction parts  acquired the remaining of the outstanding capital stock  v march the company acquired the brake parts inventory and customer list of mpw brake supply of cambridge  massachusetts  an aftermarket brake parts distributor on the east coast  vi june the company acquired the assets and goodwill of north american friction inc  a canadian manufacturer of a brake friction component used in the company s brake friction manufacturing process  vii september the company substantially liquidated its non brake parts warehouse distribution division which enabled the company to utilize the financial  warehouse and personnel resources previously used by such division in the company s higher margin brake parts business 
liquidation was substantially completed by december   and viii november the company acquired all of the assets of the mci automotive division of excel industries which was in bankruptcy 
inventory was acquired at values substantially less than current market values and has been substantially sold 
the company also acquired a substantial number of additional brake rotor patterns and additional equipment to increase its manufacturing capacity 
the company was incorporated in delaware in january to act as a holding company for its direct and indirect subsidiaries including i universal automotive  inc  an illinois corporation and the predecessor of the company universal  ii ubp canholdings  inc  an ontario  canada corporation which changed its name from ontario limited which is the parent of universal brake parts  inc  an ontario  canada corporation which changed its name from aaron automotive industries  inc together ubp canholdings and international discus corporation  an ontario  canada corporation idc  and iii ubp hungary inc  a delaware corporation  which is the parent company of ubp csepel iron foundry kft  a hungarian limited liability company ubp hungary 
the company conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
the company s principal executive offices are located at north kedzie  chicago  illinois  and its telephone number is unless the context otherwise requires  the term the company includes universal automotive industries  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries  including its predecessor  universal automotive  inc industry overview general the automotive aftermarket is a mature industry undergoing rapid changes 
over the last seven years  there has been significant consolidation at the manufacturer and distributor level including several bankruptcies 
industry experts believe that consolidation activity will remain at a high level over the next several years 
the automotive aftermarket will benefit from consolidation by enjoying improved operating efficiencies through reduction of duplicate overhead costs  improved absorption at manufacturing plants  and reduced manufacturing costs 
aftermarket consumers will have less leverage as the number of suppliers diminishes 
domestic suppliers will have greater ability to compete with low cost offshore suppliers 
due to the rapid introduction of model changes by car manufacturers  the number of different parts to service the vehicle population has grown substantially 
this benefits the manufacturer with the necessary capital resources to invest in additional tooling 
the aftermarket distributors are forced to increase their inventory investment to service the timely requirements of their customers for parts 
parts proliferation benefits those companies in the aftermarket that are well capitalized with excellent management information systems capabilities 
vehicle operating systems have become increasingly complex 
this factor has led to a shrinking of the do it yourself market and a benefit to traditional distributors and those retailers targeting commercial business 
better installers will gain market share and car manufacturers may begin to operate free standing repair centers 
programmed distribution groups will have increased purchasing power 
traditional warehouse distributors aligned with major groups will prosper as a result of groups all or nothing attitude when group members support a single manufacturer for given categories 
this additional market clout will lead to further consolidation as manufacturers profit margins are compressed 
national wholesale and retail chains will have increased purchasing clout 
aggressive marketing by large  well financed chains results in reduced market prices  and an erosion of traditional warehouse distributors and jobbers without a commercial base 
these factors  in turn  fuel additional consolidation within the industry 
private label brands will grow and erode traditional brand name equity 
this movement favors low cost producers who operate with a value line concept 
the size of the automotive aftermarket will grow as the number of vehicles on the road constantly increases 
the average age of vehicles in use is increasing  the average age of all vehicles in was years compared to years in also  the average number of miles driven per vehicle continues to grow 
the company believes that consolidation and related shifts in the automotive aftermarket offer substantial opportunity for the company s value line concept of high quality low cost replacement parts offered to a broad cross section of the market 
the company believes that it is well positioned to become the only acceptable full brake parts value line alternative to the three remaining major branded suppliers in the market segments served 
brake system replacement parts the brake parts segment of the automotive after market is the segment of the industry experiencing the most growth 
while the overall market is growing at a rate of around per year following the total growth in the number of vehicles  the brake portion of the industry is enjoying growth of to per year 
this larger growth rate is supported by several factors increasing wear and tear on brakes  including changes in vehicle design  improved components eg  front wheel drive  semi metallic disc pads  abs braking system  increased speed limits  and an overall increase in the miles driven per year 
changes in vehicle design is the result of the introduction of front wheel drive vehicles in the mix of front to rear braking changed over the years from front rear to as high as front rear 
this equates to much higher heat on the front rotors as they are forced to do much more of the braking  and as a result  increased wear on rotors 
the government has mandated targets for improving fuel economy and imposed sizable taxes for not attaining such targets 
car manufacturers have generally chosen reducing vehicle weight as the short term method of improving fuel economy 
one of the prime targets has been the braking system which has always been over designed and  therefore  overweight 
rotors and calipers were reduced in size to help achieve these new weight targets  which reduces rotor and disc pad life 
lighter weight rotors are less costly than heavier rotors  and upon wearing down it is generally more cost effective to discard  rather than refurbish the rotors 
increased speed limits have increased braking system usage 
speed limits in several states have been increased from the mph of the mid s to as high as in some states 
this increase in speed requires almost more braking power to achieve the same stopping distance 
in response to these increased demands placed on braking systems  vehicle manufacturers created anti lock braking systems which electronically monitor the performance of each wheel to assure that is does not lock and skid  thus reducing the braking power of that wheel 
this system rapidly activates and releases pressure on a wheel to keep it from locking up and skidding 
this rapid action on the brake system tends to increase wear of the brake components 
specifications for bringing a vehicle to a complete stop from mph have been reduced from feet to feet 
to achieve this result  car manufacturers specify metallic brake pads which have shorter life and which  in turn  shortens the life of the brake rotor 
demands on the braking systems associated with these factors have increased dramatically to while the basic design of the systems has remained relatively constant 
the company believes that the brakes category of the automotive aftermarket will continue to grow at the to level well into the next decade 
products the company supplies a wide range of brake components to all levels of distribution 
company owned manufacturing facilities in both the us and canada produce brake drums and rotors as well as a full range of friction products  primarily disc brake pads and brake shoes 
the company purchases from unaffiliated vendors those products required to complete the product offering 
the company is one of four basic manufacturers in north america serving the aftermarket and the only value line supplier with basic manufacturing capability 
the company s value line competition do not have the breadth or scope of manufacturing capacity of the company  and are  therefore  subject to the competitive disadvantages inherent in dependence upon third party suppliers 
the development of this basic manufacturing capability has positioned the company to compete with the established brand names in the industry 
consolidation in the distribution and manufacturing segments of the brake aftermarket have left customers with fewer and fewer alternatives 
the company believes that this will offer substantial opportunities for increasing market penetration in the future 
marketing and distribution marketing the company currently markets products to all levels of distribution under the name ubp universal brake parts as well as under a number of private label programs for large buying groups  national franchise programs and installer chains 
the long term strategy  while growing the private label program  is to improve ubp brand recognition in the market place and position the company s product lines to compete with established branded products 
branded products generally are offered by the company s competitors at a premium price  thus offering customers who choose ubp products substantial opportunity for improved margin performance 
this group of competitors also currently commands approximately of the total brake market  making them a prime competitive target 
the company employs a sales force that directs the company s independent sales representative network and the other brake marketing activities 
arrangements with the company s independent sales representatives may be terminated at any time by either party 
the company also performs telemarketing operations directed at national franchise and chain installers 
distribution united states distribution is through two distribution facilities with the chicago facility acting as the primary facility  and a redistribution warehouse in southern california 
continuing growth in the distribution business will require additional space for the primary facility which is scheduled to be relocated to a larger space within the chicago area in the california facility was upgraded in to better service the growing west coast distribution 
canadian distribution is serviced through a primary facility in the toronto metropolitan area  with small satellite facilities servicing both the east and west coasts 
additional space may be required in the primary distribution facility at the end of its lease in february  as the canadian program continues to grow 
there can be no assurance that adequate space can be procured cost effectively at the conclusion of the present lease 
the company conducts a wholesale commodities operation from its headquarters facility in chicago  illinois  purchasing certain automotive replacement parts and maintenance items in large volume  at favorable prices  and reselling such products at slightly higher prices 
the company makes large volume purchases of products on the open market  generally buying from foreign and domestic manufacturers and other warehouse distributors  and resells such products to other warehouse distributors  mass market retailers and jobbers 
such operations result in gross margins that are significantly lower than gross margins from the company s other operations 
however  they generally require minimal resources of the company and do contribute to overall gross profit 
there can be no assurance that future market conditions will be favorable to the company s wholesale commodities operations or that the company will continue to generate sufficient revenues or acceptable profit margins from such wholesale operations 
for the years ended december    and  net sales from the company s wholesales commodities operations accounted for approximately  and of the company s total net sales  respectively  and  and of the company s total gross profits  respectively 
manufacturing the laredo  texas rotor machining facility has a current capacity of approximately  units on a two shift basis 
through the acquisition of excel industries mci operation in  approximately foundry tools were acquired  which provided the base to manufacture approximately different part numbers representing approximately of the company s total volume in the drum and rotor category 
the company established a relationship with waupaca foundry to supply raw castings as a result of its mci acquisition 
waupaca is the premier rotor casting vendor in north america 
the company acquired north american friction in to provide a basic friction manufacturing capability 
the company now offers a full line of a variety of friction grades in both riveted and integrally molded disc brake pads  which are the two largest segments of the friction segment of the brake industry 
the hungarian foundry acquired by the company in late is not presently equipped to produce raw iron casting for use in the manufacture of brake rotors 
the company would need to upgrade the foundry to produce rotors  which the company estimates would cost approximately  at present  the company has no plans to upgrade the foundry for this purpose 
a variety of factors  including demand for non rotor products in europe and the desire to continue supplying existing foundry customers and the availability of funding for upgrading  could limit the desirability or ability of the foundry to supply castings to the company 
suppliers and raw materials suppliers product selection and purchasing functions for the company s us brake parts business are centralized at the company s headquarters in chicago  illinois 
the company purchases the brake part skus that it does not manufacture from over a dozen suppliers located throughout the world 
currently  the company imports approximately of its brake part inventories with the exception of friction products from suppliers located in the people s republic of china  with the balance from various suppliers in mexico  taiwan  italy  the united states and canada 
although certain suppliers may provide a majority or all of the company s requirements for a particular product or product subcategory  no supplier accounted for more than of the company s us total product purchases during the company believes that the loss of any one or more of its suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on the company and that alternative sources of supply are readily available at comparable prices in all product categories 
the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good 
tariff the international trade commission ruled rotors sales from china materially injured us rotor manufacturers 
as a result of this affirmative determination  the us customs service has imposed anti dumping duties on certain chinese suppliers 
the dumping duties can be reviewed yearly if requested by a chinese manufacturer or by a us brake rotor manufacturer 
depending on the results of the investigation  the tariff may be decreased or increased 
the dumping margins are plant specific and are retroactive to the importer of record  however  the company is not the importer of record for this purpose 
warranties the manufacturers of automotive aftermarket products typically provide replacement warranties  which the company extends to its customers 
in general  the company is able to return to its suppliers slower moving or overstocked items for full credit  and the company typically exercises its discretion to extend this same policy to its customers 
raw materials the main components used in the company s brake rotor manufacturing operations are raw iron castings 
the company primarily purchases raw castings from waupaca foundry inc waupaca 
waupaca is the largest producer of automotive rotor castings in north america 
in addition to waupaca  the company purchases castings from several foundries in canada and one in mexico 
the company duplicates certain raw iron casting patterns used for the production of its better selling brake rotors and places such patterns at different foundries to assure a supply of the raw iron castings produced from such patterns 
although the company believes that it has developed good relationships with the foundries that supply the company s raw iron castings  any of such foundries could discontinue producing such castings for the company at any time 
the company believes that the number of foundries equipped to produce raw iron castings such as the ones used by the company in its manufacturing operations is limited 
the loss of any major foundry as a supplier of raw iron castings and an inability of the company to identify new foundries for the production of raw iron castings in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the foundries currently producing the company s raw iron castings will be able to accommodate the anticipated expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities 
the company is continuously seeking to locate additional foundries that would be suitable for the production of its raw iron castings 
the hungarian foundry acquired by the company is not presently equipped to produce raw iron castings for use in the manufacture of brake rotors and the company has no present intention to upgrade the foundry for this purpose 
competition the company s markets are highly competitive 
as a brake parts manufacturer and distributor  the company competes directly with other brake part manufacturers and brake parts distributors  including aimco a division of echlin  inc  raybestos brake products a division of echlin  inc  wagner brake products a division of cooper industries  inc  and bendix a division of alliedsignal co  as well as numerous value line distributors specializing in one specific brake category 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  inventory availability  delivery time and service 
many of the company s competitors in both the jobber and the specialty brake parts distribution markets are larger and have greater capital  management and other resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to compete successfully with such other competitors 
the company encountered certain competition in its foundry operations conducted in budapest  hungary  however  to date  the company s manufacturing capacity is at or near full capacity in the manufacture of iron casting products for the european automotive and machine tool market 
the company believes that there are fewer foundries competing in the european machine tool die casting business than in other areas of production 
trademark the company believes that the ubp universal brake parts label is important to its marketing efforts and a significant portion of the company s net sales are derived from sales of brake parts which it markets under its ubp universal brake parts label 
the ubp universal brake parts trademark has been registered with the united states patent and trademark office and canadian trademarks office 
there can be no assurance that prior registrations and or uses of the trademark or a confusingly similar mark do not exist in the united states  in which case the company might thereby be precluded from using such trademark in the united states 
the company can offer no assurance that the company s trademark would be upheld if challenged or that the company would not be prevented from using its trademark  both of which could have an adverse effect on the company 
employees as of december   the company s full time employees in the united states  in canada and in hungary were employed at the company s places of business in the united states  canada and hungary 
effective december  the company terminated its employee leasing agreement pursuant to which the company s united states employees were actually employed by the employee leasing company and leased to the company 
under this agreement  the employee leasing company provided the company s employees their medical  unemployment  workmen s compensation and disability insurance through group insurance plans maintained by the employee leasing company 
the company now provides these benefits directly to its employees 
risks affecting forward looking statements and stock prices in addition to those matters already set forth in item  business  the following may result in the company not achieving certain results included in any statement that may be considered a forward looking statement 
the company cautions the reader that the following risk factors may not be exhaustive 
expansion  possible need for additional financing the continued growth and financial performance of the company will depend in part on the company s ability to continue to expand its business through i gaining additional market share for friction brake products  ii the purchase of additional manufacturing machinery and brake rotor patterns to increase the number of brake rotor skus the company manufactures  iii the possible acquisition of other brake parts manufacturers or distributors on favorable terms  iv additional sales penetration of current customers  and v the successful operation of the company s hungarian foundry facility 
while the company regularly evaluates and discusses possible acquisitions  it has not entered into any commitment  agreement or understanding with any potential acquisition candidates  and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in locating suitable acquisition candidates or that any additional acquisitions will be consummated in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any operations that may be acquired can be effectively and profitably integrated into the company 
the company s future results will be affected by its ability to manage its operations and growth effectively and to continue to obtain an adequate supply of quality brake parts on a timely and cost effective basis to meet the growing demand for the company s ubp universal brake parts products 
the company can offer no assurance that any future expansion of its operations or acquisitions will not have an adverse effect on the company s operating results  particularly during the periods immediately following any such expansion or acquisition 
the company will be required to seek additional financing to fund its expansion through acquisitions or the upgrade of existing facilities 
the company has no current commitments or arrangements for additional financing and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the company may also issue common stock or other securities in connection with future acquisitions  resulting in additional dilution to existing stockholders 
legal proceedings set forth in item  legal proceedings below is a summary of the legal proceedings between the company and first national parts exchange  inc the estate 
the company has reserved  as a loss reserve with respect to such lawsuit 
there can be no assurance that such reserve is adequate 
in the event a judgment in excess of such sum is entered in favor of the estate  the company will be required to pay or bond over on appeal against such judgment 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to cover any judgment in excess of its resources 
bank financing the company has incurred significant indebtedness in connection with its operations 
as of december  the company s total consolidated indebtedness was approximately million 
a substantial portion of this indebtedness is secured by substantially all of the company s assets except the hungarian foundry assets and by a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
as a result of such indebtedness  the company i is prohibited from paying cash dividends pursuant to certain covenants and restrictions contained in the loan agreements governing such indebtedness  ii could be hindered in its efforts to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  and iii would be vulnerable to increases in interest rates since substantially all of the company s borrowings are at floating rates of interest 
on july   the company closed a line of credit with lasalle national bank of up to  based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory and a  term loan 
the line of credit bears interest at prime plus per annum  subject to an ongoing option to convert to libor plus per annum 
the revolving credit facility is for an initial term ending may  the term loan amortizes through may  and bears interest at prime plus per annum  with an ongoing option to convert to libor plus per annum 
on july   the company sold a  subordinated debenture to tandem capital  inc an affiliate of sirrom capital corporation tandem  calling for payments of interest only at per annum through maturity 
the company issued tandem a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price equal to of the average closing bid price of the company s common stock for the days preceding the first anniversary of the debenture closing date 
tandem will also receive warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock on the th of each of the following months august  february  august  august  and august  provided that if the debenture is prepaid before any scheduled warrant issue date except august  then all subsequent warrants will not be issued 
in each instance  the exercise price for the warrants is of the average closing bid price of the company s common stock for the days preceding each such warrant issue date 
the warrants are exercisable at any time through the sixth anniversary of the debenture issue date 
the amount allocated to such warrants is  which approximates the amount of increased interest the buyer would have required without a warrant feature 
dependence upon key personnel the company s continued success will depend to a significant degree upon the efforts and abilities of its senior management  in particular  yehuda tzur  arvin scott and eric goodman  its chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and executive vice president canadian operations  respectively 
the loss of the services of mr 
tzur  mr

acquisition of hungarian foundry in october the company acquired the assets of csepel iron foundry works  a producer of high quality gray iron and ductile iron casting products  located in budapest  hungary 
csepel iron foundry works has been a supplier of gray iron and ductile castings to the machine tool  transport and automotive industries in europe for over years 
the company is operating the foundry facility in its existing location and retained the existing management and manufacturing staff 
the company has renovated the foundry to improve its existing manufacturing facilities 
the company can offer no assurance that its foundry operations will be successful 
the company s investment in the hungarian facility involves certain special risks not usually associated with an investment in a us company  including risks related to i greater social  economic and political uncertainty  ii certain restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of capital  iii exchange control regulations  iv currency exchange rate fluctuations  which may increase the costs associated with conversion of the investment principal and income from one currency to another  v higher rates of inflation  vi greater governmental involvement in the economy  and vii the application of certain environmental regulations to the foundry property 
insurance although the company currently has general liability insurance for all its operations  prior to september the company did not have general or products liability insurance for its brake rotor manufacturing operations 
the company would be adversely affected if it should incur liability for a general or products liability claim relating to an incident which occurred prior to the time the company obtained general and products liability coverage for its manufacturing operations 
to date  no such claim has been asserted against the company 
in addition  the company would be adversely affected by the incurrence of liability which is not covered by insurance or is in excess of policy limits 
no dividends the company does not currently intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future and anticipates that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of its business 
moreover  the company s bank lines of credit prohibit the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
prospective investors should not expect the company to pay dividends on its common stock until such time  if any  that the company is able  if at all  to obtain a release of the prohibition on the payments of dividends imposed by the terms of its credit facilities 
any payment of future dividends and the amounts thereof will be dependent upon the company s earnings  financial requirements  and other factors deemed relevant by the company s board of directors  including the company s contractual obligations 
exercise of warrants the  units sold by the company in connection with its initial public offering ipo in december were comprised of one share of common stock and one redeemable common stock purchase warrant the warrants entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments  at any time until december   unless previously redeemed 
in connection with the ipo  the company issued warrants the underwriter s warrants entitling the underwriter to purchase from the company  at an exercise price per underwriter s warrant of  up to  units comprised of one share of common stock and one warrant 
on january   the underwriter and its assignees exercised the underwriter s warrants then held an aggregate of  warrants 
based on the underwriting agreement  the holders of such underwriter s warrants elected to exchange shares of common stock  shares whose then current market value was equal to the total required exercise price of   units at 
thus  an additional  shares of common stock were issued to the underwriter  or certain employees thereof  who had been assigned certain of such underwriter s warrants without any cash consideration to the company 
the exercise price of the underwriter s warrants included in such units is of the exercise price of the aforementioned warrants issued to the public or 
such warrants have not yet been exercised 
for the life of the warrants  the holders thereof are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price for the company s securities without assuming the risk of ownership  with a resulting dilution in the interest of other security holders 
as long as such warrants remain unexercised  the terms under which the company could obtain additional capital may be adversely affected 
moreover  the holders of such warrants may be expected to exercise them at a time when the company would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of its securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such warrants

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary liquidity needs are associated with carrying accounts receivable and maintaining inventories 
the company relies on internally generated funds  credit made available from suppliers and senior and subordinated lines of credit 
the company s working capital needs are generally not seasonal in nature  although business slows down slightly during the winter months 
the company has incurred significant indebtedness to date in connection with its operations 
as of december  the company s total consolidated indebtedness was approximately million 
a substantial portion of this indebtedness is secured by substantially all of the company s assets except the hungarian foundry assets and by a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
as a result of such indebtedness  the company i is prohibited from paying cash dividends pursuant to certain covenants and restrictions contained in the loan agreements governing such indebtedness  ii could be hindered in its efforts to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  and iii would be vulnerable to increases in interest rates since substantially all of the company s borrowings are at floating rates of interest

tandem will also receive warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock on the th of each of the following months august  february  august  august  and august  provided that if the debenture is prepaid before any scheduled warrant issue date except august  then all subsequent warrants will not be issued 
in each instance  the exercise price for the warrants is of the average closing bid price of the company s common stock for the days preceding each such warrant issue date

the company believes that cash generated from operations  borrowings under the company s bank line of credit and credit from its suppliers is sufficient to fund its working capital requirements and capital expenditures through seasonality the company s business is slightly seasonal in nature  primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on the demand for automotive replacement parts 
historically  the company s sales and profits have been slightly higher in the second and third calendar quarters of each year than in the first or fourth quarters 
effects of inflation the company historically has been able to diminish the effects of inflationary cost expenses through increased prices to customers and productivity improvements 
non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have generally been offset through price increases 
year compliance the company has reviewed the computer systems and related software in use throughout its operations that could be affected by the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
thus  time sensitive software may recognize a date using the digits as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations 
the company uses software under license from various vendors 
the company has learned that the software in use is either fully year compliant or  in one instance  will be fully year compliant in an upgrade version to be installed in the first half of the company believes that the cost of installation and testing will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations
