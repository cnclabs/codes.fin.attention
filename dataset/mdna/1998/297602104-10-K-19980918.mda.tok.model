reporting comprehensive income and no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
requires companies to report comprehensive income and sfas no 
requires companies to report segment information as it is used internally to evaluate segment performance 
these statements merely provide for additional disclosure requirements 
the company is required to adopt these new standards in fiscal during  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa released its statement of position no 
sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and statement of position no 
sop reporting on the costs of start up activities  both of which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sop requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
sop also requires that the costs related to the preliminary project stage and the post implementation stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
sop requires that the costs of start up activities be expensed as incurred 
currently  the company defers all costs incurred prior to the opening of a new ethan allen owned store and amortizes these costs over the store s first twelve months of operations 
sop requires companies to report the initial application of the standard as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the company is not required to adopt these standards until fiscal management believes that the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on the company s results 
year the company expects to implement the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues and does not believe the cost of such actions will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  there is no guarantee that the company  its suppliers or other third parties will be able to make all of the modifications necessary to address year issues on a timely basis 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company views all of its retail  wholesale and manufacturing applications as mission critical 
the company recently converted its retail  wholesale and a portion of its manufacturing applications onto one single mid range computer  utilizing newly acquired integrated software 
the newly implemented software is substantially compliant  with all date fields expanded to four digits 
the company has set up a redundant environment and has rolled the date forward to the year and is testing all of its business transactions 
the testing of these recently implemented applications is expected to be completed by december  concurrently with the aforementioned project  the company has been remediating its pre existing manufacturing systems 
this process is complete in the company s wood manufacturing facilities 
substantial progress has been made in the company s upholstered and accessory manufacturing systems 
these systems are expected to be fully compliant by december  investments have been made in the company s peripheral hardware 
these investments were necessitated by the retail and wholesale systems conversion 
the company is currently compiling a list of hardware and associated software that has not been recently replaced 
the company expects all hardware to be remediated or replaced by june  the company s vertical integrated structure might to some degree mitigate the impact of third parties year issues to adversely affect the company 
however  the company anticipates the possibility that not all of its vendors  retailers and other third parties will have taken the necessary steps to adequately address their respective year issues on a timely basis 
in order to minimize the impact on the company  a project team has been formed to monitor the activities of third parties  including sending out inquiries and evaluating responses 
notwithstanding the progress the company has made thus far in remediating its existing systems and implementing new systems  the company is proceeding in drafting a formal contingency plan 
the company intends to continue monitoring the progress of others in order to determine whether adequate services will be provided to run the company s operations in the year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at june   the company had no short term debt outstanding and total long term debt outstanding of million 
currently  the company has outstanding only one debt instrument principal amount of million which has a variable interest rate 
using a yield to maturity analysis and assuming an increase in the interest rate on this debt of basis points fluctuation in the rate  interest rate variability on this debt would not have a material effect on the company s financial results 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instruments transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure
