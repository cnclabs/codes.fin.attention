certain factors that may affect future operating results this report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors of which the company is aware that may cause the company s actual results to vary materially from those forecasted or projected in any such forward looking statement 
the following are certain  but not necessarily all  of the factors that the management of the company currently believes could cause the company s actual operating results to be materially less than forecasted or projected in any forward looking statement 
the company received of its revenues in from microsoft 
the company s agreement with microsoft with respect to the licensing of the company s proofing tools products expired at the end of  and has not been renewed 
as a result of the termination of its most significant license with microsoft  the company expects that revenues from microsoft will decline substantially in the company anticipates that in it will receive the majority of its revenues from direct and indirect sales efforts aimed at corporations and government agencies 
the marketing and distribution of products to these markets  either by the company or by value added resellers or distributors  requires higher sales and marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenues than the oem distribution channel  which is likely to have a negative impact on the company s operating margins 
the company intends to expand this activity through greater sales efforts and the introduction of new solutions for enterprise use  which could increase the level of sales and marketing expenditures relative to revenues 
the company anticipates that a substantial and increasing portion of its future revenue will come from corporate and government sales  which is likely to result in lower operating margins in future periods 
the company s ability to remain competitive in the computer software industry is dependent on the services of a number of key management and technical personnel  principally software engineers 
personnel costs for technical staff represent a significant portion of the company s operating expenses  and increased competition and related personnel cost increases for such staff could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
additionally  a shortage of engineering resources with sgml and xml talent could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
during  costs for software developers and personnel experienced in the software industry increased significantly  a trend which is likely to continue in this could result in reduced operating margins as a result of higher personnel costs 
the company has historically operated in narrow market segments that have attracted fewer substantial participants than the general market for software applications 
as the company develops solutions for license on an enterprise basis  the company anticipates that it will experience increased competition  both as to quality and price  from substantial entities with greater resources than those of the company 
the company has invested significant development resources in products utilizing standards based publishing formats  such as html and xml 
should any such standard not ultimately be adopted by large numbers of customers and potential customers  it is possible that there may be a limited market for the products currently under development by the company  which could have an adverse impact on future revenues and operating results 
the company has historically received a significant portion of its revenues from oems that integrate the company s products with their own products and market them to end users as a single unit 
the business of the company s oem customers is intensely competitive  while the computer software industry has continued to consolidate 
as a result  the number of potentially significant oem customers for the company s products has declined and there is increasing competitive pressure for the company s existing and potential customers to reduce costs 
also  certain markets for the company s products were particularly adversely affected by competitive pressures during  a trend that is likely to continue in at the same time  the company has achieved a high degree of market penetration in certain oem markets for its products  making it more difficult for the company to make new sales to oem customers 
these factors could result in decreased revenues from oems in future periods 
it is possible that certain of the major operating system developers  including microsoft  may add features and functionality to such operating systems  including future versions of windows registered trademark and windows nt registered trademark  that may compete with the company s products or with those of its other oem customers 
the concentration of the market for operating systems makes it difficult or impossible for the company or its other oem customers to compete on a price basis because purchasers of operating systems would be required to purchase products as part of the operating system that compete with those of the company 
in addition  certain oem customers  such as microsoft  may choose to internally develop products that compete with those of the company in order to reduce their costs 
the company has experienced growth that could place a significant strain on its resources 
the company s historical and projected growth has come from a combination of growth from internally developed products and the successful acquisition and integration of businesses and assets 
changes in the market for mergers and acquisitions of software companies and information databases could make it more difficult for the company to achieve projected or forecasted revenue or net income growth in future periods 
the company s ability to manage any future growth and integrate any newly acquired business will require it to continue to improve its operations and its financial and management information systems  and to motivate and effectively manage its employees 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to integrate and manage successfully businesses or assets that it has acquired or may acquire in the future 
if the company s management is unable to manage such growth effectively  the quality of the company s products  its ability to identify  hire  and retain key personnel  and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company has increased the marketing of its products directly to customers outside the united states and has experienced an increase in revenues from foreign sources in the majority of this growth is attributable to increased sales of products to corporate and consumer customers in foreign markets 
the marketing of products directly to customers outside the united states increases the risk to the company s revenues associated with fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
such fluctuations could also result in increased operating expenses associated with foreign operations
