item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein 
overview the company provides a broad range of integrated telecommunications products and services  primarily to business customers located in the western continental united states and hawaii 
the company s digital networks currently serve markets in arizona  california  hawaii  idaho  new mexico  texas  washington and guam 
in addition  the company has networks under construction which  when completed  will serve two additional markets and expand its regional footprint to oregon 
the company also constructs  markets and manages longhaul fiber optic facilities  principally in arizona  california and hawaii 
the company s longhaul fiber optic facilities currently extend approximately route miles and an additional  route miles are expected to become operational over the next months 
the company s full line of products  which offer a one stop solution to customers telecommunications services requirements  include long distance  internet  data transmission  and private line services  and local dial tone services  which were recently introduced 
the company has invested significant capital and effort in developing its telecommunications business 
this capital has been invested in the development of the company s networks and longhaul fiber optic facilities  for the hiring and development of an experienced management team  the development and installation of operating systems  the introduction of services  marketing and sales efforts and for acquisitions 
the company expects to continue to make capital expenditures to expand its networks and longhaul fiber optic facilities and broaden its service offerings and may consummate additional acquisitions 
proper management of the company s growth will require the company to maintain quality control over its services and to expand the company s internal management  technical and accounting systems  all of which will require substantial investment 
the company changed its fiscal year end from september th to december st in order to align financial reporting with regulatory reporting and to the reporting of others in the company s industry sector 
the company is providing investors audited financial information for the three month transition period ended december  and will provide audited financial information for the subsequent month periods ending december st 
as a result of the limited revenues and significant expenses associated with the expansion and development of its networks and services  the company s operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
local services 
to facilitate its entry into local services  the company has in service eight high capacity digital switches and has installed and is currently testing six additional high capacity digital switches that are expected to become operational by the end of the first quarter of as demand warrants  the company plans to continue to install switching equipment in its operational networks  in markets where it is constructing networks and in certain other cities where the company will rely on ilec facilities for transmission 
once a switch is operational  where regulatory conditions permit  the company intends to offer local dial tone  in addition to enhanced services such as isdn  centrex  voice mail and other custom calling features 
the company expects negative ebitda from its switched services during the to month period after a switch is deployed 
for switches operating in conjunction with the company s networks  the company expects operating margins to improve as the network is expanded and larger volumes of traffic are carried on the company s network 
for switches operating in cities where the company will rely on ilec facilities for transmission  the company will experience lower or negative operating margins under current ilec pricing tariffs 
although under the telecommunications act the ilecs will be required to unbundle local tariffs  permitting the company to purchase only the origination and termination services it needs  thereby decreasing operating expenses  there can be no assurance that such unbundling will be effected in a timely manner and result in prices favorable to the company 
long distance services 
the company offers basic and enhanced long distance services  such as toll free  calling card  prepaid calling card and international call back services  targeting primarily business customers purchasing between and  of services per month as well as resellers and other carriers 
as part of its strategy  the company has acquired a number of long distance carriers and intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of long distance carriers in the future 
the company purchases long distance capacity under agreements with certain major long distance carriers that provide the company capacity at rates that vary with the monthly traffic generated by the company 
the company is obligated to satisfy certain minimum monthly usage requirements of an aggregate of million per month as of january   increasing to a maximum of million per month over the next three years 
if such requirements are not satisfied  the company may be required to pay an underutilization fee in addition to its monthly bill 
internet services 
the company presently offers internet related services in most of its markets  such as dedicated internet services  web site development and hosting  provides access and upstream transport for local isps  edi and electronic commerce services and is in the process of developing various internet software applications 
the company also offers dial up internet services to customers in portland oregon  vancouver washington  the state of hawaii and select markets in california and intends to begin offering such services in the los angeles  san francisco and houston metropolitan areas in management believes that these services will become an important component of the company s overall product offerings and intends to continue to expand its internet access and service business to other markets 
data services 
the company offers national and international frame relay services on its own frame relay network and through interconnection agreements with other data service providers 
under these agreements  the company and such data service providers have agreed to link their data networks and terminate one another s traffic 
the company has deployed cascade communications frame relay switches in markets in the western united states 
such switches can provide both frame relay and internet services 
the company is leveraging its infrastructure and network experience to offer data networking services such as atm  high speed lan connectivity  video conferencing  multimedia networking  frame relay and high capacity access to the internet 
the company has one atm switch commercially operational in each of los angeles and ontario  california 
network operations 
the development  construction and expansion of the company s networks requires significant capital  a large portion of which is invested before any revenue is generated 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  negative ebitda and losses while it expands its network operations and builds its customer base 
based on its experience to date and that of its competitors  the company estimates that a new network will generate ebitda within to months after commencement of commercial operations 
construction periods and operating results will vary from network to network 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish a sufficient revenue generating customer base or achieve ebitda on a consolidated basis 
management estimates that the total costs associated with the purchase and installation of fiber optic cable and high speed electronic transmission equipment  including capitalized engineering costs  will range from million to million per network  depending upon the size of the market served and the scope and complexity of the network 
actual costs may vary significantly from this range 
the amounts and timing of these expenditures are subject to a variety of factors that may vary significantly by the geographic and demographic characteristics of each market 
in addition to capital expenditure requirements  upon commencement of the construction phase of a network  the company begins to incur direct operating costs for such items as salaries and rent 
as network construction progresses  the company incurs rights of way costs and increased sales and marketing expenses 
the initial development of a network may take as long as six months  depending upon the size and complexity of the network and a variety of factors  including the time required to obtain rights of way and other governmental approvals  such as franchise agreements 
once actual construction commences  it may take from two to six months to complete the initial backbone segment of a network 
the time required during the construction phase is significantly influenced by the number of route miles involved  the mix of aerial versus underground fiber deployment  possible delays in receiving fiber optic cable  electronic equipment and required permits and other factors

in addition  action telcom manufactures the network analysis management system nams  a unix based software and hardware platform that provides automated real time billing record collection  fraud protection and network design 
the company has entered into a year reseller agreement with magnacom  a company owned by pni which is in turn controlled by john warta  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  pursuant to which the company has paid magnacom approximately million as prepayments for future pcs services 
the company and magnacom are presently in negotiations with respect to modifying their agreement to reflect certain regulatory requirements and to provide clarification as to the basis upon which the company and magnacom will provide such services 
in addition  the company has been granted a conditional option to acquire up to pni s entire interest in magnacom currently  conditioned upon magnacom and the company entering into an agreement for the construction and or operation of magnacom s facilities 
if and when the condition precedent is met  the exercise of the option will be subject to compliance with all applicable fcc regulations relating to prior approval of any transfer of control of pcs licenses  including those relating to the foreign ownership of licenses 
accordingly  until such time as fcc regulations or administrative action permit the company to own in excess of of magnacom  the option by its term is limited to a interest in magnacom 
the company  magnacom and pni are in negotiations with respect to modifying the option in order to provide  among other things  that the company own no more than a interest in magnacom upon exercise of such option 
magnacom is currently negotiating with a telecommunications equipment vendor to provide equipment and other financing and to invest in magnacom 
the terms of any such transaction may include the issuance by the company to such vendor of a warrant to purchase up to of the then outstanding common shares 
if such warrant is issued  the company will record a one time noncash charge in an amount equal to the value of the warrant 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that the value of such a warrant could be between million and million  depending on the terms of the warrant

there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company or  if available  that it can be concluded on terms acceptable to the company or within the limitations contained within the company s financing arrangements 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s development or expansion plans and could have material adverse effect on the company s business 
such failure could also limit the ability of the company to make principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness 
the company has no material working capital or other credit facility under which it may borrow for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance that such a facility will be available to the company in the future or that if such a facility were available  that it would be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company
