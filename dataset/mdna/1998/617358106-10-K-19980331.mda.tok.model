impact of year some of the company s older purchased software applications were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year

the company is in the process of completing an assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software to ensure that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total cost of this year project has not been fully quantified  but preliminary assessments are that conversion costs will be immaterial to the company 
the company believes that with the necessary modifications to existing software and any necessary conversions to new software  the year issue does not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the cost of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
the company has not completed an evaluation of its major customers and suppliers to determine if they have taken adequate measures to ensure that necessary modifications are made to their software prior to the year while the company is not dependent on any one customer or supplier  failure to make necessary year modifications by any large group of customers or suppliers could result in a material adverse impact on the company
