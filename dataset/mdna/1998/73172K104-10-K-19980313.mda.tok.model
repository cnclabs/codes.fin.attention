overview polycom was incorporated in december to develop  manufacture and market audioconferencing  dataconferencing and videoconferencing products that facilitate meetings at a distance 
polycom was engaged principally in research and development from inception through september  when it began volume shipments of its first audioconferencing product  soundstation 
as of december   polycom s audioconferencing product line consisted principally of the soundstation  soundstation ex  soundstation premier  and soundpoint 
polycom began shipping its first dataconferencing product  showstation  in november in october  polycom announced enhancements to its audio and dataconferencing product lines and its first videoconferencing product  the viewstation which are discussed later in this section 
in january  the company acquired all the outstanding shares of viavideo communications  inc in a stock transaction valued at million 
viavideo is a development stage company dedicated to the development of videoconferencing equipment 
polycom s viewstation product comes about as a result of the merger and commenced first customer shipments in the first quarter of polycom markets its products domestically and internationally through a network of value added resellers vars  original equipment manufacturers oems  and retailers and also sells its audioconferencing products through its direct sales force 
through december   polycom has derived a substantial majority of its net revenues from sales of its soundstation products 
polycom anticipates that sales of its soundstation product line will continue to account for a substantial majority of net revenues at least through the year ending december  any factor adversely affecting the demand or supply for the soundstation product line could materially adversely affect polycom s business  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
from inception through the nine month period ended september   the company incurred losses from operations  primarily as a result of its investments in the development of its products and the expansion of its sales and marketing  manufacturing and administrative organizations 
the company achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of and generated a small operating income in each quarter of fiscal the company incurred a quarterly operating loss in each quarter of the company intends to continue to invest significantly in research and development  and plans to operate with an operating loss or break even results  excluding acquisition expenses  through the first quarter of there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its operating plans or achieve profitable operations in any subsequent period 
in march  polycom entered into a joint marketing and development agreement the first agreement with m 
under the agreement  m provided million in funding to polycom for certain deliverables related to the development of the next generation dataconferencing product and will also provide shared technology resources for the development of future products 
through december   polycom recorded the million as revenue  million in each of the first three quarters of  based on delivery of the items specified in the contract 
the amounts recognized as revenue approximates the amount that would have been recognized using the percentage of completion methodology 
additionally  polycom has granted m exclusive private label rights in certain distribution channels to the products developed under this agreement subject to certain minimum volumes 
further  m received warrants to purchase up to  shares of polycom s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire in march  which may be extended until march depending on the delivery of polycom s first product developed under the agreement 
at the time of grant  the warrants were valued using the black scholes model and were determined to have a value of  m also has certain rights of first offer under its stock warrant agreement with polycom which will give m the right  for a period of days after the effective time  to purchase additional shares of polycom common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in february  m exercised this option and purchased approximately one million shares of polycom common stock for a consideration of approximately million 
as a result of the purchase  m owns approximately of outstanding polycom common stock 
in june  polycom entered into a second joint marketing and development agreement the second agreement with m 
under this agreement  m is expected to provide million in funding to polycom for certain deliverables related to the development of videoconferencing products and may also provide shared technology resources for the development of future products 
however  in order to receive the funding  polycom must meet certain milestones as outlined in the agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet these milestones or receive the funding 
if polycom does not receive this funding from m  it will have a material adverse impact on the profitability of the company 
polycom will grant m exclusive private label rights in certain distribution channels to the products developed under this agreement 
as of december   polycom has not recognized any revenue under this agreement 
as mentioned above  in june polycom signed an agreement under which polycom would acquire viavideo 
this acquisition of viavideo adds a videoconferencing product and engineering team to polycom s audioconferencing and dataconferencing product portfolio 
in december  the shareholders of both companies voted to approve the merger and  on january   the merger became effective 
on january   under the terms of the agreement  million shares of polycom common stock  plus an additional million shares based on option grants by viavideo  were exchanged for all outstanding shares and options of viavideo 
the transaction is being accounted for as a pooling of interests and qualifies as a tax free reorganization 
in october  polycom announced a new set of data  video and audioconferencing products to add to its existing line 
in the dataconferencing market  polycom announced its new showstation ip product which is its next generation conference room projector 
the showstation ip is targeted to be available in north america in the first quarter of and in europe and asia pacific on a country by country basis over the following several months 
in the videoconferencing arena  polycom introduced the new viewstation product family which includes a kbps version  providing enhanced video performance  or a kbps kbps version which provides premium quality full motion video 
the kbps version began shipping in north america in the first quarter of while the kbps kbps version has a targeted first customer ship date in april in the audioconferencing market  polycom introduced the soundstation premier satellite which is a unique enhanced system that works in conjunction with polycom s soundstation premier conference phone 
the soundstation premier satellite began shipping in north america in december there can be no assurance that any products not yet commercially available will be available by polycom s targeted dates and the lack of availability of these products will materially affect polycom s financial results 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated

year ended december  audioconferencing net revenues    cost of net revenues    gross profit    gross margin dataconferencing net revenues    cost of net revenues   gross profit  gross margin net revenues total net revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to the same period in the audioconferencing net revenues for were up million  or  when compared to this increase was due to the introduction of the new premier and soundpoint product lines in this division  which was partially offset by price reductions for the soundstation product line 
for soundstation  unit sales increased over the same period in dataconferencing revenues were million for versus million for this increase was due entirely to the revenue associated with the first agreement with m which offset significant showstation unit volume decreases 
net revenues increased million  or  when comparing to audioconferencing net revenues increased to million in from the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales  resulting from the increased market acceptance of polycom s audioconferencing product line  and  to a lesser extent  through the expansion of polycom s north american and international distribution networks  offset in part by a decline in the list price of its soundstation products 
dataconferencing net revenues increased to million in when compared to the increase was due to increased product shipments 
the first dataconferencing products began shipping in november and did not have any net revenues prior to this time 
during  and  polycom derived a substantial majority of its net revenues from sales of its soundstation product family 
lucent technologies accounted for of net revenues in and confertech accounted for of net revenues in no other customer or reseller accounted for more than of polycom s net revenues during the periods 
international net revenues accounted for   and of total net revenues for   and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for business segment information 
in  price reductions offset unit growth internationally and the million in revenue associated with the first m agreement offset other product revenue growth in the company s international business 
the reduction in the percentage of international net revenues for from resulted from initial sales of the soundpoint and soundstation premier product families  which were introduced first in north america 
polycom anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  international net revenues may fluctuate in the future as polycom introduces new products since polycom expects to initially introduce such products in north america and also because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
additionally  the recent economic problems in the asian market could adversely offset the company s profitability if it continues in to the extent polycom is unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  polycom s business  financial condition  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that polycom will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for polycom s products 
to date  a substantial majority of polycom s international sales have been denominated in us currency  however  polycom expects that in the future more international sales may be denominated in local currencies 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of polycom s manufacturing organization  contract manufacturers  tooling depreciation  warranty expense and an allocation of overhead expenses 
the cost of net revenues represented of net revenue in compared to in the audioconferencing cost of net revenues percentage was in versus in the the increase in audioconferencing cost of net revenue percentage is primarily attributable to the soundstation price reduction implemented in north america in january and the price reduction implemented in the international regions in april also  the costs associated with transitioning the soundstation and premier product manufacturing to ims in thailand and the introduction of a lower margin audio product contributed to the higher cost of net revenues percentage 
the dataconferencing cost of net revenues was in compared to in in the dataconferencing division  the decrease in the cost of net revenues percentage was primarily due to the revenue received under the first agreement with m  which had very low associated costs 
although polycom s dataconferencing division will not receive revenue associated with deliverables from the first agreement with m in  the dataconferencing cost of net revenues is expected to decrease in due to the introduction of the next generation showstation product and a royalty revenue stream associated with the first agreement with m 
when comparing to  the cost of net revenue percentage increased to in from in the audioconferencing cost of net revenue percentage decreased to in from in which was due cost reductions in the soundstation product line  partially offset by the negative impact of the price reduction in the first quarter of the dataconferencing cost of net revenues percentage increased to in from in this increase was due to higher costs associated with the manufacturing start up of the showstation product and lower than planned unit volume which generated unfavorable manufacturing cost variances 
polycom expects that the overall cost of net revenues percentage will remain at current levels in cost of net revenue percentage increases due to increased sales of lower margin audio products should be offset by cost of net revenue percentage decreases due to increased royalty streams associated with the video and data products and the m video revenue associated with deliverables connected with the second agreement with m which is expected to be recognized in the first half of  however there can be no assurances that this will happen 
due to significant dependence on uncertain items such as the royalty revenue stream  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs related to the new data and video products  and timing of sales within each quarter of  the cost of net revenues percentage can fluctuate significantly 
there can be no assurances on achieving profitability targets due to these and other uncertainties 
polycom s historical price reductions have been driven by polycom s desire to expand the market for its products  and polycom may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry higher costs in order to further expand the market or to respond to competitive pricing pressures 
there can be no assurance that such actions by polycom will expand the market for its products or be sufficient to meet competitive pricing pressures 
in the future  the cost of net revenue percentage may be affected by price competition and changes in unit volume shipments  product cost and warranty expenses 
the cost of net revenues percentage may also be impacted by the mix of distribution channels used by polycom  the mix of products sold and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
polycom typically realizes lower cost of net revenue percentages on direct sales than on sales through indirect channels 
if sales through resellers  especially oems  increase as a percentage of total revenues  polycom s cost of net revenues percentage will be adversely impacted 
in june  polycom began manufacturing the soundstation products at a manufacturing contractor based in thailand 
during the third quarter of  this same manufacturer also began producing the premier product family 
although the transition of the manufacturing process to the thailand manufacturer caused an unfavorable cost variance in the initial phase  polycom realized lower audioconferencing cost of net revenues in the fourth quarter of  primarily in soundstation and premier product families  and expects this trend to continue for these products  although there can be no assurances that this will occur 
additionally  in july  polycom moved its distribution and product repair center to a new location in livermore  california 
this move is expected to provide polycom with better control over its distribution and repair activities and may improve overall warranty and service costs  although there are no assurances that this will happen 
sales and marketing expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues the increase in absolute dollars in and was primarily related to the expansion of polycom s sales and marketing organization  primarily for the direct sales force and associated costs  and increased commission expenses related to higher sales volumes 
additionally  in compliance with a joint services agreement with viavideo  polycom incurred  and billed out as a credit to its expense  charges related to marketing work done on behalf of viavideo 
in  the sales and marketing expense increase was related to the launch of polycom s dataconferencing business 
polycom expects to continue to increase its sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts in an effort to expand north american and international markets  market new products and establish and expand distribution channels 
in particular  due to the innovative nature of the showstation ip and viewstation products  polycom believes it will be required to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing  including advertising  to educate potential customers as to the desirability of these products 
further  due to uncertainties concerning the service and support requirements of the showstation ip and viewstation products  polycom may experience higher customer support charges in the future 
also  compensation and benefits for the new vice president of marketing will cause an increase in marketing and sales expense in the future 
also  the company will likely incur additional expenses related to the liquidation of the showstation product in latin america 
further  due in large part to the merger with viavideo  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues which will materially adversely affect the profitability of polycom 
research and development expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  outside services  consulting fees  an allocation of overhead expense  supplies and depreciation 
the increase in dollar amount in research and development expenses in and was primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated support required to expand and enhance polycom s dataconferencing and audioconferencing product lines 
as of december   all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
also  in compliance with a joint services agreement with viavideo  polycom incurred  and billed out as a credit to its expense  charges related to development work done on behalf of viavideo 
polycom believes that technological leadership is critical to its success and is committed to continuing a high level of research and development 
consequently  polycom intends to increase its research and development expenses in absolute dollars in the future 
further  due in large part to the merger with viavideo  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues which will materially adversely affect the profitability of polycom 
general and administrative expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  an allocation of overhead expense  and outside legal and accounting expenses 
the increase in dollar amount in and was primarily due to increased staffing  including the hiring of a president at the beginning of  to support polycom s growth and  during  to costs related to patent litigation 
polycom believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of polycom s administrative staff and infrastructure and additional information technology improvements to support a larger company 
further  due in large part to the merger with viavideo and the addition of its management staff  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues which will materially adversely affect the profitability of polycom 
acquisition expenses in  polycom incurred expenses totaling million related to the acquisition of viavideo 
a significant portion of these charges were for outside legal  accounting and consulting services 
there can be no assurances that polycom will not incur additional acquisition related charges in subsequent quarters associated with the merger with viavideo or that management will be successful in its efforts to integrate the operations of the acquired company 
there are significant risks associated with the acquisition of viavideo including but not limited to i difficulties in generating enough videoconferencing revenue to offset the substantial operating expenses associated with this product family  ii difficulties in integration of the companies  iii difficulties in maintaining revenue levels during product transitions  iv difficulties or delays in achieving product and technology integration benefits  and v increased competition from other videoconferencing companies 
further  the acquisition relates to a company that is in its early stage of development 
as a result  polycom believes that the increases in costs of net revenues and in operating expenses associated with the development and integration of these technologies will  in the near term  greatly exceed any associated increases in net revenues  which will have an adverse impact on operating results 
other income and expense and provision for income taxes interest income consists of interest earned on polycom s cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense is from polycom s bank debt facilities 
interest income  net of interest expense was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in was due to the increase in polycom s cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of its initial public offering in the second quarter of in addition  interest expense recorded in is insignificant due to the reduction in debt after the initial public offering 
the increase in interest income  net of interest expense  in over was primarily due to the increase in polycom s cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from polycom s initial public offering 
polycom accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
in and polycom provided for income tax of  and  respectively  for federal and certain foreign alternative minimum taxes 
polycom incurred a net loss and consequently paid no federal or state income taxes in in and beyond  polycom is targeting to realize increasingly profitable results which will generate significantly higher federal and state income tax expense  although there can be no assurance polycom will achieve profitable results 
as of december   polycom had approximately million in federal net operating loss carryforwards and million in federal tax credit carryforwards 
the future utilization of polycom s net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations upon certain changes in ownership 
polycom believes that its initial public offering on april  triggered a change in ownership pursuant to the internal revenue code of  as amended  such that the annual limitation for utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards is approximately million 
the viavideo acquisition may trigger an additional limitation in polycom has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
management evaluates on a quarterly basis the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be appropriately reduced 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other factors affecting future operations polycom s net revenues have grown primarily through increased market acceptance of its established audioconferencing product line  new product introductions and through the expansion of polycom s north american and international distribution networks 
while polycom has experienced growth in net revenues in recent quarters  it does not believe that the historical growth rates in net revenues will be sustainable nor are they indicative of future operating results 
for example  polycom believes that the price reduction in the north american list price of its soundstation product line  effective december for resellers and january for end user customers  and the price reduction for soundstation products sold internationally effective april  negatively impacted polycom s net revenues and profitability and will continue to negatively impact net revenues and profitability throughout polycom believes that profitability could continue to be negatively affected in the future as a result of several factors including low to negative gross margins for polycom s showstation and showstation ip dataconferencing products and viewstation videoconferencing product  inventory value loss related to the showstation inventory if it is determined that the units cannot be sold for at least carrying cost  the reduction in the list prices of the soundstation product line  the introduction of the lower margin soundpoint desktop product line and continuing competitive price pressure in the audioconferencing and dataconferencing markets 
although price reductions have been driven by polycom s desire to expand the market for its products  and polycom expects that in the future it may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to further expand the market or to respond to competitive pricing pressures  there can be no assurance that such actions by polycom will expand the market for its products or be sufficient to meet competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  costs related to the merger with viavideo  and its integration into polycom  expense growth related to the activities of the combined entities and costs related to the introduction of the new showstation ip  viewstation  and soundstation satellite products could negatively impact future profitability 
also  the impacts of pending or future litigation against polycom or viavideo  including the suit filed by vtel against viavideo as mentioned in polycom s form k filed on september  and the suit filed by datapoint  as discussed in polycom s form k filed on january   are difficult to predict at this time 
further  polycom s limited operating history and limited resources  among other factors  make the prediction of future operating results difficult if not impossible 
in the past polycom has experienced delays from time to time in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements and expects that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  the introduction of showstation was delayed by approximately eighteen months from the originally anticipated date of introduction because of unforeseen technical challenges and difficulties in building core technologies and  for approximately nine weeks in the first quarter of  shipments were interrupted in order to correct software and other technical problems identified by initial customers 
in addition  soundstation premier first customer shipments were delayed from its original shipment target of september to november  showstation ip was delayed from september to its targeted first customer shipment date of february  and viewstation was delayed from december to february due to engineering and manufacturing start up issues 
any similar delays could have a material adverse effect on polycom s results of operations 
polycom s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including market acceptance of the next generation of showstation products  the viewstation  and other new product introductions and product enhancements by polycom or its competitors  the prices of polycom s or its competitors products  the mix of products sold  the mix of products sold directly and through resellers  fluctuations in the level of international sales  the cost and availability of components  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  changes in polycom s distribution network  the level of royalties to third parties and changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  competitive pressure on pricing in a given quarter could adversely affect polycom s operating results for such period  and such price pressure over an extended period could materially adversely affect polycom s long term profitability 
polycom s ability to maintain or increase net revenues will depend upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes of its soundstation  soundstation premier and soundpoint families of audioconferencing products and the dataconferencing line of products  currently comprised of the showstation products  its first videoconferencing product  viewstation  and any new products or product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that polycom will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  introduce and sell new products or reduce its costs as a percentage of net revenues 
polycom typically ships products within a short time after receipt of an order  and historically has not had a significant backlog  however  backlog may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
as a result  backlog at any point in time is not a good indicator of future net revenues and net revenues for any particular quarter cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy 
accordingly  polycom s expectations for both short and long term future net revenues are based in large part on its own estimate of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
in addition  polycom has in the past received orders and shipped a substantial percentage of the total products sold during a particular quarter in the last several weeks of the quarter 
in some cases  these orders have consisted of distributor stocking orders and polycom has from time to time provided special incentives for distributors to purchase more than the minimum quantities required under their agreements with polycom 
therefore  polycom has been uncertain  throughout most of each quarter  as to the level of revenues it will achieve in the quarter and the impact that distributor stocking orders will have on revenues and profitability in that quarter and subsequent quarters 
in addition  because a substantial percentage of product sales occur at the end of the quarter  product mix and  therefore  profitability is difficult to predict 
further  there can be no guarantee that polycom s contract manufacturers will be able to meet product demand before a quarter ends 
polycom anticipates that this pattern of sales may continue in the future with the exception that the company may reduce and ultimately eliminate the end of quarter incentives offered to distributors 
if the company chooses to eliminate reduced stocking incentive programs  particularly those associated with audioconferencing sales  quarterly revenue may be materially adversely affected 
expense levels are based  in part  on these estimates and  since polycom is limited in its ability to reduce expenses quickly if orders and net revenues do not meet expectations in a particular period  operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  a seasonal demand may develop for polycom s products in the future 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter polycom s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of polycom s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
polycom has a significant inventory of monochrome showstation products which it plans to sell in latin america over the next several quarters 
there can be no assurance that polycom will be successful in the sale of such products 
the failure to successfully sell such inventory would have a material adverse effect on polycom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for videoconferencing products are characterized by changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of polycom s new videoconferencing products is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of polycom s competitors and market acceptance of these products 
polycom is attempting to address the need to develop new products through its internal development efforts and joint developments with other companies 
there can be no assurance that polycom will successfully identify new videoconferencing product opportunities and develop and bring new videoconferencing products to market in a timely manner  or that videoconferencing products and technologies developed by others will not render polycom s videoconferencing products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of polycom s new videoconferencing products development efforts would have a material adverse effect on polycom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
polycom completed the acquisition the acquisition of viavideo communications inc on january  polycom acquired viavideo with the expectation that the acquisition would result in operating and strategic benefits  including operating cost reductions and product development  marketing and sales synergies 
if the operations of viavideo are not successfully combined with those of polycom in a coordinated  timely and efficient manner  polycom s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely effected 
the integration of viavideo s product offerings and operations with polycom s product offerings and operations and the coordination of viavideo s sales and marketing efforts with those of polycom will require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse affect on polycom s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the difficulties of assimilation may be increased by the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining two different corporate cultures 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of either or both of the companies businesses  which could have an adverse effect on the combined operations 
as a result of the acquisition  polycom s operating expenses will increase in absolute dollars 
should the expected revenues from viavideo products not occur  or occur later or in an amount less than expected  the higher operating expenses could have a material adverse affect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of polycom 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies could have a material adverse effect upon the business  operating results or financial condition of polycom 
additionlly  there can be no assurance that polycom will not incur additional material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the acquisition 
the acquisition could cause customers and potential customers of polycom or viavideo to delay or cancel orders for products as a result of customer concerns and uncertainty over product evolution  integration and support of viavideo s products with polycom s products 
such a delay or cancellation of orders could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of polycom 
polycom and picturetel have entered into agreements whereby picturetel resells polycom s showstation products and supplies polycom s soundpoint products to other producers of videoconferencing products 
polycom does not have any such agreements with picturetel regarding the resale or supply of any of polycom s videoconferencing products 
polycom and picturetel are also competitors in the teleconferencing market and  as such  there can be no assurance that picturetel will enter into future agreements to resell or supply any new or enhanced teleconferencing products 
products under development at viavideo are expected to be more directly competitive with picturetel products  and thus competition between picturetel and polycom is likely to increase  resulting in a strain on the existing relationship between the companies  which could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of polycom 
polycom s operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond polycom s control 
additionally  most of polycom s operations are currently located in the san francisco bay area  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes 
polycom does not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate polycom for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by polycom could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or operating results 
liquidity and capital resources for the three years ended december  as of december   polycom s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
additionally  on october   the company re established a million revolving bank line of credit from silicon valley bank 
this line of credit allows for an additional facility of million available upon request by the company and contingent upon payment of associated fees 
the line of credit facility contains provisions that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and profitability requirements 
as of december   polycom was in compliance with these covenants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
polycom used cash in operating activities totaling million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
the improvement in cash from operating activities was due primarily to improved collections of accounts receivable and larger accounts payable balances  offset somewhat by lower profitability  after considering non cash items such as depreciation  in compared to and a larger increase in other current assets  primarily related to receivables from polycom s contracted manufacturers 
when comparing to  the improvement in cash from operating activities was due to higher profitability  after considering non cash items  and lower increases of inventory  offset by larger increases in accounts receivable and smaller increases in accounts payable 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million proceeds from sales of investments  net of purchases  and net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
the primary uses of cash during were purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and cash used in operating activities of million 
the use of cash in operating activities was the result of higher accounts receivable  due to a larger portion of revenue realized at the end of the year  higher inventory levels and higher other current assets  primarily related to receivables from polycom s contracted manufacturers 
this was offset somewhat by higher accounts payable and a positive net income before considering non cash expenses such as depreciation 
polycom has no material commitments other than obligations under its revolving bank line of credit facility  a sw licensing agreement and operating leases 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
polycom may in the future require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to polycom and would not be dilutive 
polycom s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including introduction of new products and potential product family  technology or outright acquisitions
