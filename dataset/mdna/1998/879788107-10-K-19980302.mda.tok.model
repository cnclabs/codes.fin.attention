quarterly operating results the following tables set forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the eight quarters ended november   together with such data as a percentage of total revenue 
in the opinion of management  this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the information for the periods presented when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results of the full year or of any future quarter

in addition  variations in the company s revenue and operating results occur as a result of a number of other factors  such as employee hiring and utilization rates as well as the number of working days in a quarter 
the timing of revenue is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses  particularly employee compensation  is relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or completion of client engagements  especially at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in quarterly losses

the operating results of many software and business solutions companies reflect seasonal trends  and the company expects to be affected by such trends in the future 
although the company has not experienced consistent seasonal fluctuations in operational results to date  the company believes that it is likely that it will experience relatively higher revenues in the company s fiscal quarters ending on november and relatively lower revenues in its fiscal quarters ending on february as a result of efforts by its direct sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
to the extent future international operations constitute a higher percentage of the company s total revenues  the company anticipates that it may also experience relatively weaker demand in the fiscal quarters ending on august as a result of reduced sales activity in europe during the summer months
