the standard agreement for licensing the company s systems under base fee arrangements contains provisions purporting to limit warranty liability to the correction of any deviation of a system from its specifications 
the company has not incurred any significant warranty expense to date 
the amount of sales returns of hardware and software has been immaterial in the fiscal years ended november   and product development and enhancement the computer software industry is characterized by continual technological change  requiring a high level of expenditures for the development and improvement of computer software products

competition the company believes that its major competition is the in house data processing capability of life insurance companies 
in addition  other independent software producers compete in certain market segments served by the company 
the company believes that its products compete favorably with the competition  although it may be at a competitive disadvantage against companies with greater financial  technological  marketing service and support resources

by virtue of its years of experience in developing software for use by the life insurance industry  the company believes that it has the ability to compete successfully with the data processing systems of life insurance companies and other independent software producers

despite these restrictions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain information which the company regards as its trade secrets 
computer software generally cannot be patented  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection
