additionally  the sale of atc has shifted certain costs from personnel and other operating expenses to commissions 
the addition of nations title inc title premiums  which are primarily agency related  has provided a balance between direct operation and agency revenue 
in previous periods the majority of title premiums and total revenue were generated by direct operations  which resulted in higher personnel costs and other operating expenses

the company monitors its claims experience on a continual basis and adjusts the provision for claim losses accordingly 
based on company loss development studies  the company believes that as a result of its underwriting and claims handling practices  as well as the refinancing business of prior years  the company will maintain the trend of favorable claim loss experience 
based on this information  in  and  the company recorded a provision for claim losses of of title insurance premiums prior to major claim expense  net of recoupments and the impact of premium rates and company loss experience in the state of texas 
premiums are generally higher in texas for similar coverage than in other states  while loss experience is comparable

seasonality 
historically  the greatest volume of residential resale activity has occurred in the spring and summer months 
however  events during the past five years  including numerous actions taken by the federal reserve board  have caused unusual fluctuations in real estate activity  particularly in the seasonal pattern of residential resale and refinance activity 
the company cannot predict whether the historical pattern of residential resale and refinance activity will continue to be affected by such outside factors 
inflation 
to the extent real estate prices or mortgage interest rates increase due to inflationary factors  the company s title insurance premium revenue generally increases because premiums are determined in part by the value of property or the amount of the mortgage loan 
the company s personnel costs and other operating expenses are also sensitive to inflation
