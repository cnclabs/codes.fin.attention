currency exchange rates although the company reports its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately two thirds of its sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily german marks  as well as french francs  italian lire  british pounds and japanese yen 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to united states dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
due to the strengthening of the us dollar against such foreign currencies during fiscal and  the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity changed from a million credit at september  to a million debit at september  the fluctuation of the german mark and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold and gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods
