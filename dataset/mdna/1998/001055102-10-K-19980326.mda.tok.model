foreign currency translation due to the relative size of aflac japan  fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the company s reported results 
exh the following table illustrates the effect of foreign currency translation on the company s reported results by comparing those results as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained unchanged from the previous year 
in years when the yen weakens  translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported 
when the yen strengthens  translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported

operating earnings per diluted share amounts excluding foreign currency changes for each year were determined using the average yen dollar exchange rate for each respective prior year

per share in compared with the strengthening of the yen in benefited operating earnings by 
per share in compared with these per share amounts were solely attributable to the translation effect of the fluctuations in the yen and not to any fundamental change in business operations 
despite the weakening of the yen during and  operating earnings per share increased in each year of the three year period ended december  the increases reflected strong earnings in the functional currencies of aflac s core insurance operations in japan and the united states  a consolidated benefit from additional investment income associated with profit repatriations from aflac japan to aflac us  and in  additional investment income earned on the proceeds from the sale of the television business 
the company s share repurchase program also increased operating earnings per share 
exh the company s primary financial objective is the growth of operating earnings per share before the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
in  the company set this objective at an annual growth rate of to through the year the goal for was growth  which the company exceeded 
excluding the effect of currency fluctuations  operating earnings per share increased in  in and in in early  the company raised its objective for growth in operating earnings per share from a increase to before the effect of currency translation 
if that objective is achieved  the following table shows various results for operating earnings per share in when the estimated impact from foreign currency translation is included 
annual yen average annual operating growth yen impact exchange rate diluted eps over on eps actual average exchange rate profit repatriation aflac japan repatriated profits to aflac us of million in  million in and million in the profit transfer in included million of a non recurring nature related to gains realized from the valuation of investments as determined on a japanese regulatory accounting basis 
since the first repatriation in  aflac japan has repatriated billion  which has enhanced the company s flexibility and profitability 
the profit transfers to aflac us adversely impact aflac japan s investment income 
however  profit repatriations benefit aflac us investment income and consolidated operations because higher investment yields can be obtained on funds invested in the united states 
also  income tax expense is lower on investment income earned in the united states 
management estimates that cumulative profit transfers from through have benefited consolidated net earnings by million in  million in and million in repatriated profits represent a portion of the after tax earnings reported to the japanese ministry of finance as of march each year 
such regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from us generally accepted accounting principles 
such differences relate primarily to the valuation of investments  policy benefit and claim reserves  acquisition costs and deferred income taxes 
japanese regulatory earnings and related profit repatriations may therefore vary materially from year to year because of these differences 
management currently expects that profit repatriation will approximate billion yen million using the december   exchange rate 
exh share repurchase program during  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional million shares of aflac incorporated common stock 
including shares remaining under a previous authorization  the company had approval to purchase up to million shares as of december  the company had purchased million shares from the inception of the share repurchase program in february through december  the shares purchased were financed with bank borrowings and available cash 
interest expense related to the share repurchase program was million in  million in and million in consolidated interest expense  including interest expense from insurance operations  was million in  million in and million in the difference between the percentage increases in net earnings and net earnings per share primarily reflects the impact of the share repurchase program 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rates were in  in and in japanese income taxes on aflac japan s operating results  which were taxed at japan s corporate income tax rate of  accounted for most of the company s income tax expense 
the decline in the effective tax rates in and resulted primarily from increased earnings from the company s us business segment  which included the gains from the sale of the television business in and insurance operations  aflac japan aflac japan  a branch of aflac and the principal contributor to the company s earnings  ranks number one in terms of premium income and profits among all foreign life and non life insurance companies operating in japan 
aflac was ranked number one in financial strength among japan s major life insurers in nikkei business magazine 
among all life insurance companies operating in japan  aflac japan ranks fourth in terms of individual policies in force and th in terms of assets 
the transfer of profits from aflac japan to aflac us distorts comparisons of operating results between years 
therefore  the aflac japan summary of operations table on the following page presents investment income  total revenues and pretax operating earnings calculated on a pro forma basis in order to improve comparability between years

exh japanese economy since the last half of  there has been widespread concern regarding the economic outlook of many asian countries  including japan 
the financial strength of some japanese financial institutions has deteriorated  and others have experienced bankruptcy 
some experts believe japan s economy could weaken further 
as management has indicated in the past  the weak economy in japan has resulted in a difficult marketing environment for aflac japan  declining interest rates for new money investments and decreased consumer confidence 
the time required for the japanese economy to recover remains uncertain 
aflac japan sales the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of in  in and in reflect the high persistency of aflac japan s business and sales of new policies 
annualized premiums in force were billion yen billion at december   billion yen billion at december   and billion yen billion at december  new annualized premiums from sales were million in  down down in yen  million in  down up in yen  and million in  up up in yen 
aflac japan s sales mix is changing  although cancer life still accounts for the majority of insurance in force 
cancer life sales accounted for of total new sales in yen in  in and in living benefit life  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  accounted for of total new sales in and in care product sales represented of total new sales in  in and in aflac japan s new policy sales in were affected by a lingering weak economy and a series of premium rate increases that aflac and the insurance industry have implemented since  including the most recent one in the fourth quarter of additionally  consumer confidence in the life insurance industry declined following the april collapse of nissan mutual life insurance company 
management has taken several actions to help mitigate the impact of the weak sales environment in japan 
first  a new economy cancer life policy was introduced in january this new plan has lower premium rates and benefit levels and was developed to combat the impact of increased premium rates for new issues 
in addition  the company has increased the use of direct mail marketing for its products as a supplemental distribution method and will continue its popular television advertising program 
the incentive pay system for aflac japan s employed sales managers was revised to reward them for improved sales performance 
the company made additional expenditures in the second half of that will continue in for expanded sales promotion efforts in japan 
in december  aflac japan received approval from japanese regulators to sell three new riders to the company s popular cancer life policy 
one rider adds cancer surgical benefits  while another provides supplemental accident coverage 
the third rider provides supplemental medical benefits for general hospitalization 
in september  the exh japanese government increased the copayments for the employer sponsored health care program from to for the primary insured  thereby increasing the portion of the costs the insured must pay 
given the increase in copayments  the company believes the medical benefits should be especially appealing to consumers 
during  aflac japan will primarily market the accident and medical riders in a single affordable package that should be attractive in the current economy 
in  the company expects to increase sales by to compared with and maintain the profit margin at approximately the level 
management also expects revenues in yen to increase and the company s strong policy persistency to continue 
aflac japan investments due to the continued low level of available investment yields in japan  the ministry of finance has directed insurers to increase premium rates on new policy issues in recent years 
aflac japan increased premium rates by an average of on all cancer life policy sales made after july  premium rates on new care policy issues were increased by an average of in november and an additional in september as a result of continuing low yields  the company increased premium rates by approximately on new policy issues for all product lines beginning in the fourth quarter of investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations  investment yields achievable on new investments and foreign currency exchange rates 
investment income in dollars in and was affected by the weaker yen 
despite a general decline in available investment yields  investment income in yen increased in and in funds available for investment during the three year period through were reduced by the annual profit repatriations previously discussed 
rates of return on fixed maturity securities in japan remained low in compared with historical levels 
for instance  the yield on year japanese government bonds  as measured by a composite index  declined from a high of in may to a low of in november  closing the year at 
aflac japan s new money rates for investments were for  for and for the improvement in aflac japan s new money yield in resulted from restructuring portions of the existing dollar denominated investment portfolio and a greater allocation of cash flow to private placement securities  which included dual currency securities yen denominated bonds with a dollar coupon 
the cumulative effect of lower investment yields is reflected in the overall rate of return net of investment expenses on aflac japan s average investments and cash  at amortized cost 
this return was in  compared with in and in by concentrating on selected sectors of the bond market  aflac japan has secured higher yields than year japanese government bonds would have provided while still adhering to conservative standards for credit quality 
management believes that it can invest new money in the near term at an adequate spread over premium pricing assumptions for new business and assumed interest rates for policy liabilities 
the premium increases implemented during the past three years will have a positive impact on investment margins and therefore should contribute to stability in the pretax operating profit margin 
exh insurance deregulation in december  the governments of the united states and japan reached an agreement on deregulation of the japanese insurance industry 
the agreement calls for the gradual liberalization of the industry through the year and includes provisions to avoid radical change in the third sector of the insurance industry  which includes supplemental insurance 
aflac and other foreign owned insurers  as well as some small to medium sized japanese insurers  operate primarily in the third sector 
one of the measures for avoiding radical change in the third sector is the prohibition of additional japanese life and non life insurance companies from selling cancer or medical insurance until january  although the company has inherent competitive strengths in distribution  products and investments that should enable the support of business expansion in a more competitive environment  the ultimate impact of deregulation is not presently determinable 
aflac japan other during the three year period ended december   the benefit ratio and the operating expense ratio were relatively stable 
the decline of the benefit ratio in is primarily attributable to newer products that have somewhat lower loss ratios than the cancer life plan 
annual claims experience and persistency studies continue to support the current reserving assumptions 
during the second quarter of  nissan mutual life insurance company  a medium sized japanese insurer  was declared insolvent by the japanese ministry of finance 
previously  all life insurers doing business in japan had agreed to contribute to a voluntary policyholder protection fund that would be used to help offset insurer insolvencies 
the total assessment was allocated among the life insurance companies based on relative company size 
during the second quarter of  aflac japan recognized a pretax charge of billion yen million for this policyholder protection fund 
the after tax amount was million  or 
per share for both basic and diluted earnings per share 
without this charge  the expense ratio would have decreased from to in the japanese government increased the consumption tax from to effective april  aflac japan currently incurs consumption tax on most of the commissions paid to its agents 
the company implemented changes in compensation arrangements with its agents to mitigate a portion of this tax increase 
the consumption tax increase had no material affect on consolidated net earnings 
in march  the japanese government ratified new income tax provisions that increase income taxes on investment income received by foreign companies operating in japan from securities issued from their home country 
the new provisions are effective beginning in management has mitigated some of the tax impact through investment alternatives and by restructuring portions of the existing investment portfolio 
management estimates the net impact of this tax change will decrease net earnings by million 
most of the company s income tax expense represents japanese income taxes on aflac japan s operating results calculated at the japanese corporate tax rate of 
in december  japanese government leaders exh announced proposals to stimulate the japanese economy 
if enacted as presently proposed  the japanese corporate tax rate would be reduced beginning in the proposals also include tax base broadening provisions whereby certain accrued expenses would no longer be deductible for tax purposes until paid 
discussions continue among government leaders  and these corporate tax changes are expected to be finalized in march even with japan s economic slowdown  the company believes the market for supplemental insurance remains bright 
need for the company s products in japan has continued  and the company remains optimistic about increasing penetration within existing groups  selling new products  opening new accounts and developing additional supplemental products for the japanese market 
insurance operations  aflac us aflac us pretax operating earnings continued to benefit from additional investment income earned on profit transfers received from aflac japan 
estimated investment income earned from profits repatriated to and retained by aflac us from through  along with estimated investment income earned from the sales proceeds of the television business  have been reclassified in the presentation on the following page in order to improve comparability between years

the increases in annualized premiums in force of in  in and in were favorably affected by increased exh sales at the work site through cafeteria plans internal revenue code section and an improvement in the persistency for several lines of business 
annualized premiums in force were billion at december   billion at december   and million at december  new annualized premiums from sales and policy conversions were million in  up  million in  up  and million in  up 
accident disability coverage was the best selling product for the fourth year in a row  while sales of cancer coverage remained strong  up in aflac us other management expects the operating expense ratio  excluding discretionary advertising expenses  to decline in the future due to continued improvements in operating efficiencies 
the company has developed a laptop  point of sale computer system that allows sales associates to input the customer s information  capture the signature  and electronically transmit the application from the field to headquarters in a completely paperless transaction 
at year end  approximately of new business was transmitted via this laptop compared with about in by improving administrative systems and controlling other costs  management has been able to redirect funds to a national advertising program without significantly affecting the pretax operating profit margin 
for more information regarding advertising expenses  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results reflect slightly higher benefit ratios due to the company s ongoing efforts to improve policy persistency by enhancing policyholder benefits 
in addition  potential minimum benefit ratio requirements by insurance regulators may also result in an increase to these ratios 
however  the aggregate benefit ratio has been relatively stable due to the mix of business shifting towards accident and hospital indemnity policies  which have lower benefit ratios than other products 
management expects the pretax operating profit margin  which was excluding investment earnings from profit repatriation and from the broadcast sale in  to remain approximately the same or increase slightly in management continues to believe that there are significant opportunities to market high quality  affordable supplemental insurance products in the us marketplace 
other operations the parent company s operating expenses consist primarily of corporate overhead expenses such as salary costs  retirement provisions  professional fees and litigation expenses 
these expenses have fluctuated in recent years due to changes in the legal environment in certain states and to enhanced benefits  early retirements and revisions in actuarial assumptions for retirement accruals 
exh on march   the company sold its canadian insurance subsidiary at a nominal gain 
other operations include an insurance operation in taiwan

analysis of financial condition balance sheet during the last two years  the financial condition of the company has remained strong in the functional currencies of its operations 
the investment portfolios of aflac japan and aflac us have continued to grow and consist of high quality securities 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to convert yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one us dollar  weaker than the december   exchange rate of 
management estimates that the weaker yen rate decreased reported investments and cash by billion  total assets by billion and total liabilities by billion compared with the amounts that would have been reported for if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from year end for additional information on exchange rates  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market risks of financial instruments the company is exposed primarily to three types of market risks on its financial instruments 
these are interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk the primary interest rate exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the company s investments in fixed maturity securities 
the company uses modified duration analysis to estimate the amount of sensitivity to interest rate changes in its fixed maturity securities 
modified duration analysis provides a measure of price percentage volatility 
for example  if the current duration of a bond is five  then the market value of the bond will increase by approximately if market interest rates decrease by basis points 
likewise  the value of the bond will decrease by approximately if market interest rates increase by basis points 
exh the following table shows the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair values of the company s fixed maturity securities and notes payable 
sensitivity of fair values of financial instruments to interest rate changes december  market basis basis basis value basis basis basis in millions points points points points points points fixed maturity securities yen denominated        dollar denominated        total        notes payable excludes capitalized leases 
the unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities  less amounts applicable to policy liabilities and deferred income taxes  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the portion of unrealized gains credited to policy liabilities represents gains that would not inure to the benefit of the shareholders if such gains were actually realized 
for further information  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company attempts to match the duration of its assets with the duration of its liabilities 
for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefit liabilities is longer than that of the related assets due to the unavailability of qualified long duration securities 
therefore  there is a risk that reinvestment of the proceeds at maturity of such investments will be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy liabilities 
at december   the average duration of the policy liabilities was approximately years  unchanged from the average duration of the yen denominated invested assets was approximately nine years in and over the next five years  billion  at amortized cost  or  of aflac japan s yen denominated fixed maturity securities are scheduled to mature 
the following is a comparison of the actuarially assumed interest rates for policy reserves and investment yields for us japan policies issued in required interest on policy reserves investment portfolio new money yield all policies in force at december  required interest on policy reserves investment portfolio yield exh the company has outstanding interest rate swaps on all of its variable interest rate yen denominated borrowings 
these swaps reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s borrowing costs and effectively change the company s interest rate from variable to fixed 
therefore  there was no effect on net earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
for further information on the company s notes payable  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
equity price risk equity securities at december   totaled million  or 
of total investments and cash on a consolidated basis 
the company uses beta analysis to measure the sensitivity of its equity securities portfolio to fluctuations in the broad market 
the beta of the company s equity securities portfolio is 
for example  if the overall stock market value changed by  the value of aflac s equity securities would be expected to change by approximately  or million 
currency risk most of aflac japan s investments and cash are denominated in yen 
when the yen denominated financial instruments mature or are sold  the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities and are held to fund yen denominated policy obligations rather than converted into dollars 
therefore  there is no significant economic or foreign currency transaction risk 
in addition to the yen denominated financial instruments held by aflac japan  the parent company has yen denominated borrowings that have been designated as a hedge of the company s investment in aflac japan 
the unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the company attempts to match its yen denominated assets to its yen denominated liabilities on a consolidated basis in order to minimize the exposure of its shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations

exh aflac invests primarily within the japanese  us and euroyen fixed maturity markets 
the company uses specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of its investments and utilizes a variety of credit rating services to monitor these criteria 
applying those various credit ratings to a standardized rating system based on a nationally recognized service s categories  the percentages of the company s fixed maturity securities available for sale  at amortized cost  as of december were as follows aaa aa a bbb the company does not hold any securities rated below bbb

aflac japan has made investments in the private placement market to secure higher yields than those available from japanese government bonds 
at the same time  the company has adhered to its conservative standards for credit quality 
the company s purchases in the private placement market are often done through euro medium term note programs 
securities in these programs are more marketable due to standardized documentation and relatively wide distribution

the borrowing limit is million 
at december   bank borrowings of billion yen million were outstanding under this agreement 
the proceeds from these loans were used to fund the company s share repurchase program 
when any portion of these loans is denominated in yen  the principal amounts of the loans in dollars will fluctuate due to changes in the yen dollar exchange rate 
the company intends to service these loans with yen denominated funds received as profit repatriations from aflac japan 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps that effectively change the company s interest rate on these loans from variable to fixed 
the variable rate on the billion yen million loan is  and the fixed rate is after the effect of the swaps including loan costs of basis points 
the variable rate on the billion yen million loan is  and the fixed rate is after the effect of the swaps including loan costs of basis points

policy guaranty funds under insurance guaranty fund laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to the company in the past 
the company believes that future assessments relating to companies in the us currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the life insurance association of japan  an industry organization  implemented a policyholder protection fund in to provide capital support to insolvent life insurers 
aflac japan has pledged investment securities to the life insurance association of japan for this program 
the company retains ownership of the securities and receives the related investment income 
the amount of securities pledged was based on relative company size 
as of december   million  at fair value  of aflac japan s investment securities had been pledged to this fund  of which approximately million will be used in future years for assessment payments for the insolvency of nissan mutual life 
the fund was depleted by this insolvency  and the japanese government may require additional contributions in the future 
the japanese ministry of finance and the life insurance association of japan are discussing a permanent policyholder protection fund system that will cover of the reserves of any failed company 
the contributions to this system will also be based on relative company size 
this new fund is not expected to be established until april shareholders equity shareholders equity increased billion from december   to december  this was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of billion  net earnings of million and an increase in unrealized foreign currency exchange gains of million 
offsetting these increases were net treasury stock purchases of million and dividends to shareholders of million 
the company s insurance operations continue to provide its primary sources of liquidity 
capital needs can also be supplemented by borrowed funds 
the principal sources of cash from insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
primary uses of cash in the insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and exh uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
the company s investment objectives provide for liquidity through the ownership of high quality investment securities 
aflac insurance policies are generally not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of aflac policies provide indemnity benefits rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and therefore are not subject to the risks of medical cost inflation 
the achievement of continued long term growth will require growth in aflac s statutory capital and surplus 
aflac may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
the recent disposition of the broadcast business has increased the company s capital resources 
management believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available for capital expenditures  business expansion and funding the company s share repurchase program 
parent company capital resources are largely dependent upon the ability of the subsidiaries to pay management fees and dividends 
the georgia insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to the parent company 
the georgia insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of statutory earnings for the previous year or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the georgia insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  as modified by the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from generally accepted accounting principles and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic is in the process of recodifying sap to promote standardization throughout the industry 
completion of this project will result in many changes to sap

however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company depends will be completed on a timely basis
