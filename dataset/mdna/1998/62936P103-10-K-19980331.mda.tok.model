item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of nps should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview since its inception in  nps has devoted substantially all of its resources to its research and development programs 
to date  the company has not completed development of any pharmaceutical product for sale and has incurred substantial losses 
nps has incurred cumulative losses through december  of million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of million 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as the company continues and expands its research and development and preclinical and clinical testing activities 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from license fees  milestone payments and research and development support payments from its licensees and these revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  the company expects that income or loss will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  that such fluctuations may be substantial  and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results 
the company s ability to achieve profitability depends in part on its ability  alone and or with others and the efforts of its licensees  to complete development of its products  to obtain the required regulatory approvals and to manufacture and market such products  as to which matters there can be no assurance 
results of operations substantially all of the company s revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were derived from research and license agreements 
the company recognized million in  million in and million in under the terms of its agreement with smithkline beecham  million in  million in  and million in under the terms of its agreement with kirin  and million in and  in under the terms of its agreement with amgen 
these revenues were derived from a combination of one time license fees  milestone payments and research and development support payments and are not indicative of future revenue that may be earned under these agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of payments that may be received by the company in the future under these agreements 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in and million in the increases in research and development expenses were principally due to the conduct of increasingly expensive clinical trials for r in and early  the preclinical development of nps in and early  the conduct of clinical trials for nps commencing in mid and increased personnel costs throughout the three years 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in the future as nps conducts discovery  preclinical development and clinical trials for non licensed product candidates  sponsors research or obtains licenses for technology  product candidates or products from private commercial entities  academia or research institutions and hires more research and development personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and million in the increases were primarily due to hiring of additional personnel in the areas of business development  investor relations and legal affairs in and costs associated with a follow on offering of the company s common stock which was completed in may the company expects that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as more personnel and facilities are needed to support research and development activities 
interest income increased from  in to million in and million in primarily due to a higher average cash balance resulting from the net proceeds of the follow on offering of common stock in may the company anticipates that interest income will decrease in the future as the company s cash is utilized for operations 
income tax expense of  in   in and  in resulted from a japanese tax withheld on the license fee and milestone payments by kirin  and us alternative minimum tax of  incurred on net income in and paid in future milestone and royalty payments from kirin will be subject to the same tax 
as of december   the company had a federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
the company s ability to utilize these operating loss and research credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of equity securities 
as of december   the company had recognized million of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements and million in consideration for the sale of equity securities for cash and services 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities which totaled million at december  the company receives quarterly research and or development support payments under its agreements with amgen  kirin and smithkline beecham 
such payments are scheduled to aggregate million through the scheduled expiration dates of the agreements in december  june and october  respectively 
in addition  smithkline beecham will purchase  shares of nps common stock at a premium to the market price if the research agreement is not terminated early 
the company could receive future payments of up to million in the aggregate from amgen  kirin  and smithkline beecham upon the accomplishment of specified research and or development milestones under the respective agreements 
nps does not control the subject matter  timing or resources applied by its licensees under their respective development programs 
thus  the company s potential receipt of milestone payments from these licensees is largely beyond the control of nps 
progress under these agreements is subject to risk and each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee 
no assurance can be given that any future milestone or research or development support payments will be received from any of them or under any other licensing agreement then in effect 
the company has entered into certain sponsored research and license agreements that obligate the company to make research support payments to academic and or commercial research institutions 
additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions  or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
as of december   the company had a total commitment of approximately million for future research support payments 
the company expects to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
as of december   the company s investment in leasehold improvements  equipment and furnishings was million  net of depreciation 
the company has financed a portion of such expenditures through capital leases and long term debt with a total principal obligation of  as of december   of which  is classified as short term 
additional equipment and facilities will be needed as the company increases its research and development activities  a portion of which may be financed with debt or leases 
equipment and leasehold improvements subject to the capital leases and long term debt have been pledged in support of such obligations 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including interest earned thereon and expected research and development support payments and equity purchases from its licensees  will be sufficient to enable it to maintain its current and planned operations for at least months 
however  actual needs are dependent on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s current and future research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing research and license arrangements  the establishment of additional license arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up and development of marketing activities  if undertaken by the company 
furthermore  in the event the company were to in license or otherwise acquire a product candidate in clinical development  substantial expenditures for clinical trials and regulatory submissions would be required 
substantial expenditures will be required to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacture or have manufactured and market any proprietary products of nps that may be derived from current research and development efforts and perform research and development activities in additional areas 
in addition  if any licensee terminates its agreement  the company may not have sufficient capital to complete the development and commercialization of a product in the respective territory 
a reduction in the expected amount of research and development support payments or equity purchases may shorten the period during which the company could maintain its operations or require the company to reduce its operations 
nps may need to raise additional funds to support its long term product development and commercialization programs 
the company is presently seeking additional funding for certain of its current programs through corporate collaborations and licensing agreements 
the company may also seek additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research and development programs or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own 
year assessment the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the year on its operations and systems 
management has developed assessment procedures and a plan to address identified issues within the company 
the company does not yet know the extent  if any  of the impact of the year on its systems and equipment 
there can be no assurance that third parties  such as suppliers  clinical research organizations and collaborative parties  are using systems that are year compliant or will address any year issues in a timely fashion 
any year compliance problems of either the company  its suppliers  its clinical research organizations  or its collaborative partners could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial conditions 
certain business risks the company is currently in the early stage of product development 
nps and compounds for the treatment of hpt are the only product candidates under development by the company or its licensees that are in human clinical trials 
there is no guarantee that nps or any compound for hpt will prove to be safe or effective or that back up or later generation compounds will be identified or taken into clinical trials or if so identified and so tested  that such compounds will be found to be safe  effective or marketable 
all of the company s remaining technologies are in preclinical stages and will require significant additional research and development efforts prior to any commercial use 
because the company has granted exclusive development  commercialization and marketing rights in the fields of hpt and osteoporosis  the success of its existing hpt and osteoporosis programs is primarily dependent upon the efforts of amgen  kirin and smithkline beecham 
other risks include the company s lack of product sales  a history of operating losses  the uncertainty of regulatory approvals  rapid technological change and competition  the uncertainty of protection of the company s patents and proprietary technology  the company s dependence on third parties for manufacturing  the company s future capital needs and the uncertainty of additional funding  the company s lack of marketing capabilities  the uncertainty of third party reimbursement  the uncertainty of the company s in licensing efforts  the company s dependence on key personnel and the company s ability to manage growth
