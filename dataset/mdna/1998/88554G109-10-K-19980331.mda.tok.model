item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company  the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company is a knowledge based oil and gas exploration company whose core competence and strategic focus is the utilization of d imaging and other advanced technologies in the search for commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
the company enters into arrangements that enable it to combine its expertise and exploration capabilities with the operating skills of other oil and gas companies 
the company participates in selected exploration projects as a non operating working interest owner  sharing both risks and rewards with its partners 
the company commenced operations in january to take advantage of perceived opportunities emerging from changes in the domestic oil and gas industry  including the divestiture of domestic oil and gas properties  advances in technology and the outsourcing of specialized technical capabilities 
by reducing drilling risk through d imaging and analysis  the company seeks to improve the expected return on investment in its oil and gas projects 
as a working interest partner  the company shares all project costs in proportion to its working interest percentage 
in instances in which exploration and development activities are unsuccessful  the company incurs an economic loss equal to its proportionate share of project costs prior to the time the project is abandoned 
similarly  the company incurs economic loss if the company s proportionate share of revenue generated from production is insufficient to cover the company s share of project costs 
the company s future financial results will depend primarily on i the company s ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  ii the company s ability to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons  iii the market price for oil and gas  and iv the company s ability to fully implement its exploration and development program  which is dependent on the availability of capital resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in any of these respects  that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production  or that the company will be able to obtain additional funding to increase its currently limited capital resources 
the company recorded a valuation allowance against the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
the company reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments  as necessary  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december   the company had tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million which begin to expire in as a result of the recent stock transactions  including the initial public offering  there is a yearly limitation placed on the company s utilization of its nol s under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended

results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information of the company during the periods indicated year ended december  production gas mmcf  oil and condensate mbbls total equivalent  converted at mmcfe  average sales price gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl average expenses per mcfe lease operating depletion of oil and gas properties includes all lease operating expenses and taxes attributable to the company s properties  including production and ad valorem taxes 
oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues increased to  for the year ended december  the period from  for the year ended december  the period 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher oil and gas production levels 
production increased by over to  mmcfe for the period  from mmcfe for the period 
the increased production resulted from successful wells drilled during the last three months of and throughout the year in the number of productive wells in which the company owned an interest increased to net at the end for the period from net at the end of the period 
the average sales price for natural gas  which accounted for of equivalent production during the period  decreased by to per mcf from per mcf for the period 
the average sales price for oil decreased to during the period versus per barrel for the period 
oil and gas revenues increased to  for the period from  for the period 
this increase was attributable to both higher oil and gas production levels and a significant increase in the average price for both natural gas and oil 
production increased by over to mmcfe for the period  from mmcfe for the period 
the increased production resulted from successful wells drilled during the last six months of and throughout the year in the average sales price for natural gas  which accounted for of equivalent production during the period  increased by to per mcf for the period from per mcf for the period 
the average sales price for oil increased to during the period versus for the period 
lease operating expenses 
total lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased to  for the period from  for the period 
this increase was primarily attributable to the additional costs of operating new producing wells drilled during the last three months of and throughout the year in and is comparable to the increase in production during the corresponding periods 
lease operating expenses per mcfe of production increased slightly to per mcfe for the period from per mcfe for the period 
total lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased to  for the period from  for the period 
lease operating expenses per mcfe decreased to for the period from per mcfe for the period 
substantially all of this decrease in lease operating expenses per mcfe was the result of lower lease operating expenses per mcfe for certain wells completed during the period 
these wells were producing at relatively high rates from onshore  shallow  highly permeable gas sands and produce relatively small amounts of water  so there are negligible treating or disposal costs associated with such wells 
these wells require no artificial lift or compression so the power and maintenance costs associated with such wells are minimal 
additionally  the highly permeable nature of the producing zones resulted in relatively high production rates  which lowered the operating expenses associated with production from these wells on a per mcfe basis 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense 
depletion of oil and gas properties for the period increased to  from  for the period 
the increase in depletion of oil and gas properties resulted from both the increase in oil and gas production during the period  as discussed above  and an increase in the depletion rate for this period 
depletion of oil and gas properties per mcfe for the period increased to per mcfe  or  from the rate of per mcfe in the corresponding period in the increase in the rate resulted from greater additions to evaluated oil and gas property costs than the additions to oil and gas reserves relative to the existing depletion rate per mcfe 
this was principally the result of the costs of unsuccessful wells drilled in depletion of oil and gas properties for the period increased to  from  for the period 
the increase in depletion of oil and gas properties resulted from both the increase in oil and gas production during the period and a increase in the depletion rate 
depletion of oil and gas properties per mcfe for the period increased to per mcfe over the rate of per mcfe in the corresponding period in the increase in the rate resulted from greater additions to evaluated oil and gas property costs than the additions to oil and gas reserves relative to the existing depletion rate per mcfe 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
under the rules of the full cost accounting method as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  the company is required to compare the net costs of its evaluated properties to the net present value of its proved reserves  using prices and costs in effect at the end of each quarterly period 
if such evaluated costs  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization exceed the present value of proved reserves  an impairment charge is required to writedown those excess costs 
oil and gas impairment charges recorded during were  all of which were attributable to the fourth quarter ended december  this writedown results principally from three factors the significant decline in oil and gas prices being received by the company on december  as compared to september   a relatively large investment in three unsuccessful exploratory wells all of which were evaluated in fourth quarter of  and a conservative estimate of proved reserves on a potentially significant discovery on the ramrod prospect  as discussed in item  properties 
impairments recorded during and totaled  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the evaluated costs of prospects which had poor drilling results during those periods 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense  net of costs capitalized to exploration and development projects  increased to  for the period from  for the period 
the increase is primarily a result of personnel costs associated with hiring which occurred during and increased professional fees and other costs associated with being a public company offset by a decrease in the amount of  relating to the amortization of deferred compensation expense 
the amount represented a increase from  incurred during the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of deferred compensation expense recognized in connection with stock options granted within one year of the filing of the registration statement for the initial public offering  which expense is based on the difference between the option price and the initial per share initial public offering price of the common stock 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to approximately  for the period from approximately  for the comparable period during this increase reflects interest income on the higher level of short term investments during as a result of investment of the proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
the amount represents a increase from  earned during the comparable period  as a result of interest income attributable to short term investment of the proceeds of the series c preferred stock 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net loss increased to approximately million for the period from approximately million for the period 
the most significant factor which caused the increase in net loss was the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded under full cost accounting rules 
the net loss for increased slightly from the net loss of million in  as a result of all of the foregoing 
liquidity and capital resources to date  net cash provided by operating activities has been limited and the company has funded its oil and gas exploration activities principally through cash provided by the sale of equity securities 
on december   the company consummated an initial public offering of common stock which provided approximately million in proceeds  net of offering expenses 
in january  the company s underwriters exercised their over allotment option to purchase  additional shares of common stock  resulting in additional net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
approximately million of the proceeds of the initial public offering was used to redeem all the issued and outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock and to pay accrued dividends on the issued and outstanding series c preferred stock 
the balance of the net proceeds were designated to fund the company s exploration and development capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including expenses associated with hiring additional personnel 
the company s business requires substantial oil and gas capital expenditures 
to achieve its near term goals  the company has been and will be required to make oil and gas capital expenditures substantially in excess of its net cash flow from operations in order to acquire  explore and develop oil and gas properties 
capital expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development activities during the years ended december    and  were million  million and million  respectively 
the company has not set a final capital expenditure budget for  but has opportunities to invest in excess of million in exploration and development projects in which the company currently owns an interest 
the company continues to define new opportunities on both its active exploration projects and new projects 
however  the level of capital spending in is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain additional sources of funding 
as of december   the company had a deficit in working capital of approximately  on december   the company executed a credit agreement with a commercial bank 
the credit agreement provided borrowing capacity of million at december  such borrowing capacity is a function of the value of the company s proved oil and gas reserves  and is redetermined on a quarterly basis 
the bank is currently conducting a schedule redetermination 
based of preliminary indications from the bank  the company expects the revised borrowing base to be between and million 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties and contains restrictions on dividends and additional liens and indebtedness and requires the maintenance of a minimum current ratio and net worth  each as defined in the credit agreement 
there were no borrowings under the credit agreement during the company prefers to use debt only to fund development drilling and not to finance exploration costs 
however  the company expects to use funds available under the credit agreement as a source of financing to fund both exploration and development activities until additional equity or other sources of permanent funding are obtained 
as a result of the company s periodic review of each of its oil and gas exploration and development properties and its available capital  the company has on two occasions sold partial interests in specific oil and gas projects to other investors to reduce its total investment commitment to such projects 
no gain or loss was recognized on either transaction 
the company is currently reviewing its portfolio and has identified one property in which it intends to sell the majority of its interests to provide additional capital for its exploration program 
such interests consist of both producing wells and future drilling locations 
the company may identify additional properties for sale in the course of its continuing review 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to sell any such interests  or that the terms of such sale will be acceptable to the company 
the company expects that its projected cash flows from currently producing properties will be sufficient to fund its cash general and administrative costs for the next twelve months  including technical employee and related costs which are capitalized under full cost accounting  and will also provide limited funding for its capital program 
the company s projections of cash flows from currently producing properties are dependent on the following assumptions i there are no significant declines in oil and gas prices below current levels or anticipated seasonal lows  and ii there are no significant declines in oil and gas production from existing properties other than declines in production currently anticipated based on engineering estimates of the decline curves associated with such properties 
to enable it to continue to take advantage of oil and gas exploration and development opportunities  the company intends to seek additional financing in to satisfy its capital requirements 
the company is currently evaluating alternatives to obtain additional equity financing  which include sales of common or preferred stock 
the company anticipates funding its short term capital spending from a combination of expected cash flow generated from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties 
in the absence of additional financing  the company could be required to modify the implementation and timing of its oil and gas exploration and development capital spending for  which modification could have a material adverse effect on the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms which would be acceptable to the company  if at all 
effects of inflation and changes in price the company s results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and gas prices 
if the price of oil and gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in the operating cost that the company is required to bear for operations  as well as an increase decrease in revenues 
historically  general price inflation has had a minimal effect on the company 
other in connection with stock options granted within one year prior to the initial filing of the registration statement relating to the initial public offering  the company recorded deferred compensation expense based on the difference between the option exercise price and the fair value of the company s common stock at the date of grant  using the per share initial public offering price as an estimate of the fair value 
such deferred compensation is being amortized as additional compensation expense over the vesting period for the options 
as of december   the company had unamortized deferred compensation of  which will be charged to expense during the next three years 
the company has elected not to adopt the fair value accounting of sfas no 
for employees and continues to account for these plans under apb opinion no 
the company has assessed the expected impact of the date change in the year on the software programs used in its operations 
the majority of the company s technical applications are not date sensitive 
the applications that do have date sensitive aspects  including the company s accounting software  have either been updated to compensate for the date change in the year or are currently being updated by the software vendors 
based on this assessment  the company does not expect to have any significant operational issues or material costs related to the year software issue
