overview optika is a leading provider of high performance  client server  integrated imaging software designed to meet the needs of paper intensive industries such as healthcare  financial services  insurance  and large retail organizations 
the license of the company s software products is typically an executive level decision by prospective end users and generally requires the company and its bsps or oems to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle typically between six and twelve months from the initial contact date 
the company distributes its products through a worldwide network of approximately bsps and oems 
for  approximately of the company s license revenues were derived from its bsps and approximately of its license revenues were derived from sales by oems 
in  the company s top bsps accounted for approximately of its license revenues 
however  no individual bsp accounted for more than of the company s total revenues 
for the years ended december   and  the company generated approximately  and  respectively  of its total revenues from international sales 
the company s revenues consist primarily of license revenues  which are comprised of one time fees for the license of the company s products  and maintenance revenues  which are comprised of fees for upgrades and technical support 
the bsps and oems  which are responsible for the installation and integration of the software  enter into sales agreements with the end user  and purchase software directly from the company 
the software is licensed directly to the end user by the company through a standard shrink wrapped license agreement 
annual maintenance agreements are also entered into between the bsps and oems and the end user  and the bsps and oems then purchase maintenance services directly from the company 
for and  approximately and  respectively of the company s total revenues were derived from software licenses and approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were derived from maintenance agreements 
other revenues  which are comprised of training  consulting and implementation services  and third party hardware and software products  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
license revenues are generally recognized upon shipment when no significant vendor obligations remain and collectibility is probable 
license revenues related to contracts with significant post delivery performance obligations are recognized when the company s obligations are no longer significant or when the customer accepts the product  as applicable 
maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally one year 
other revenues are recognized as services are performed 
based on the company s research and development process  costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and general release of the software products have not been material and therefore have not been capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company generally does not grant rights to return products  except for defects in the performance of the products relative to specifications  and pursuant to standard industry shrink wrapped license agreements  which provide for day rights of return if an end user does not accept the terms of the software license  nor does it provide provisions for price adjustments or rotation rights 
however  if other rights of return are granted  revenue recognition is deferred until such rights lapse 
the company s terms of sales generally range from to days from date of shipment for bsps and oems 
during the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to exit the vertical healthcare market and sold the rights to the majority of the software products that previously comprised the fphealthcare suite of products 
the fphealthcare suite was being developed to offer a product tailored to the healthcare industry however  there have been a limited number of customers who have licensed the software 
the restructuring plan involved the fphealthcare suite product sale  closure of the company s boston facility  and the termination of approximately employees 
the company anticipates a reduction in operating expenses of approximately million per year due to the exiting of this business and an insignificant reduction in revenues from the healthcare products 
software companies who are in the process of announcing and releasing new versions or products frequently experience an adverse effect on revenue during the period between the date the new release is announced and when it becomes generally available 
this negative effect is a result of customer s buying patterns whereby they have a tendency to wait until the new version is generally available to actually make a purchase 
the company expects that it will experience this adverse effect until optika emedia  which was recently announced  is available 
further  if customers purchasing current products are granted discounts or upgrade rights to future releases  significant amounts of revenue may be deferred from sales of currently shipped products because of the company s adoption of the recently released sop software revenue recognition 
the effect of these two potential adverse factors coupled with anticipated significant research and development spending will likely result in operating losses being incurred in several of the quarters of results of operations comparison of years ended december  to december  revenues total revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  licenses
