item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general sitel was founded in by its current chairman  james f 
lynch  in omaha  nebraska 
sitel completed its initial public offering of common stock in  and was the first major independent publicly held company in the teleservices industry 
in  the company began its international expansion with acquisitions in canada and spain which also included operations in portugal and  in particular  with the merger with mitre plc mitre or the mitre merger which was completed in september at the time of the mitre merger  mitre had operations in the united kingdom  belgium and japan and was in the final stages of completing plans to enter singapore  hong kong and germany 
in  sitel entered australia  new zealand  sweden and ireland through acquisitions  entered mexico and colombia through the joint venture with corporacion interamericana de entretenimiento  sa de sa cie  and entered france on the basis of a client contract 
in and  the company also completed acquisitions that gave it the capability to offer accounts receivable management  consulting and technical support services 
the mitre merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly the financial results of the company for and have been restated as if sitel and mitre were operated as a single company throughout these periods 
the results for these periods have also been restated to reflect the acquisition of national action financial services  inc nafs  which was also accounted for as a pooling of interests 
following the mitre merger  sitel implemented a strategy to coordinate its operations on a global basis in order to better serve the needs of its multinational clients 
a key element of this strategy in was to implement a matrix organization structure which includes i senior management teams for each of the operating regions north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america to closely monitor the operation of the business units  ii a global business development organization to seek out large call center outsourcing opportunities in the company s targeted industries  iii industry sector teams to transfer best practices and cross sell clients of one sitel region to another  and iv an intranet to make sitel s proprietary knowledge more readily available to its employees 
the costs to integrate and coordinate its global operation are not reflected in the company s pre financial results  as they were first incurred in and will occur in the future 
the company believes that  as of the end of  most of the basic infrastructure needed to manage and coordinate its global operation had been established although the company will regularly seek to add depth and talent to its management team as the business expands 
the company expects to enter fewer new markets in as a percentage of total markets served than it did in and expects to consummate fewer acquisitions in than it did in  although management will continue to be opportunistic

year issue the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
specifically  computational errors are a known risk with respect to dates after december  sitel has made a preliminary assessment of its year compliance issues  but has not developed a general plan to address such issues 
although the company has not yet estimated the total costs needed for year compliance  the company believes it will be able to upgrade and maintain its computer systems to recognize years beginning with and that the cost to do so will not be material to its financial position or liquidity 
such costs may  however  be material to the company s results of operations  particularly on a short term basis 
quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience quarterly variations in its results of operations principally due to the timing of clients teleservicing campaigns and the commencement of new contracts  revenue mix  and the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support new business 
the company experiences periodic fluctuations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion into a new region and the implementation of clients teleservicing activities 
in addition  the company s business tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe and  to a lesser degree  in the first quarter due to the changeover of client marketing strategies which often occurs at the beginning of the year 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on the company s operations in the future
