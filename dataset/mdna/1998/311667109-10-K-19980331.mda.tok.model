item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in and were million and million  respectively 
a substantial portion of the shipments reflects orders received in when the dollar value of the company s order intake was higher than that experienced in prior years 
management still considers the markets served by the company s products to be extremely competitive and  to some extent  affected by continuing uncertainty in eastern europe and the middle east 
additionally  far eastern markets are particularly competitive and volatile at this time 
certain southeast asian countries are experiencing currency instability which contributes to uncertainty in the region 
many rubber manufacturers also continue to operate at less than full capacity 
management anticipates that the markets served by the company s products will remain extremely competitive and that those markets characterized by economic and political uncertainty will likely continue to be affected by such conditions 
the company received approximately million in orders during compared to million in when the company received several individually large orders 
in the case of major equipment orders  up to months are required to complete the manufacturing process 
accordingly  revenues reported in the statement of operations may represent orders received in the current or previous fiscal periods 
in addition  the cyclical nature of industry demand and  therefore  order intake  may affect the company s results of operations 
the company s ability to maintain and increase net sales depends upon a strengthening and stability in the company s traditional markets 
gross margin in and was million and million  respectively  representing a decrease in the gross margin percentage to from 
this decline is largely due to the mix of products sold in the two periods and to continued stiff competition 
the shipments also include a higher relative proportion of new machine sales than in which generate lower margins than the company s more profitable spare parts  rebuild and repair business 
the margin also reflects the impact of a 
million increase in commissions on shipments to markets in the world where the company must use outside representatives in addition to its sales force to conduct business 
market conditions continue to exert significant pressure on margins  a trend which is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
operating expenses were reduced million to million in compared to the decline in administrative costs is largely due to reduced investment banking fees 
the increase in selling expenses of 
million to million in as compared to is largely attributed to increased marketing programs including costs to attend the premier plastic industry convention in the united states  which occurs every three years 
research and development expenses declined primarily as a result of reduced headcount 
lastly  the reduction in operating costs is also due to continuing efforts to strictly control expenses 
page of during the company substantially completed the consolidation of its domestic assembly  repair and spare parts operations  from two facilities  derby and ansonia in connecticut  to available space in the ansonia facility  to reduce operating costs and enhance efficiencies 
the cost of this project through december  was approximately million  which included capitalized costs of approximately 
million for improvements to facilities and equipment in while the company expects cost savings to result from this consolidation  the size of such savings cannot be predicted with any certainty 
as a result of this consolidation  the company s derby facility is held as available for sale or lease 
the company has transferred the remaining book value of this facility and any remaining assets no longer anticipated to be used from property  plant  and equipment to other assets at the end of subsequent to december   the company signed a conditional letter of intent to sell the derby property 
the letter of intent is subject to various terms and conditions  some of which may affect the net proceeds or consummation of the sale 
no loss on the disposal of the assets is anticipated at this time  and  as a result  no provision for loss has been made 
it is possible that proceeds realized from the disposal of these assets may be less than the remaining book value 
the recoverability of these assets will be evaluated periodically as required by fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
other income  net of other expense  includes approximately 
million from the disposal of machinery and equipment the company will no longer use which results from consolidating its two connecticut facilities into one single facility 
the consolidation has been substantially completed

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal management believes the company operates in markets which are extremely competitive  and to some extent  affected by continuing after effects of recessions in the capital goods markets in western europe  as well as ongoing political and economic uncertainty in eastern europe and the middle east 
far eastern markets remain particularly competitive and difficult to penetrate 
many rubber and plastic manufacturers also continue to operate at less than full capacity 
the timing of receipt of customer orders will also impact the relative level of shipments in any financial reporting period 
management is encouraged by the recent improvement in the level of order intake and backlog  as discussed later 
it does  however  anticipate that the markets served by the company s products will remain extremely competitive and that those markets characterized by economic and political uncertainty will likely continue to be affected by such conditions 
gross margin was million in compared to the million generated in the percentage also declined in to percent from percent in the year to year comparison is attributed to the mix of products sold  which can differ significantly from one period to the next  and to continued stiff competition 
in addition  management has elected to pursue certain machinery rebuild markets more aggressively to increase market share  and has accepted lower margins in the near term to do so 
the market conditions discussed above continue to exert significant pressure on the level of margin percentage achieved  a trend which is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
in an effort to compensate for the significant pressure on margins  management has taken several measures to aggressively control costs in recent years including the consolidation of component manufacturing into the company s uk plant during the company s uk plant was selected for this cost effective consolidation into a single facility due to its more modern equipment and its greater supply of readily available skilled labor 
assembly operations continue to be performed in both the united states and the united kingdom page of total operating expenses were reduced approximately 
million to million in compared to million in savings were generated in all three categories of operating costs largely due to the elimination of selected executive and staff positions worldwide 
the reduction in selling expenses also reflects the consolidation of the company s marketing offices in continental europe to england 
administrative costs in included 
million of third party costs which were deferred in prior years in connection with efforts  ultimately unsuccessful  to identify  negotiate  and contract with several acquisition candidates  primarily outside the united states 
this non recurring write off of previously deferred costs has largely offset the other savings previously discussed 
no further costs were deferred during the income tax rate  as a percentage of pre tax income  was compared to in the relatively low rate is attributed to the combination of the pre tax loss in the united states and taxable income in the united kingdom 
the company provides for income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it pays income taxes at the statutory rates in effect in each jurisdiction adjusted for differences in providing for income taxes between financial reporting and income tax purposes

orders and backlog orders received by the company during decreased million  or roughly  to approximately million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in orders compared to is distributed across product lines and geographically around the world with the largest regional decrease occurring in the far east  due to the uncertain economic environment at this time 
in the case of major equipment orders  up to twelve months are required to complete the manufacturing process 
accordingly  revenues reported in the statement of operations may represent orders received in the current or previous periods during which economic conditions had been severely depressed in various geographic markets of the world 
further  the cyclical nature of industry demand and  therefore  the timing of order intake may effect the company s quarterly results in the current and future fiscal quarters
