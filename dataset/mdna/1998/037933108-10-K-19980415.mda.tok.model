item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in june  the company announced that it retained an investment banking firm as its financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  including the possible sale  merger  or recapitalization of the company 
in february  the company accepted the proposal of a private investment firm to enter into a recapitalization transaction 
in april  the company announced that the transaction would not be completed see liquidity and capital resources 
the entire process has given rise to uncertainty within the company s workforce  the impact of which is difficult to determine  but which undoubtedly has shifted focus away from the company s operational priorities and may have impacted its financial results 
results of operations net revenues the company derives substantially all of its revenue from the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry in principally three service lines home respiratory therapy including home delivered respiratory medications  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment 
in all three lines  the company provides patients with a variety of clinical services  related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
substantially all of the company s revenues are reimbursed by third party payors  including medicare  medicaid  managed care organizations and private insurers  representing approximately   and  respectively 
in and  management considered the company s comprehensive  integrated service offerings and broad geographic coverage a distinct competitive advantage for obtaining managed care business 
accordingly  efforts were focused on increasing managed care market share by offering a broad range of services through the company s extensive branch network 
in june of  the company determined that this strategy had negatively impacted its financial performance  particularly for infusion therapy  because of significant managed care price compression  difficulties in billing and collecting from managed care organizations and losses of traditional referral business due to the company s focus on managed care business opportunities 
in response to these conditions  management reevaluated its strategies and began efforts to exit certain managed care contracts not meeting minimum profitability thresholds  as well as certain lower margin service lines and began to reemphasize traditional referral based business on a service line basis 
traditional referral sources include physicians  hospitals  medical groups and home health agencies 
to maximize its ability to obtain a larger share of the traditional market  the company is currently recruiting approximately account executives to increase its sales force 
also in  the company organized a physician relations group to place outbound telephone calls to physician offices in an effort to increase and enhance awareness of and stimulate interest in the company s services 
service lines targeted for exit in included medical supplies  women s health and nursing management which represented annual revenues of approximately million 
some portion of the medical supply and nursing business is expected to continue due to customer requirements 
a consequence of the initiatives to exit certain service lines and to exit certain low margin managed care contracts was the unintended loss of related business 
one contract  considered to be significant representing of net revenues  was lost 
through the end of  the company had exited contracted business representing approximately million in annual revenues 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  dollars in millions respiratory therapy infusion therapy home medical equipment other total net revenues 
   respiratory therapy approximately of the company s respiratory therapy revenues are derived from the provision of oxygen systems  nebulizers devices to aerosolize medication and home ventilators 
the remaining respiratory revenues are generated from the provision of apnea monitors used to monitor the vital signs of newborns  continuous positive airway pressure cpap bipap devices used to control adult sleep apnea  noninvasive positive pressure ventilation nppv  and other respiratory therapy products 
respiratory therapy revenues are obtained predominantly from traditional referral sources and reimbursed primarily by payors other than managed care 
the increase in respiratory therapy revenues in over is due to the company s concerted effort in to refocus on respiratory therapy and to increase the number of territories covering this higher margin traditional business 
the decrease in respiratory revenues in over was due primarily to the company s reduced emphasis on traditional referral business at that time and to business disruptions caused by merger related facility consolidations and system conversions 
in august  the balanced budget act of was adopted which includes several provisions affecting medicare reimbursement for home medical equipment and services 
effective january   reimbursement for home oxygen services has been reduced by and will be reduced an additional in also effective january   was a freeze on consumer price index based increases until medicare reimbursed home oxygen services represented approximately of the company s net revenues in the company estimates the impact of the reduction on revenues to be million to million 
infusion therapy home infusion therapy involves the administration of hour access to intravenous or enteral nutrition  anti infectives  chemotherapy and other intravenous and injectable medications 
depending on the therapy  a broad range of venous access devices and pump technology may be used to facilitate homecare and patient independence 
a significant portion of infusion therapy revenues is obtained and reimbursed under contracts with managed care organizations 
the reduction in infusion therapy revenues in as compared to is due to formidable price competition at the local and national levels  the termination or loss of certain contracts and the company s focus on the respiratory business 
to address the downward trend  the company  among other steps  is recruiting sales representatives specializing in infusion therapy  adding an infusion therapy focus to its physician relations program  adopting related market research initiatives and redesigning marketing literature to provide a more clinical focus 
in an effort to improve the operating efficiencies of the infusion therapy service line  the company began a process in late of consolidating certain of its pharmacy locations 
currently  the company operates pharmacy locations  down from locations a year ago 
the consolidation of locations may result in lower infusion revenues in future periods 
the increase in infusion therapy revenues in over was due primarily to the company s focus on obtaining managed care business during and home medical equipment other the company s primary emphasis in the home medical equipment service line of business is on the provision of patient room equipment  principally hospital beds and wheelchairs  to its patients receiving respiratory or infusion therapy 
a significant portion of the company s home medical equipment revenues are derived from and paid under managed care contracts 
home medical equipment other revenues remained flat from to this represents growth in the early part of due to the company s emphasis on obtaining managed care business as offset by the loss of medical supply and nursing revenues in the latter part of the increase in home medical equipment revenues in over was due primarily to the managed care focus in and the freeze on consumer price index based medicare reimbursement increases discussed above is applicable to certain patient service equipment items within the company s home medical equipment line 
revenue adjustments due to the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services and or from certain payors  adjustments to billed amounts are fairly common and are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or upon account review 
such revenue adjustments result from incorrect contract prices entered upon service delivery due to complex contract terms  a biller s lack of familiarity with a contract or payor or an incorrect system price  subsequent changes to estimated revenue amounts for services not covered by a preexisting contract and failure subsequent to service delivery to qualify a patient for reimbursement due to lack of written authorization or a missed filing or appeal deadline 
the increase in the company s average collection period from approximately days in to approximately days in and early increased the level of unidentified revenue adjustments accumulating in accounts receivable 
in addition  the significant number of information system conversions performed in the second and third quarters of and the high rate of turnover among billing and collection personnel in and impeded normal processing and account reviews and resulted in an increased rate of billing errors in the second half of and first half of a number of steps were taken in and to mitigate the impact of conversion disruptions and employee turnover see liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  in connection with the company s year end audit  management refined its procedures for estimating the allowance amount needed to reduce gross accounts receivable to the estimated net collectible amount 
specifically  management began to estimate and provide for unidentified revenue adjustments 
as a result  in and in  management estimated and recorded adjustments to reduce net revenues and accounts receivable by million and million  respectively 
gross profit gross margins were in  in and in gross profit decreased million  an amount equal to of net revenues  in as compared to significant components of the decrease include an increase of million in charges for excess quantities  obsolescence and shrinkage of patient service equipment and inventory due  in part  to the company s decision to exit certain lines of business  and an increase in patient service equipment depreciation of million over due to higher levels of asset purchases in and nursing costs increased by million in versus  which represents a much higher rate of increase than in the related revenues 
also contributing to the decline in gross margins was the focus the company placed on increasing managed care market share in  and the early part of to address the downward pressure of managed care pricing on gross margins  the company adopted a number of initiatives  including the decisions to exit certain contracts not meeting profitability standards and to exit the lower margin medical supply and home health nursing lines see net revenues 
other initiatives the company adopted to improve its gross margins include phasing out subrented patient service equipment and placing sales force incentives on certain higher margin products and services 
further  late in  the company established automated purchasing budgets to more effectively control the purchase and use of patient service equipment which contributed to a million reduction in net patient service equipment purchases in  as compared to gross profit increased million in as compared to but decreased as a percentage of net revenues by 
approximately half of the margin decrease was due to higher product and supply costs resulting from higher volumes of lower margin medical supply  infusion therapy and other services 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the significant increase in the bad debt provision rate for as compared to was due primarily to the significant increase in bad debt write offs experienced during the year 
the provision for doubtful accounts included adjustments of million and million recorded in the second and fourth quarters  respectively  to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the second quarter adjustment resulted from the lower than expected improvement in the aging of accounts receivable and collection timing and rates 
management had expected the impact of the field information system conversions and high turnover among billing and collection personnel to have been substantially reversed by the middle of however  the dollar amount and percentage of accounts aged over days at may  remained comparable to the december  amount and percentage and the average collection period had decreased by only four days 
as a result  management increased its allowance estimate for accounts aged over days to provide for write offs of older accounts expected to be taken in the ensuing months 
the adjustment also provided for an increased allowance estimate for accounts aged less than days  necessitated by billing and collection difficulties that continued into early see liquidity and capital resources 
the fourth quarter adjustment resulted primarily from refinements to the company s allowance estimation procedures made as a result of management s year end analysis of accounts receivable 
specifically  based on tests of subsequent realization and review of patient billing files at selected billing locations  increases were made to the percentages applied to the company s accounts receivable aging to estimate allowance amounts 
in addition  due to an increasing tendency for certain managed care payors to accumulate significant amounts of patient balances  a specific review and allowance estimation was performed for payors with large aggregate patient balances 
the provision for doubtful accounts included million for an impairment in abbey healthcare group incorporated s abbey infusion therapy accounts receivable  million resulting from the application of more conservative allowance percentages to abbey s home medical equipment and respiratory therapy accounts aged in excess of days and million for the anticipated impact on realization of the company s accounts receivable resulting from field location consolidations  changes in billing and collection personnel and information systems conversions see liquidity and capital resources 
the million provision for abbey s infusion therapy accounts resulted primarily from the deterioration in the aging of infusion accounts experienced in connection with abbey s efforts to integrate the operations of total pharmaceutical care tpc  acquired in november  and protocare  inc protocare  acquired in march selling  distribution and administrative selling  distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and  for  and  respectively 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses in increased million over the increase is due  in part  to increased staffing in the functional areas of reimbursement  patient services and information systems to address the operating difficulties the company has been experiencing in those areas see liquidity and capital resources 
also  severance and related excise tax expense totaling million was incurred in connection with the third and fourth quarter terminations of executive management level employees some of which will be replaced and approximately field employees 
the annual salary and benefit costs of terminated employees amounted to approximately million 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses in also includes charges of million incurred in connection with exiting certain business lines and closing facilities 
the company is currently recruiting approximately account executives for its sales force  an action which is expected to increase sales salary  commission and benefit costs by approximately million in the improvement in as compared to  can be attributed mainly to the cost savings associated with the completed employee reductions and facility consolidations effected in conjunction with the merger 
also contributing to the improvement in as compared to was the cessation of various integration costs included in the amount 
such costs  which totaled approximately million  included employee relocation  temporary and transitional employee costs  overtime pay and consulting 
as discussed previously  the company has exited certain lines of business and contracts 
these actions  along with the reduction in medicare reimbursement for respiratory services effective january   have reduced the company s annual revenue run rate 
accordingly  management is currently evaluating its business model  operating strategies and cost structure to identify appropriate changes that can be made to reduce costs 
the company has engaged consultants to evaluate process efficiencies for certain functional areas and to assist in assessing the company s business model 
these efforts are intended to bring operating costs in line with the lower revenue base 
goodwill impairment certain conditions  including the company s failure to meet projections and expectations  declining gross margins  recurring operating losses  downward adjustment to the company s projections for and a depressed common stock value  were identified by management as potential indicators of intangible asset impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  management conducted an evaluation of the carrying value and amortization periods of the company s recorded intangible assets 
management considered current and anticipated industry conditions  recent changes in its business strategies  and current and anticipated operating results 
the evaluation resulted in a reduction of the amortization period for its infusion business goodwill from years to years consistent with the life used for the company s goodwill related to businesses other than infusion and an impairment charge of million 
the reduction in the amortization period of infusion business goodwill and the write off will result in a net reduction in future annual amortization expense of million 
of the total impairment charge recorded  million related to infusion business goodwill 
the infusion business goodwill  with a net carrying value of million prior to the impairment charge  was originally recorded in connection with the acquisition by abbey of two infusion companies tpc in november and protocare in march the remaining million of the total impairment charge related to home respiratory and medical equipment hme rt business goodwill 
the hme rt business goodwill  with a net carrying value of million prior to the impairment charge  was recorded in connection with the acquisitions of local and regional hme rt companies 
the impairment recognized for hme rt goodwill was due primarily to the estimated impact on future operating results and cash flows of a reduction in medicare reimbursement for respiratory therapy services of effective january  and an additional effective january  the impairment recognized for infusion business goodwill resulted primarily from deteriorating operating and industry trends and lower future earnings expectations 
the company s infusion revenues  which grew by from to  lagged expectations by about and in and  respectively  and infusion gross margins in those years were below expectations and declining 
at the time  management believed that the lower revenues and gross margins were due to difficulties and disruptions caused by the consolidation of its branch operations and conversion of its field information systems following the merger in management expected revenue growth and higher margins to resume in however  infusion revenues decreased by in  lagging expectations by about and infusion gross margins dropped an additional 
over the most recent three year period  infusion gross margins dropped while the gross margins for the company s other homecare services decreased only 
the deterioration in infusion revenues and gross margins in resulted from the combined and related impacts of increased managed care market share  competitive pricing pressures and changes in service mix from higher margin therapies to lower margin therapies 
for purposes of determining recoverability  undiscounted cash flows were estimated on a business line infusion and hme rt and branch specific basis 
separate evaluations were performed for the company s infusion and hme rt business goodwill because of separate identification in the accounting records  deteriorating infusion specific industry trends and the company s recent change in emphasis from broad integrated services to separate service lines 
on a branch specific basis  undiscounted cash flows were estimated for each acquired business based on forecasted cash flows projected over the estimated remaining amortization period of the goodwill 
overhead costs substantially related to branch operations were allocated to the locations 
for those locations for which undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying amount of goodwill and other long lived assets  fair value was estimated at four and six times estimated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for infusion and hme rt acquired businesses  respectively 
the multiples were determined  in part  by reference to recent publicized transactions 
information systems hardware and internally developed software impairment during  management reevaluated its current information systems in light of year risks and ongoing operational difficulties and concluded that significant additional costs would be necessary to adequately correct system deficiencies and improve functionality 
accordingly  the decision was made to replace the company s systems  including internally developed software  with a large scale  fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp system 
a two year development and implementation plan was approved by the board of directors in december in light of the evaluation and decisions  management reviewed the carrying value of the capitalized software and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the charge included a million reduction to the carrying value of the company s branch information system acis program development costs million remains at december   an million write off of costs associated with acis implementation and conversion  including million for the cost of developing conversion software  and a million write off of costs of a specialized telecommunications software program developed for apriadirect  a clinical program that was discontinued in december in connection with management s evaluation of the company s internally developed software  management also conducted a review of the company s computer hardware  including telecommunications equipment 
equipment with a carrying value of million was identified as functionally obsolete or no longer in use and was written off 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge of million 
the charge represented computer hardware and software development costs associated with systems that were discontinued in conjunction with the merger related system consolidations 
employee contracts  benefit plan and claim settlements in  the company recorded million in benefit plan and claim settlement costs 
included are settlement amounts and related costs of million recorded in connection with two legal matters  settlement and associated costs of million related to the november termination of a proposed merger with vitas healthcare corporation and an increase in the estimated accrual for the settlement loss on the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan of million 
employee contracts  benefit plan and claim settlements of million were recorded in the total includes approximately million provided for employment and payroll tax related claims and lawsuits  million to settle certain employee contracts  and a settlement loss of million on the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
restructuring and merger costs in connection with the merger  the company initiated a significant consolidation and restructuring plan to consolidate operating locations and administrative functions within specific geographic markets 
the plan provided for a workforce reduction of approximately  employees  consolidation of approximately operating facilities and conversion of branch operating locations to a standardized information system 
the employee reduction and branch consolidations were substantially complete as of december the company also completed about half of the information system conversions as of december  the remaining system conversions were completed by september the completion of the consolidation and restructuring plan yielded savings in and labor and rent expense resulting from the reduction in employee headcount and the facility closures 
the savings however  were largely offset by operating difficulties that arose  in part  from the information systems conversions and integration efforts see liquidity and capital resources and by the impact on revenues  service mix and gross margins of increased managed care business see net revenues 
restructuring and merger costs of approximately million were recorded in in connection with the consolidation and restructuring plan 
restructuring costs included severance and related costs of million due to workforce reductions  million related to the closure of duplicate facilities and million for other restructuring activities 
merger costs of approximately million were incurred consisting primarily of fees for investment banking  legal  consulting  accounting and filing requirements  as well as certain other costs required to be incurred pursuant to the merger agreement 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in although long term debt has declined significantly during  the average debt balance for the year was higher than in and the increases in interest expense in and were mitigated by lower average interest rates than in the preceding year see liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes income tax expense for amounted to million and included million to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to recurring tax losses and lower estimates of future taxable income 
the remaining amount of income tax expense includes estimated state taxes payable based on factors other than income  estimated settlement amounts for in progress state tax audits  foreign taxes related to the sale in of the company s equity interest in a united kingdom based company and the settlement amount paid on an examination of the company s federal tax returns for through certain of these tax expense items resulted in increases to deferred tax assets for which no benefit was recorded in due to offsetting increases to the valuation allowance 
income tax expense for amounted to million and represented of income before taxes 
the deductibility in of certain accruals and merger related reserves established in resulted in a tax loss  an increase in refundable taxes due to a carryback of a portion of the tax loss  and a decrease in net deferred tax assets 
the tax benefit of million includes tax impact on extraordinary charge of million was primarily attributable to losses related to merger reserves and restructuring charges recorded during liquidity and capital resources in the company generated million in operating cash flow compared to cash used in operating activities of million and million in and  respectively 
improved collections on accounts receivable  lower expenditures for patient service equipment and inventory  and the receipt of income tax refunds were the primary sources of operating cash flow 
the primary reason for the increased use of cash in as compared to was the increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  before allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased by million in the decrease resulted from the combined impacts of higher collection rates as evidenced by the increase in collections as a percentage of revenue from in to in  shorter collection periods as reflected by a decrease in the company s average collection period from approximately days in to approximately days in and an increase in the amount of bad debt write offs taken  net of recoveries  from million in to million in accounts aged in excess of days at december  decreased by million as compared to december  but represented a comparable percentage of total accounts receivable 
the improvements to date in collection rates and timing occurred substantially in the second half of through may  accounts receivable  before allowance for doubtful accounts  had decreased by only million and the amount and percentage of accounts aged over days was substantially unchanged from december  the slower than anticipated decrease in accounts receivable and the aging of accounts was due to the continuing effects of disruptions and delays in billing and collection activity associated with the company s and conversions of its field locations to standardized information systems and the continuing impact of a higher than normal turnover rate among billing and collection personnel in in connection with the facility consolidations made in late and early as part of the company s restructuring and consolidation plan  each branch information system was first converted to the predominant system in place within its region 
conversion of the branches to a standard  company wide system then occurred on a region by region basis 
because of the conversion to interim systems prior to final conversion  locations representing approximately of the company s net revenues underwent conversion 
of the conversions  about half were completed by december  the remaining conversions  comprised mainly of the company s larger branches  were completed by september  with  and branches converted in the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
these activities contributed to billing delays and errors and  ultimately  difficulties in receiving timely reimbursement for services provided 
actions taken in to mitigate the impact of conversion disruptions and employee turnover included  among others  a collection incentive program with special emphasis on older accounts  hiring additional management level billing and collection personnel and reinforcement training for the billing locations 
in early  the company took further steps to reduce the incidence of billing errors including a process review of the field information systems to identify opportunities to improve billing processing  timeliness and accuracy  validation of system pricing files and implementation of billing center audits to assess compliance with billing practices and procedures 
in the second quarter of  the company reorganized the reimbursement and information system functions 
these actions  among others  contributed to improvements in the second half of in billing timeliness and accuracy and collection rates and time frames 
during the second half of significant focus and resources continued to be directed at the improvement of order intake  fulfillment and billing and collection processes 
in connection with those efforts  the company evaluated the adequacy of the functionality of its field information systems and that of other packaged home healthcare information systems to meet its changing business and reimbursement needs 
based on the results of the evaluation  management decided to replace its existing systems but found the packaged home healthcare information systems to be insufficient for the company s needs 
rather  management committed to a two year plan to implement a large scale  fully integrated erp system 
significant development effort will be required to customize the erp system for the complexities of the company s billing and contractual arrangements

the new system  which will be year compliant from the outset  is not expected to be fully functional at all locations by the beginning of the year additionally  a formal process has been instituted to assess other potential risks the company may face in light of the year issue 
examples of such issues include  but are not limited to  electronic interfaces with external agents such as payors  banks and suppliers and internal operational issues such as date sensitive security systems and elevators 
another area of potential risk is with certain patient service equipment items that have microprocessors with date functionality which could malfunction in the year among other steps  the company has initiated formal communications with all its significant suppliers of its patient service equipment to ensure those third parties are also working to remediate their own year issues  if applicable 
the company believes that it will be able to resolve these issues and any others it may identify by the year the cost of such remediation has not yet been quantified
