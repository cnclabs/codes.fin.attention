this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  gross premiums written decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the table below summarizes the company s gross premiums written by line of business expressed in millions of dollars year ended year ended september  september  type of reinsurance change us property us international property catastrophe total property catastrophe other lines reinstatements  adjustments and no claims bonuses total gross premiums written the overall decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to a reduction in gross premiums written in the company s core product  property catastrophe reinsurance  from million for the year ended september  to million  a decrease of 
of this reduction approximately related to the international property catastrophe book and related to the united states property catastrophe book 
the reduction was greater in the international property catastrophe book as the company reduced its line sizes on certain proportional treaties pursuant to its policy of reducing aggregate exposures in a declining rate environment 
this accounted for approximately million of the decrease in the international property catastrophe book 
approximately of the decrease in the united states property catastrophe book related to a multi year contract which was written in the year ended september  and hence no written premium was recorded in the year ended september  the remaining decrease in the total property catastrophe book was due to continuing competitive rates 
based on the company s experience  rates for property catastrophe business written in the year ended september   were approximately and below those experienced in the year ended september  for international and united states property catastrophe business respectively 
this led to lower priced premiums in comparison to those written in the year ended september  and the non renewal of contracts in certain cases where the company considered the business to be under priced 
for the year ended september   the company experienced a reduction in the number of property catastrophe contracts written from  in the year ended september  to contracts for the year ended september  k the decline in gross premiums written by the company was partially offset by an increase of million in respect of gross premiums written in other non property catastrophe lines 
the increase was primarily due to increased gross premiums written by lasalle re capital  which commenced underwriting as a corporate member of lloyd s in january  the second quarter of the fiscal year 
for the year ended september   lasalle re capital wrote gross premiums of million compared to million for the year ended september  also  the company increased the size of its terrorism and political risks book which accounted for approximately million of gross premiums written for the year ended september  compared with approximately million for the year ended september  in addition  for the year ended september   an amount of million relating to adjustment premiums  reinstatement premiums and no claims bonuses produced a reduction in gross premiums written 
in the year ended september   there was a positive adjustment to gross premiums written of million 
this was principally due to insignificant premium adjustments and  due to increased loss activity  to increased reinstatement premiums and lower no claims bonuses 
premiums ceded for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september  and related to reinsurance protection purchased by lasalle re with effect from january  and to various reinsurance protections purchased by lasalle re capital 
ceded premiums amortized increased from million in the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to the reinsurance protections purchased by lasalle re capital  which were amortized in line with the premiums earned by lasalle re capital 
net premiums earned decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was the result of reduced premiums earned on the company s core property catastrophe business that was partially offset by increased earned premiums on those premiums written by lasalle re capital 
premiums written by lasalle re capital are earned over a period of months from the inception date of the underlying contracts 
premiums on property catastrophe excess of loss contracts are earned over the period coverage is provided  which is generally months 
under proportional property catastrophe contracts  with the risks underlying the contracts incepting throughout the contract period  premiums are generally earned over months 
premiums on other lines of business are earned over the period for which coverage is provided  which generally ranges between months and months 
net investment income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase was attributable to a larger average investment base compared to the year ended september  annualized investment income as a percentage of the average market value of invested assets was for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september net realized gains on investments were million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  during the year ended september  the company realized gains on investments as part of an exercise undertaken to increase the credit quality of the portfolio 
in addition  during the last quarter of the year ended september   the company took advantage of market conditions by realizing some of the large unrealized gains in the portfolio 
the proceeds from this exercise were reinvested in securities with marginally lower yields 
other income was derived from a contract under which the company provided certain reinsurance related services 
this contract was not renewed january  the following table sets forth the company s combined ratios for the years ended september  and september  september  loss and loss expense ratio expense ratio combined ratio k losses and loss expenses incurred increased from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this was due to an increase in the number of worldwide catastrophic events that affected the company during the year ended september  the largest loss event to affect the company was hurricane georges  which occurred in september the company established a million loss provision for this event that represented of the losses incurred for the year ended september  in addition  throughout the year ended september   the company incurred losses in respect of various weather related events  notably uk midland floods million  canadian winter freeze million and various us storms million 
the company sustained a number of claims relating to aggregate stop loss and excess of loss contracts  which accounted for approximately million or of losses incurred 
a large percentage of these aggregate losses incurred in the year ended september  related to losses that had occurred in prior years 
this was due to the extended loss reporting periods on these contracts  a number of which had a period of months after the expiry of the contract within which to report losses 
also  as a result of increasing other lines of business the company incurred losses relating to lasalle re capital million  satellite coverages million  various risk excess coverages million and political risks coverages million 
as a result of the current year loss activity  the company has increased the level of incurred but not reported reserves

underwriting expenses decreased from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of net premiums earned  underwriting expenses were for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september  fees accrued pursuant to the underwriting services agreement as a percentage of net premiums earned decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  this was due to the higher loss activity and lower premium earnings in the year ended september  compared with the year ended september  the company s level of brokerage fees and ceding commissions increased to of net premiums earned for the year ended september  from of net premiums earned for the year ended september  the increase was partly due to an increase in earned premiums written by lasalle re capital  whose expense ratio was approximately and partly due to an increase in the average cost of writing proportional business 
operational expenses decreased from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of net premiums earned  operational expenses were during the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september  effective october   the administrative services agreement with arc was terminated and all of the personnel assigned to the company by arc became employees of the company  with the company assuming the functions previously performed by arc 
this generated a reduction in operational expenses of approximately million  as the fees paid to arc were in excess of the additional costs assumed by the company 
in addition  the company experienced a reduction in executive compensation of approximately million  due partly to a decline in the fair value of stock appreciation rights and partly to reduced bonus provisions 
these decreases were offset by increased costs of million relating to lasalle re capital and fees paid to directors 
corporate expenses decreased from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the costs incurred in the year ended september  related to costs associated with the company s investigation of potential merger and acquisition transactions 
corporate expenses for the year ended september  included costs associated with the secondary offering  the preferred offering  the tender offer  the formation costs of lasalle re capital  the company s move to the new york stock exchange and fees incurred with respect to the cateput

these costs were borne by the selling shareholders in the secondary offering 
in respect of the preferred offering  the underwriting discount was charged to additional paid in capital 
k interest expense increased from million in the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the increase was due to additional financing charges associated with the deposit portion of lasalle re s ceded reinsurance contract in the year ended september  as the contract incepted january   only three quarters of the annual charge was included in the year ended september  other interest expenses related to the annual administration fee and the ongoing commitment fees payable on the company s credit facility 
as at september   there were no borrowings under this facility 
foreign exchange gains in the year ended september  were negligible at million compared to losses of million in the year ended september  the losses in the year ended september  resulted from the unfavorable closing of a sterling forward contract  and an overall strengthening of the us dollar against the major foreign currencies in which the company wrote premiums 
earnings per common share were for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  earnings per common share assuming dilution were for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings assuming dilution decreased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  the decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding resulted primarily from the repurchase of shares in the tender offer in april year ended september  compared with year ended september  gross premiums written decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in international property catastrophe premiums to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this reduction  in turn  was a result of the competitive rate environment  which led to a reduction in the number of international property catastrophe contracts written 
the company experienced a decrease in property catastrophe premiums written in the united states 
the decline in gross premiums written by the company was partially offset by an increase of million in respect of other non property catastrophe lines written 
this increase primarily related to premiums written in the year ended september  by lasalle re capital  which was accepted into lloyd s with effect from january  further  for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september   the company experienced a reduction in reinstatement premiums of million due to more favorable loss experience and an increase in overall negative premium adjustments of million 
premiums ceded for the year ended september  were million compared to nil in the year ended september  this was primarily attributable to reinsurance protection purchased by lasalle re with effect from january  and to reinsurance purchased by lasalle re capital 
ceded premiums amortized were million for the year ended september  compared to nil in the year ended september  net premiums earned decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was principally due to the overall decrease in premiums written in the previous fiscal year and the year ended september  net investment income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase was principally attributable to an increase in yields during the year ended september   together with a larger average investment base compared to the year ended september  annualized investment income as a percentage of the average market value of invested assets was for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september net realized gains on investments were million during the year ended september  compared to net realized losses during the year ended september  k other income was derived from reinsurance related services providing an annual fee of million 
as the provision of these services began on january   there was no corresponding income in the year ended september the following table sets forth the company s combined ratios for the years ended september  and september  september  loss and loss expense ratio expense ratio combined ratio losses and loss expenses incurred decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was a result of the limited number of worldwide catastrophic events that affected the company during the year 
losses and loss expenses incurred during the year ended september  primarily included million for floods in eastern europe  million in respect of various international windstorms and winter storm activity in the united states and million adverse development on hurricane fran  which occurred in september losses and loss expenses incurred during the year ended september  included additional reserves of million for hurricanes marilyn and luis and various other losses emanating from the hurricane season and end of the hurricane season and international storms 
underwriting expenses decreased from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of net premiums earned  underwriting expenses were for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september  of this increase  was due to the settlement of significant profit commissions on one program underwritten in previous fiscal years  which had better than expected loss ratios  and the provision for profit commission on contracts underwritten in the current fiscal year 
in addition  the business underwritten by lasalle re capital has higher underwriting costs  which increases the company s percentage of underwriting expenses to net premiums earned 
the company experienced an increase in the fees and profit commission accrued under the underwriting services agreement from of net premiums earned for the year ended september  to net premiums earned for the year ended september  operational expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase was substantially due to additional executive compensation and expenses relating to the operation of lasalle re capital 
corporate expenses were million for the year ended september   compared with million for the year ended september  corporate expenses for the year ended september  included costs associated with the secondary offering  the preferred offering  the tender offer  the formation costs of lasalle re capital  the company s move to the new york stock exchange and fees incurred with respect to the cateput 
in  corporate expenses included costs associated with the initial public offering and all costs associated with the establishment of the company s credit facility 
corporate expenses do not include the underwriting discounts associated with the various offerings 
these costs were borne by the selling shareholders in the initial public offering and the secondary offering 
in respect of the preferred offering  the underwriting discount was charged to additional paid in capital 
interest expense was million during the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september  this increase was due to financing charges associated with the deposit portion of lasalle re s ceded reinsurance contract 
other interest expenses related to the annual administration fee and the ongoing commitment fees payable on the company s credit facility 
as at september   there were no borrowings under this facility 
k foreign exchange losses in the year ended september  were million compared to losses of million in the year ended september  the losses in the year ended september  resulted from the unfavorable closing of a sterling forward contract  and an overall strengthening of the us dollar since january  against the major foreign currencies in which the company writes premiums 
the losses for the year ended september  were the result of several factors  including the decrease in the value of yen and deutschmarks relative to the us dollar 
additionally  the company s sterling foreign exchange contracts precluded participation in the appreciation of sterling in the third fiscal quarter above the company s average forward rate 
earnings per common share were for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  earnings per common share assuming dilution were for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  following the tender offer  the adjusted weighted average number of common shares outstanding decreased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  this decrease generated a accretive effect on the company s net income per share 
liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  the company s assets consist primarily of all of the outstanding voting stock of lasalle re 
the company s cash flows depend primarily on dividends and other permitted payments from lasalle re 
lasalle re s sources of funds consist of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay losses and loss expenses  brokerage  commissions  excise taxes  administrative expenses and dividends 
under the insurance act  lasalle re is prohibited from paying dividends of more than of its opening statutory capital and surplus unless it files an affidavit at least days before payment of such dividends stating that it will continue to meet the required solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio requirements and from declaring or paying any dividends without the approval of the minister of finance if it failed to meet its required margins in the previous fiscal year 
the insurance act also requires lasalle re to maintain a minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio and prohibits dividends that would result in a breach of these requirements 
in addition  lasalle re is prohibited under the insurance act from reducing its total opening statutory capital by or more without the approval of the minister of finance 
lasalle re currently meets its requirements under the insurance act 
in addition  the payment of dividends by lasalle re is subject to the rights of holders of the exchangeable non voting shares to receive a pro rata share of any dividend and to its need to maintain shareholders equity adequate to support the level of lasalle re s reinsurance operations 
operating activities provided net cash of million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  cash flows from operations in future years may differ substantially from net income 
cash flows are affected by loss payments  which  due to the nature of the reinsurance coverage provided by lasalle re  are generally expected to comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and can therefore fluctuate significantly from year to year 
the irregular timing of these large loss payments can create significant variations in operating cash flows between periods 
lasalle re funds such payments from cash flows from operations and sales of investments 
as a result of the potential for large loss payments  lasalle re maintains a substantial portion of its assets in cash and marketable securities 
as of september   of its total assets were held in cash and marketable securities 
to further mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of potential liabilities and to minimize interest rate risk  lasalle re maintains a short average duration for its investment portfolio 
the modified average duration of the investment portfolio  including cash  was years at september  at september   the fair value of the company s total investment portfolio  including cash  was million 
cash and cash equivalents increased from million at september  to million at september  the increase was due to proceeds received on the sale of bonds in late september  which k were not re invested until post year end 
in addition the company required funds for the payment of losses  primarily as a result of hurricane georges 
the company has adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas to account for its marketable securities with all of the company s investments classified as available for sale 
under this classification  investments are recorded at fair market value and any unrealized gains or losses are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
in accordance with sfas no 
reporting of comprehensive income  the movement in unrealized gains or losses on these investments are disclosed as part of other comprehensive income 
the unrealized gain on the investment portfolio net of amounts attributable to minority interest was million at september  compared to an unrealized gain of million at september  at september   of the securities held in the company s investment portfolio were fixed income securities rated aa or better and were fixed income securities rated a or better by s p or moody s 
no single investment comprised more than of the overall portfolio 
as at september   issuers from the far east and asia represented of the investment portfolio 
these securities had a market value of million and an aggregate unrealized gain of million 
all of these securities had an average credit rating of aaa as assigned by s p or moody s  as at september during the year ended september   the company modified its investment guidelines to allow the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
in addition during the year ended september  the company entered into a swap agreement to provide cash flow to a counterparty in the event of a defined earthquake activity in japan 
receipts to the company are accounted for as investment income and are based on a percentage of the notional amount of the swap 
the contract exposes lasalle re to a maximum cash outflow of the original notional amount of million should the defined earthquake event occur 
in addition  the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter party to the remittance of interest payments as required by the swap 
reinsurance balances receivable were million at september  compared to million at september  this increase was due to the inclusion of receivable balances relating to the business underwritten by lasalle re capital 
at september   these receivable balances were million compared to million as at september  given the three year accounting methodology utilized by lloyd s  these balances will not be received until after the year deferred acquisition costs increased from million at september  to million at september  whereas unearned premiums decreased from million at september  to million at september  although the volume of gross premiums written has declined  there has been an increase in the average cost of the business written due to increased costs associated with proportional business and an increased level of lasalle re capital business 
prepaid reinsurance premiums have increased from million at september  to million at september  the increase primarily related to an increase in the level of the risk transfer portion of the company s reinsurance program and to the level of reinsurance ceded by lasalle re capital 
other assets increased from million at september  to million as at september  this was primarily due to the deposit portion of the ceded reinsurance contract  which is accounted for in accordance with sfas no and the no claims bonus provision of the contract 
in addition  following the termination of the administrative services agreement the company paid million to purchase the existing fixed assets 
the company has also purchased additional fixed assets during the year ended september  at september   the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses was million compared to million at september  the increase of million from september  was primarily due to the losses which occurred in the fourth quarter on which the company made an estimate of its total liability  notably hurricane georges 
in addition  the company increased its reserves for unpaid losses on other lines of business and the business written by lasalle re capital which  given the three year accounting methodology  will not be paid until after the year k other liabilities increased from million as at september  to million as at september  the increase of million was primarily due to liabilities established for the purchased reinsurance protections for both the company and lasalle re capital and operating expenses of lasalle re capital 
this was offset partially by a reduction in the fees accrued pursuant to the underwriting services agreement with cna bermuda which was terminated october  and the administrative services agreement with arc which was terminated october  in accordance with the terms of certain reinsurance contracts written by the company  the company has posted letters of credit in the amount of million as of september  as compared to million as of september  to support outstanding loss reserves 
in connection with lasalle re capital s support of three lloyd s syndicates  the company has posted letters of credit in the amount of million equivalent to pounds million 
in addition  in connection with the japanese earthquake swap  the company has posted a letter of credit of million 
all letters of credit are secured by a lien on the company s investment portfolio equal to of the amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
the company paid dividends on its common shares of per share in october and per share in january  april and july the company paid a quarterly dividend of per share to holders of its series a preferred shares in december and march  june and september as of september   dividends due but not yet declared on the series a preferred shares amounted to million 
based on the company s net income for the year ended september   the company currently expects to declare dividends of per common share each quarter during the fiscal year 
the actual amount and timing of any future common share dividends is at the discretion of the board 
the declaration and payment of any dividends is dependent upon the profits and financial requirements of the company and other factors  including certain legal  regulatory and other restrictions 
there can be no assurance that the company s dividend policy will not change or that the company will declare or pay any dividends in future periods 
lasalle re capital is committed to provide capital support for the underwriting year to the same lloyd s syndicates as it supported in the level of support is not expected to change materially from that provided in the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has in place a million committed line of credit from a syndicate of banks 
the proceeds from the credit facility may only be used to buy preferred shares of lasalle re that  in turn  may use the proceeds of such purchase to meet current cash requirements 
the facility matures december   and is secured by a pledge legal mortgage of all the capital stock of lasalle re held by the company  including any preferred shares that may be issued by lasalle re to the company 
the line of credit contains various covenants  including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness  restrictions on the sale or lease of assets not in the ordinary course of business  maintenance of a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated tangible net worth of no more than to  maintenance of tangible net worth at the end of each fiscal year of the greater of million or of net premiums written  maintenance of statutory capital of lasalle re of at least million  increasing to million at the end of calendar year and million at the end of calendar year and thereafter  and maintenance of a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital at the end of any fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended of no more than to in each case 
the company may pay dividends and make other restricted payments so long as  after giving effect to such restricted payments  no event of default has occurred 
dividends and restricted payments are limited to of consolidated net income for its immediately preceding fiscal year less amounts paid on the series a preferred shares 
in order for the company to pay dividends in excess of of consolidated net income  the company would have to renegotiate certain terms of its credit facility 
as of september   the credit facility had not been utilized 
the company s financial condition and results of operations are influenced by both internal and external forces 
loss payments  investment returns and premiums may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
cash flows from operations and the liquidity of its investment portfolio are  in the company s opinion  adequate to meet the company s expected cash requirements over the next months 
k in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  and requires the company to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
this standard will require additional disclosure and will be adopted by the company for the year ended september  in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as the provisions of the statement need not be applied to immaterial items  the company considers it unlikely the statement will change its disclosures significantly 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  given the limited number of transactions currently entered into by the company that are covered by the statement  the company does not anticipate any significant changes to its current financial reporting 
year issue the company s goal is to ensure that its computer systems and the computer systems of third parties that are material to the company s operations such as the computer systems of service providers  suppliers and brokers will be capable of correctly processing information relating to dates in and after the year year compliant 
the company does not believe that it faces any material year compliance problems with respect to its non information technology systems 
the company engaged international business machines corporation ibm to prepare an assessment and strategy report outlining the steps needed to make the company s computer systems year compliant 
ibm s report indicated that certain of the company s systems  applications and business interfaces have year date problems which will require an estimated person days to correct 
the company has set a target date of march  for the completion of the necessary conversions to the following systems i the senator underwriting management system  ii the rsg reinsurance system  iii other software and hardware components and infrastructure  iv enterprise wide spreadsheet and database files  v broker compliance and vi supplier compliance 
the company has budgeted million for the overall year compliance effort and has expensed million to date for the ibm assessment and strategy report 
given the current level of estimated costs  it is not anticipated that the costs of year compliance will have a material impact on the company s future results 
a number of risk factors  including but not limited to the following  could affect the company s plans to achieve year compliance by march  within the current budget 
as the company is currently completing its installation of the senator underwriting management system  any delay in completing that installation could delay the year conversion of components of that system 
to provide for that contingency  the company has contracted with outside service providers to ensure that the company s current rsg reinsurance system is year compliant by january  
the target date of march  for year compliance is based on the december commencement and timely progress of the actual software conversions 
any delays in starting or implementing the conversion process will present a significant hindrance to completing the project by the target date 

information technology it resources to implement year conversions are in short supply and the supply of external contractor resources is likely to decrease further as the year approaches 
this shortage of resources could escalate the cost of performing the conversion work beyond the current estimates 
the company intends to maximize internal it resources by freezing all discretionary changes to applications during the year conversion and does not anticipate that this will delay other significant it projects 
k 
the company has no control over the timing of year compliance by external brokers and suppliers who interface with the company 
however  the company has distributed a year compliance questionnaire to its suppliers and brokers and  as of november   of suppliers and of brokers  including the company s major suppliers and brokers  had adequately responded to the company s questionnaire 
the company also assesses the effect of the year issue on the business it underwrites  considering the exposure to year related losses on a contract by contract basis at the time of underwriting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is changing interest rates  primarily in the united states as the company has a portfolio of fixed maturity investments  of which all except one hedged international bond are denominated in us dollars 
a change in interest rates will affect the fair value of the company s investments and will lead to fluctuations in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
the company limits this risk by setting a maximum portfolio duration of four years  which is stipulated in the company s investment guidelines 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage market risk in its us dollar denominated portfolio 
in addition  the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer or country of issuer 
the table below expressed in millions of us dollars presents the par value amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s us dollar denominated investment portfolio 
total cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate investments fixed interest weighted average interest rate mortgage backed securities are included in the above table by relevant year of maturity 
in addition  unit funds which are included as part of cash and cash equivalents are included in the above table at par value 
during the year ended september   the company amended its investment guidelines to permit investment in hedged international bonds 
under this type of investment  the currency risk is negated through the use of forward contracts  with the company only being exposed to the interest rate risk on the bond purchased 
as at september   only one bond had been purchased with a par value of canadian dollars million  an interest rate of and a maturity date of the fair value of the cash and cash equivalents and the fixed interest securities as at september  was million 
in addition  the company has foreign currency risk on both reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance balances payable including payables relating to losses 
the company does not currently utilize derivative instruments to manage the company s exposure to foreign currency movements 
in the past the company has used forward contracts to eliminate the risk  however  given the uncertainty in cash flows this was not deemed to be an efficient management technique 
as of september   the majority of the company s net receivable payable position is denominated in us dollars 
as at september   the largest foreign currency exposure is sterling  as the company had a net receivable balance of pounds million 
a increase or decrease in the year end sterling us dollar exchange rate would produce a gain or loss  respectively  of million 
given the limited amount of net receivable balances in other currencies  no other currency movement has been considered
