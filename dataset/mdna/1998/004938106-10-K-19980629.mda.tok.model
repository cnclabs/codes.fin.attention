results of operations net sales change change dollars in thousands net sales    fiscal compared to fiscal effective april   the company rearranged its domestic and international distribution channels and certain sales personnel who support them 
the company s canadian customers  who were previously under the umbrella of international sales  joined with the us dealer channel to create the north american dealer channel 
the new corporate sales channel replaces the oem channel and includes value added resellers vars which were previously included in the domestic dealer channel 
the company made this adjustment to better focus its resources on meeting the unique product and service needs of its diverse customer base 
furthermore  in order to provide better information as to the company s core product revenue  the company has added a fourth revenue segment to the following analysis  denoted other 
this section includes revenue from the company s pronexus subsidiary as well as other ancillary items not directly related to sales of the company s primary products  such as royalties on patents 
for comparison purposes  the following discussion assumes these adjustments have been made on april  net sales to the company s north american dealer network during the year ended march  declined when compared to the previous year 
net sales to the north american dealer network represented and of total net sales in the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales to the north american dealer channel as a percentage of total net sales can be credited to the success of the company s strategic partner relationships as some dealers now purchase the company s products through these corporate sales customers 
the company feels this transition is a more efficient method of distributing its lower end products  as the company s dealers are more adept at providing cti capable solutions  while the strategic partners expertise is selling basic voice mail systems 
the decrease can also be attributed to the delayed release of repartee vp and cti in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company discounted certain interim sales of replay and replay plus products  which were phased out in this channel with the introduction of repartee vp and cti 
the delay also caused customers to defer orders in anticipation of the new repartee product offering 
it is anticipated that the standardization of the code base offered by repartee vp and cti will simplify the product offering by establishing a consistent feature set and the ability to offer more telephone switch integrations 
this transition also allows the company to offer telanophy capability to every repartee product sold in the channel 
the introduction of lingo helped to mitigate the overall revenue decline  of the new dealers the company added in fiscal  are specifically devoted to selling lingo 
net sales to the company s corporate sales channel increased during the year ended march  over the prior fiscal year 
net sales to corporate sales customers represented and of total net sales for the fiscal years and  respectively 
a greater than increase in the unit sales of repartee was a significant factor in this year over year change 
the release of the high unit volume in switch product during the third quarter of fiscal more than offset the year over year decline in replay systems revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company successfully launched lingo to a strategic partner  broadening the product offerings in the channel and contributing to the increase in revenue 
the company also reached an agreement with ingram micro in the quarter ended march  to distribute repartee and lingo  and to develop a sales channel for the release of the company s forthcoming nt based product 
as of march  the company had significant strategic partner relationships 
the largest corporate customer represented of the channel s sales  and of total company revenue 
net sales to international customers grew in the year ended march  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
international sales represented and of total net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in international sales can be attributed to the evolution of the company s international strategy towards a decentralized approach  providing the local sales managers the latitude to take advantage of the unique opportunities in their markets 
this strategy is exemplified by the acquisition of active voice bv  the company s european distributor 
by eliminating the middleman  the efficiency of this distribution model has allowed the company to leverage the responsiveness to its european customers 
to this end  the company is continuing to invest in product localization efforts  especially in the german and french markets 
the international channel also experienced an increase in revenue from replay  offset by declining unit sales of repartee systems and kits 
the strength of the us currency  particularly relative to the australian dollar  mitigated some of the overall increase in international revenues 
beyond the usual risks associated with international sales currency fluctuations and restrictions  export import regulations  customs matters  foreign collection problems  and military  political and transportation risks  the company s international sales involve additional governmental regulation  product adaptations to local languages and switching systems  and uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations 
other revenue comprised of the company s fiscal net sales  compared to in fiscal this increase primarily represents revenue contributed from the company s pronexus subsidiary  acquired in january the company also recognized revenues for the receipt of patent license fees related to the company s stutter detect patent 
the company experiences significant quarterly variability in the level of sales through its distinct distribution channels 
the diversification provided by these channels has in the past reduced the quarterly volatility of aggregate net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal due to the rearrangement of the sales channels and the complications in obtaining the transactional history necessary to restate fiscal results under the new reporting model  the figures are not directly comparable to the figures 
however  the numbers  which have been restated in the fiscal compared to fiscal narrative  but not in the fiscal compared to fiscal discussion  serve as a bridge between the two years so that the relationships may be inferred by comparing fiscal to  and fiscal to net sales to the company s domestic dealer network during the year ended march  were essentially unchanged from the previous year 
net sales to the domestic dealer network represented and of total net sales in the years ended march  and  respectively 
increases of approximately in unit sales of both the repartee and replay product lines were offset by an approximate decrease in unit sales of replay plus  which contributed the largest percentage of the company s total net sales 
a majority of the decrease in unit sales of replay plus was attributable to a large one time sale to a new customer in fiscal and the absence of such a sale in fiscal net sales to strategic partners increased by during the year ended march  net sales to these customers represented of total net sales for the year ended march   compared to of total net sales for the year ended march  the aggregate increase in net sales in the strategic partner channel was principally attributable to approximately and increases in unit sales of replay and replay plus  respectively  due to the successful introduction of new products for corporate customers 
the increases in unit sales of replay and replay plus were partially offset by a decline in unit sales of repartee kits  primarily to a single customer 
during december  the company announced an agreement with tadiran telecommunications  ltd 
to integrate the repartee voice processing system with tadiran s coral telephone systems 
the agreement also provides for tadiran to market telanophy 
in january  active voice announced a joint development agreement with executone information systems  inc to integrate active voice products with executone s integrated digital system and future executone telephony products 
an agreement also provides for executone to distribute repartee and telanophy unified messaging products 
in march  the company announced the formation of a strategic relationship with siemens business communication systems  inc to jointly develop multimedia messaging solutions for siemens highly integrated global communications platform 
the jointly developed windows nt based multimedia messaging platform will be distributed worldwide by siemens 
as of march   the company had six domestic strategic partner relationships 
the largest partner accounted for approximately of total strategic partner sales and approximately of total company sales during fiscal net sales to international customers increased by during the year ended march   reflecting increased penetration of international voice mail markets 
international sales represented of total net sales for the year ended march   compared to of total net sales for the prior year 
all product lines experienced growth in the international sales channel in both units and net sales over the prior fiscal year 
the company attributes the increased unit sales to well received product localization and continued strength in the australia and united kingdom markets 
gross profit change change dollars in thousands gross profit    percentage of net sales the company s gross margin varies in part depending upon the mix of higher margin voice board and software kit sales offered to all customers and software only sales  such as in switch available only to strategic partner accounts as opposed to turnkey system sales which include the cost of a pc and other related hardware 
the proportion of sales contributed from each distribution channel also affects the overall gross margin  as international sales have historically had higher gross margins than sales to the other distribution channels 
fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in gross margin between fiscal and is attributable to a variety of factors  particularly product platform changes that required the company to increase allowances for surplus and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in addition  the company wrote off the value of unreturned out of warranty items and certain demo units 
also  in the fourth quarter replay and replay plus units were discounted in preparation for the repartee transition 
the margin decrease related to the transition was offset by margin gains in the strategic partner channel with the third quarter release of the in switch product  as well as a overall increase of telanophy sales 
other factors mitigating the margin decrease included the settlement of third party vendor hardware problems as well as recognition of patent license fees related to the company s stutter detect patent 
fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in gross margin between fiscal and was due to the continued shift in the product sales mix toward the lower margin replay product line  particularly in the strategic partner sales channel 
a price reduction on replay implemented during the third quarter of fiscal contributed to the shift in sales mix and reduced the gross margin on replay units  as did the success of replay products released for two of the company s newer partners 
lower unit sales of repartee kits in the strategic partner channel  primarily to a single customer also contributed to the decline in gross margin 
the decline in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of net sales to the higher margin international sales channel and increased sales of high margin telanophy and fax related software 
research and development change change dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in research and development expenses  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of net sales between the fiscal years ending and were primarily attributable to an increase in compensation related costs associated with additional engineering and development personnel and project based contract development staff and associated recruiting costs 
the increase in engineering personnel is attributable to the company s development of new windows nt based products as well as to the addition of pronexus inc development staff 
in addition  engineering salaries have increased due to the competitive nature of the labor market and the company s effort to attract and retain skilled employees 
significant releases during fiscal included the lingo and in switch products  described above 
the introduction of repartee in the fourth quarter to the north american dealer network offers telanophy capability with every repartee system sold within the channel 
the company also developed and announced version of view call plus  which takes advantage of a powerful new scripting tool  phonebasic 
with phonebasic  view call plus can be integrated to work with a variety of general business applications 
the company believes that the international market for voice processing equipment has significant growth opportunities  but that localization of products will be necessary to successfully penetrate this market 
the company continues to allocate resources to the localization of products for the international markets and customization of products for strategic partner accounts 
the company also believes that in order to remain competitive in a rapidly changing technological environment  it will continue to be necessary to allocate significant resources to the development of new products 
the company expects the dollar amount of research and development expenditures to continue to increase for the foreseeable future  and that these expenses as a percentage of sales will vary from period to period 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increased use of project based contract development resources and increases in engineering and development personnel 
the increase in contract development staff and engineering personnel was attributable to the company s continuing effort to localize products for new international markets  as well as customization of products for new strategic partners and new product development  particularly cti related products 
during  the company made several significant product announcements including the introduction of message integration for the novell groupwise client server e mail system  viewmail for microsoft messaging and multilingual telanophy products for the desktop 
the company also completed development and began shipping the industry s first commercially available voice processing systems with an html based hypertext markup language interface 
the new replay and replay plus graphical html interfaces enable system managers to administer voice mail using microsoft explorer or netscape navigator web browsers 
the html interface also greatly simplifies product localization for global markets 
sales and marketing change change dollars in thousands sales and marketing    percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal most of the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended march  when compared to the prior year is due to overall increased compensation related expenses and the addition of new personnel  particularly technical and strategic partner support staff 
the increase in technical support personnel is attributable to the demand for network and desktop support resources as a result of the product shift to repartee and cti offerings 
a increase in unit volume has also caused expenses to be higher when compared to the prior year  as more resources have been devoted to supporting a larger number of systems 
trade show expenditures and other promotional efforts also increased in an effort to establish awareness of the new lingo and repartee products  as well as pronexus visual basic application tools 
sales and marketing expenses include both costs that are essentially fixed as well as costs that vary from period to period relative to sales volume and thus can be expected to fluctuate both in dollar amount and as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended march  from the prior year was attributable to increased compensation related expenses associated with growth in sales and marketing personnel and increased commission expense due to higher sales levels 
the increase in sales and marketing personnel primarily reflected additions to the company s international sales force  and to a lesser extent  additional product support representatives 
increased promotional costs  including promotional literature  trade show attendance and related travel costs  regional marketing presentations  and a targeted incentive program for customer sales representatives  also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative change change dollars in thousands general and administrative    percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal approximately two thirds of the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended march  can be attributed to increased headcount and additional compensation related expenses  and one fourth the result of increased consulting services 
these additional expenses are primarily associated with the company s continued investment in its management information systems infrastructure 
specifically  in fiscal the company upgraded and standardized many of its in house computer systems and network equipment  as well as implemented a new customer management software program 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable due to improved collection statistics 
general and administrative expenses can be expected to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended march  was attributable to higher compensation related expenses due to an approximate increase in administrative personnel and due to increased usage of temporary staffing and consulting services 
general and administrative expenses  being relatively fixed in nature  decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the company s ability to leverage these costs over a growing revenue base 
non recurring charge for purchased  in process research and development during january  the company recognized a non recurring charge of million for purchased  in process research and development as a result of the acquisition of a majority interest in pronexus inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income change change dollars in thousands interest income fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income during fiscal was primarily attributable to lower average invested cash and marketable security balances 
average cash and marketable security balances decreased due to increased inventory holdings  vendor prepayments and certain business combinations 
refer to liquidity and capital resources below 
fiscal compared to fiscal interest income increased during fiscal primarily due to higher average cash and marketable securities balances during the year and to a lesser extent  higher average yields earned on investments due to increasing market interest rates 
average cash and marketable securities balances declined in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of the pronexus acquisition 
income tax benefit provision change change dollars in thousands income tax   effective tax rate variations in the customary relationship between the income tax benefit provision and the statutory income tax rate of result from tax exempt investment income  research and development tax credits  the benefit provided by the company s foreign sales corporation fsc and certain nondeductible expenses 
the company expects the effective tax rate to fluctuate in the future due to the impact of changing research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest income  and foreign sales corporation benefits as a percentage of taxable income 
in addition  the company anticipates that its operations may fall under the jurisdiction of additional taxing authorities as its operations continue to expand into new geographical areas 
fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the company s pretax loss  the company will receive a refund of income taxes previously paid 
the company s effective tax rate increased to benefit rate as a result of a pretax loss in fiscal from in fiscal the significant increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the company s small pretax loss in fiscal as the company s operating results approach the break even level as in fiscal  the tax benefits provided by tax exempt income  the fsc and the research and development tax credit increase as a percentage of the pretax operating result even though the absolute dollar value of these benefits has not significantly changed 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the non recurring charge for purchased  in process research and development associated with the pronexus transaction  which is not deductible for income tax purposes 
the effect of the non recurring charge was partially offset by increases in non taxable income and research credits as a percentage of taxable income 
net income and earnings per share change change dollars in thousands  except per share data net income   percentage of net sales earnings per share basic diluted fiscal compared to fiscal net income and earnings per share in fiscal decreased compared to due primarily to increased operating expenses  as discussed under the individual income statement captions 
the company believes these investments are essential to prepare for new product direction and future growth 
this investment in the development of new offerings and distribution channels  and the individuals that support them  is expected to continue throughout the next fiscal year 
furthermore  the decline in gross margin percentage  combined with relatively modest increases in sales volume to leverage over the added operating expenses  has contributed to the decrease 
the average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the two periods was comparable 
fiscal compared to fiscal the decreases in net income and earnings per share for the year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to a decline in gross margin to in from in and the non recurring charge for purchased  in process research and development associated with the pronexus acquisition  as discussed above 
in addition  operating expenses as a percent of net sales excluding the non recurring charge increased to of net sales compared to of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
the average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the two periods was comparable 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities decreased to million  or of total assets  at march  from million  or of total assets  at march  the majority of the decrease is due to increases in inventory levels and vendor prepayments  as well as purchases of hardware and software equipment to augment the company s management information systems 
the company had working capital of million at march  accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased to million at march  from million at march   due to higher sales levels and an approximate increase of in days sales outstanding 
the increase in inventory levels to million at march  from million at march  is attributable to lower than expected fourth quarter sales due to the delay in releasing repartee  as well as an initial stocking order for the lingo product 
in fiscal  the company made a one time vendor prepayment of approximately  to secure future inventory deliveries at a favorable discount price 
also  to accommodate increased development personnel  the company effectively incurred approximately  of prepaid rent by paying certain architectural fees and costs on behalf of the lessor in exchange for reduced future lease payments on new office space 
the company made million in capital expenditures during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal consisted of the aforementioned investment in management information system hardware  which includes new workstations and equipment  as well as a customer management software program 
during september  the company acquired its european distributor active voice bv based in the netherlands 
the purchase price of  was paid in cash and the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting 
the company currently has no specific commitments with respect to additional capital expenditures during fiscal  but expects to spend an aggregate of approximately million for the year 
the company has a  revolving credit line from a bank for financing working capital 
as a result of the current year operating loss  the company was not in compliance with its ebitda covenant at march   even though there were no outstanding borrowings at that date 
the company has obtained a waiver of this covenant from the bank through june  the company believes that ongoing maturity of securities in its investment portfolio  together with cash flow from operations will provide sufficient working capital for use in operations for at least the next year 
impact of the year issue the company has developed plans to make its systems and products year compliant 
the company has and will continue to make certain investments to modify or convert its internal operational software and hardware systems and applications to ensure that the company s systems are year compliant 
although the company expects some costs associated with the modifications and conversions  the financial impact to the company has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the company also is implementing programs for assisting customers to obtain year compliance either by making software upgrades available or offering programs for migrations to current product versions 
the costs incurred in connection with these programs are not expected to be material 
however  if any necessary modifications  conversions  migrations or upgrades are not made  or not made in a timely or cost effective manner  the company or its customers may be unable to implement appropriate year solutions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  if other companies with which the company does business do not address year issues on a timely basis  it could have an adverse effect on the company s systems or business transactions 
factors affecting future operating results certain statements contained herein are dependent upon numerous factors  circumstances and contingencies 
the following factors  while not all inclusive  could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated competitive pressure from new entrants to the cti market  including large software companies and telephone switch manufacturers with greater resources  could adversely affect the company s business 
introduction of new products by the company or its competitors and the extent of their success or failure could produce significant fluctuations in market demand for the company s products 
increasing price competition in the company s marketplace could influence the amount and timing of changes in the company s prices to its customers  and therefore negatively impact the company s gross margins 
gross margins may also either increase or decrease as a result of further shifts in product mix depending upon the percentage of net sales contributed by software only sales in comparison to turnkey system sales 
the extent and timing of new product development and the need or desire to modify existing products may cause notable increases in research and development spending 
increasing international sales may require notable increases in development spending associated with localization of products for foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that new products will not be delayed  allowing competitors to gain market share or that such products will be successful in the marketplace 
if the company experiences delays in shipments whether it is due to delays from customers or as a result of the timing of new product introductions by the company in a given quarter  or if new order bookings do not meet anticipated levels  substantial fluctuations in operating results will occur 
frequently  these developments may not become apparent to the company until near or at the end of the quarter 
in addition  changes in the product and channel mix  and the timing of customer orders  will continue to affect the variability of quarterly results of operations in future quarters 
dependence on continued sales to significant customers could have a significant impact on the company s operations as there is no assurance that any particular customer will continue to purchase similar volumes of the company s products 
risks associated with the company s movement into the larger end user market  such as product acceptance and demand and failure to attract sufficient market share  could affect the company s future performance 
growth strategies involving acquisitions and strategic relationships may encounter legal and or unforeseeable delays beyond the company s control 
risks associated with foreign operations such as gains and losses on the conversion of foreign currencies to us dollars  export import regulations  customs matters  foreign collection problems  and military  political and transportation risks may significantly affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s international sales involve risks associated with governmental regulation  product adaptation to local languages and switching systems  and uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations
