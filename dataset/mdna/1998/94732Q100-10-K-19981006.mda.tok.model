certain reclassifications have been made in the following discussion and analysis to present results of operations on a consistent basis 
results of operations net income for was million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million  compared to net income for of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million 
excluding the effect of the sale of mcms  net sales in were million lower than primarily as a result of lower sales of spectek semiconductor memory products and slightly lower sales of the company s pc systems 
the company s overall gross margin percentage declined to in from in primarily as a result of a decrease in gross margin percentage realized from the company s pc operation and lower margins realized from the company s spectek operation 
on february   the company completed the sale of of its interest in mcms  inc mcms  formerly micron custom manufacturing services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in exchange for the interest in mcms  the company received million in cash 
results of operations of the company for include a pre tax gain of million million or per diluted share  after taxes 
the company s financial statements include the results of mcms operation through the date of sale 
net sales of mcms in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
results of operations for include significant operating losses from the company s pc operation primarily due to significantly higher operating expenses  including higher advertising  personnel costs and technical and professional fees  and to a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales 
as part of a plan to lower the company s overall cost structure and to allow the company to price its products more competitively  in february  the company announced it had taken several actions to realign the company to concentrate on its core markets and customers  including the consolidation of its domestic and international operations and the reduction of approximately of its workforce 
as a result of these actions and the continued focus by the company on achieving operational efficiencies  the company has experienced improvement in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in the level of its operating expenses and in the gross margin percentage realized on sales of pc systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal were lower than the second quarter of fiscal and were lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired netframe systems incorporated netframe for million in cash 
the acquisition adversely affected the company s net income in by million  or per diluted share  which included the operating losses of netframe since the acquisition date and a one time charge of million for the write off of purchased in process research and development 
net sales the following table summarizes the company s net sales by product line amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    spectek memory products    contract manufacturing    total net sales    personal computer systems 
net sales of pc systems were lower in compared to primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices for the company s pc systems partially offset by an increase in unit sales and a higher level of non system revenue 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily attributable to a decrease in the selling prices for the company s desktop pc systems and a decline in selling prices for notebook systems 
lower prices were largely the result of industry price competitiveness  particularly for notebook products  and to the company s efforts to price its products more in line with its competition 
unit sales were higher in compared to due primarily to a increase in unit sales of the company s notebook products 
unit sales of pc systems were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter primarily due to a increase in desktop unit sales and a increase in server unit sales  partially offset by a decline in unit sales of notebooks 
unit sales of desktop systems were of total unit sales in compared to in and in unit sales of notebook systems were of total unit sales in compared to and of total pc system sales during and  respectively 
unit sales of pc systems incorporating intel pentium ii microprocessors and pentium microprocessors with mmx technology represented and  respectively of total pc units sold in  compared to and  respectively  of total pc units sold in unit sales of the company s pc systems incorporating intel pentium ii microprocessors were of total units sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales of pc systems to the commercial segment were higher in compared to while sales to the consumer segment were lower 
sales in the company s other market segments were essentially flat in compared to the growth in commercial sales was largely attributable to a more focused effort on behalf of the company s sales force directed toward commercial customers 
international sales of pc systems represented of total pc system sales in compared to in sales to the public segment as a percentage of total net sales of pc systems were in both and  compared to in the level of the company s public sales is partially dependent on the buying practices of governmental entities and the company s success in being selected to participate in government contracts in the future 
in particular  the company has been a supplier to a prime contractor to the us air force under the desktop v contract 
the company s sales under this contract represented and of total revenues from sales of pc systems in and  respectively 
the company expects minimal future sales under this arrangement 
in june  the company was selected as a direct supplier to the air force under a blanket purchase agreement 
a significant decline in government sales of pc systems  including those sold pursuant to government contracts  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
net sales of pc systems were higher in compared to primarily due to a increase in unit sales partially offset by lower average selling prices for the company s pc systems 
the higher level of unit sales was largely attributable to significantly higher government sales and unit sales to commercial entities 
although the company s overall unit sales grew by  the growth in unit sales to consumers and to small office home office customers more closely reflected the overall pc industry growth 
in addition  international sales were essentially flat from to sales to large and medium sized business were higher in compared to and represented of total pc sales in average selling prices for the company s pc systems were lower in compared to primarily as a result of the introduction of a number of lower priced desktop and notebook models during the year  general price reductions for pc systems and to increased government sales of pc systems 
the company s governmental sales generally have lower average selling prices than the balance of the company s pc systems 
in addition  average selling prices in were adversely affected by a decline in the value of ram products incorporated in the company s pc systems  partially offset by an increase in average ram content per system 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company decided to discontinue the manufacture and sale of zeos brand pc systems and to close the related manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
zeos brand pc systems represented of total pc system sales in spectek semiconductor memory products 
net sales of semiconductor memory products were lower in compared to  primarily due to a significant decline in average selling prices partially offset by increases in megabits of memory sold 
average selling prices in were lower compared to  while megabits of memory sold in were higher compared to the increase in megabits of memory sold was primarily due to reduced component test times  which resulted in increased throughput for substantially all memory products 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began to transition production to synchronous dram sdram products 
net sales of sdram memory products in represented of total spectek sales of semiconductor memory products and were nearly of total spectek sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as is typical with product transitions  the company may experience volatility in its test times and yields on less mature products  which would have a corresponding effect on the level of output 
such volatility could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
net sales of semiconductor memory products were slightly lower in compared to  despite a decline in average selling prices 
during  the company nearly tripled megabit shipments compared to the increase in megabits of memory products shipped in compared to was primarily due to the acquisition and utilization of additional test and burn in equipment and reduced component test times  both resulting in increased throughput for substantially all memory products 
the company expects average selling prices for its spectek semiconductor memory products to continue to decline 
the company s spectek semiconductor memory products results of operations are influenced by a number of factors including pricing for  and availability of  nonstandard semiconductor memory components 
see certain factors spectek semiconductor memory products operation 
the company and mti are parties to a component recovery agreement  expiring on september   under which mti is required to deliver to the company all of the nonstandard memory components produced at mti s semiconductor manufacturing operations 
expiration  termination or renegotiation of the component recovery agreement could have material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
a substantial majority of the semiconductor components used in the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation is obtained from mti 
in  the company obtained of its components from mti  compared to in and in in  the spectek semiconductor memory products operation obtained substantially all of its components from three sources  including mti 
purchases from sources other than mti are generally negotiated on a purchase order basis and there can be no assurance the company will be able to negotiate future purchases on terms acceptable to the company 
unless the company is able to continue obtaining significant quantities of nonstandard semiconductor memory components from alternative sources  the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation could be limited by the volume of components supplied by mti 
any reduction in the availability or functionality of nonstandard semiconductor memory components from the company s suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

contract manufacturing 
the company completed the sale of of its interest in mcms on february   accordingly  results of operations of mcms subsequent to february  are excluded from the company s results of operations 
revenues from the company s contract manufacturing operation were lower in than in  primarily due to the effects of a sharp industry wide decline in pricing for semiconductor memory products and  to a lesser extent  a shift in product mix  which were partially offset by a higher level of demand for more complex products 
gross margin amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    spectek memory products    contract manufacturing    total gross margin    personal computer systems 
the company s gross margin on sales of pc systems was million lower in compared to principally due to generally a lower gross margin percentage realized on pc system sales 
the gross margin percentage for sales of the company s pc systems decreased in compared to primarily as a result of losses and lower margins realized on sales of the company s notebook systems in the first two quarters of fiscal and to losses realized from disposition of pc component inventories 
as a result of intense price pressure on notebook products during the year  the company s gross margins in were adversely affected by significantly lower gross margins realized from sales of the company s notebook products 
the company s gross margin in was favorably affected  however  by an adjustment made in the fourth quarter of approximately million related to revisions of estimates for certain contingencies for product and process technology costs 
absent this adjustment  the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales of pc systems in and the fourth quarter of fiscal would have been approximately and  respectively 
the company continues to experience significant pressure on its gross margins as a result of intense competition in the pc industry  consumer expectations of more powerful pc systems at lower prices and the relatively recent introduction and proliferation of products in the sub  pc market 
in addition  the company s gross margin percentage will continue to depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage its inventories of pc system components 
see certain factors personal computer systems competition in the pc industry and certain factors personal computer systems inventory management 
the company s gross margin on sales of pc systems was million or higher in compared to principally due to the higher level of net sales of pc systems and a generally higher gross margin percentage realized on pc system sales 
the gross margin percentage for sales of the company s pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of improved component costs partially offset by lower selling prices for the company s pc systems 
although gross margins increased in  they were adversely affected by intense price competition  an increase in the sales of  and a shift in product mix toward  the company s lower end pc systems 
gross margin as a percent of net sales of pc systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal benefited from an adjustment of million relating to revisions in estimates for certain contingencies for product and process technology costs 
spectek semiconductor memory products 
the gross margin percentage realized by the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation was lower in compared primarily due to significantly lower average selling prices 
average selling prices in were lower compared to the company expects average selling prices for its spectek semiconductor memory products to continue to decline 
as a result  the gross margin for the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation could decline further and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
see certain factors spectek semiconductor memory products operation pricing of semiconductor memory products 
the gross margin percentage realized by the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation was higher in compared to primarily due to lower costs of components  particularly those obtained from mti 
effective at the beginning of  the company modified its agreement for purchasing semiconductor memory components from mti 
under the prior agreement  the company s costs of components were generally equal to one half the price realized from sales of such components 
in  the company s costs of components were generally equal to one half of the net operating income generated from sales of such components 
see certain factors spectek semiconductor memory products operation dependence on component recovery agreement with mti 
contract manufacturing 
the company completed the sale of of its interest in mcms on february   accordingly  results of operations of mcms subsequent to february  are excluded from the company s results of operations 
the gross margin percentage realized from the company s contract manufacturing operation was higher in compared to primarily as a result of an increase in the overall complexity of the printed board assemblies produced by the company and an increase in revenues derived from services utilizing consigned inventory components 
such assembly services generally had a higher gross margin percentage than the balance of the company s contract manufacturing services 
selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative    as a of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were higher in compared to and in compared to primarily due to higher levels of personnel costs and advertising associated with the company s pc operations and higher technical and professional fees primarily associated with information technology consulting services

the company expects to adopt the provisions of sop in its fiscal and adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
certain factors in addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this form k and in other company filings with the securities and exchange commission  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the historical results of the company s operations or those results or events contemplated in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
general fluctuations in operating results and stock price the company s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  industry competition  the company s ability to accurately forecast demand and selling prices for its pc products  fluctuating market pricing for pcs and semiconductor memory products  seasonal government purchasing cycles  inventory obsolescence  the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels  changes in product mix  manufacturing and production constraints  fluctuating component costs  the effects of product reviews and industry awards  availability and pricing of the memory components used by the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation  critical component availability  seasonal cycles common in the pc industry  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors and global market and economic conditions 
as a result  the operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
the trading price of the common stock of the company is subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and financial performance of the company  mti and other companies in the pc industry  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or new strategies by competitors  component availability and pricing  and other factors 
management the company has experienced increased complexity of its operations  in operating and financial information systems and in its scope of operations 
this increased complexity has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for the company s management and has placed  and continues to place  significant demands upon the company s management  operating and financial information systems and other resources and systems 
in addition  during the past year  the company underwent numerous changes in its management structure and reduced its workforce 
the company continues to consider various expansion alternatives  including expansion of facilities  acquisition or establishment of facilities in new geographic regions and certain strategic relationships 
the company recently initiated a reorganization of its operation along its customer segments 
there can be no assurance that the company s management resources  operating and financial information systems and other resources  and systems will be adequate to support the company s existing or future operations  the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
intellectual property matters it is common in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and pc manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology used by the company may infringe on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company evaluates all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  seeks to obtain licenses for the continued use of such technology 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement prior to the balance sheet date 
the company would be placed at a competitive disadvantage if it were unable to obtain such licenses upon terms at least as favorable as those experienced by the company s competitors 
the company has entered into several intellectual property license agreements  and as a majority owned subsidiary of mti  is licensed under certain license agreements between mti and third parties 
the company s rights under license agreements between mti and third parties may terminate in the event that the company is no longer a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
intellectual property agreements and license agreements generally require one time or periodic royalty payments and are subject to expiration at various times 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in their products or processes  the company may be forced to market products without certain technological features or software  discontinue sales of certain of its products and or defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the inability of the company to obtain licenses necessary to use certain technology  or an inability to obtain such licenses on competitive terms  or any litigation determining that the company  in the manufacture or sale of its products  has infringed on the intellectual property rights of third parties  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
mti ownership of common stock of the company as of september   mti owned of the company s outstanding common stock 
in addition  three of the five directors of the company are also directors of mti  including steven r 
appleton  chairman and chief executive officer of mti 
so long as mti continues to own a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company  mti will have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  and generally will have the ability to control the management and certain financial and other affairs of the company 
termination or modification of certain of the company s arrangements with mti resulting in terms less favorable to the company could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in the event that mti s ownership of the company were to decrease below certain levels  certain arrangements may be terminated by mti  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see intellectual property matters and spectek semiconductor memory products operation dependence on component recovery agreement with mti 
the level of mti s ownership of the common stock of the company may limit the company s ability to complete future equity financings 
in addition  the sale on the open market of substantial amounts of shares of common stock of the company currently held by mti could adversely affect the prevailing market price of common stock of the company 
mti s ability to sell shares of common stock of the company  unless registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  is subject to volume and other restrictions pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act 
on october   the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing for the issuance from time to time by the company of debt and or equity securities with a value of up to million  of which million has been issued 
the registration statement also allows for an additional million of outstanding common stock of the company to be sold by certain existing shareholders  consisting of mti and certain management employees  of which million has been sold 
dependence on key personnel the future success of the company will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
there is competition for such personnel in the electronics industries  and the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  and information technology  engineering and technical support resources  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not lose key personnel or that the loss of any key personnel will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
year the year presents issues because many computer hardware and software systems use only the last two digits to refer to a calendar year 
consequently  these systems may fail to process dates after december   which may cause system failures 
in  the company established a year project team with representatives from all of the company s business units 
the company is currently in the process of assessing the year readiness of the hardware associated with its internal information technology systems  as well as embedded technology associated with its manufacturing and physical facilities 
the company anticipates completion of this evaluation in the fourth calendar quarter of additionally  the software utilized on information technology systems within the company has previously been evaluated 
where necessary  appropriate remediation efforts have or will be undertaken 
the company expects to successfully implement necessary modifications of its internal systems to address year issues 
however  if necessary modifications are not made on a timely basis  year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
in addition to internal year readiness efforts  the company is in process of contacting its key suppliers to assess their compliance 
it is anticipated that this assessment process can be substantially completed by the end of calendar year the company anticipates that its actions will minimize risks to the company which might arise from failure of such suppliers to adequately address year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the failure of suppliers to address year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
commencing in the first calendar quarter of  the company plans to develop a contingency plan designed to address problems which might arise from the failure of the company or its suppliers to timely and adequately address year issues 
through the end of fiscal  the company has incurred incremental costs of approximately million related to year assessment and remediation efforts 
the total estimated cost to complete the company s internal readiness program is from million to million 
this estimate  which does not include any costs which may be incurred by the company if its key suppliers fail to timely address year issues  is based on currently known circumstances and various assumptions regarding future events 
the actual cost of year assessment and remediation efforts could differ materially from the estimate 
the company believes that it is not legally responsible for any costs incurred by customers to address year issues 
however  the company recognizes the potential for claims against it and other manufacturers arising from products which are not year compliant  and there can be no assurance that such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
government regulation the company is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  federal communications commission regulations  governmental procurement regulations  import and export regulations  federal trade commission regulations  securities regulations  environmental regulations  antitrust regulations  and labor regulations 
any failure by the company to comply with such regulations in the past  present or future could subject the company to liabilities and or the suspension of its operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
personal computer systems competition the pc industry is highly competitive and has been characterized by intense pricing pressure  generally low gross margin percentages  rapid technological advances in hardware and software  frequent introduction of new products  and rapidly declining component costs 
competition in the pc industry is based primarily upon brand name recognition  performance  price  reliability and service and support 
the company s sales of pc systems have historically benefited from increased name recognition and market acceptance of the company s pc systems  primarily resulting from the receipt by the company of awards from trade publications recognizing the price and performance characteristics of micron brand pc systems and the company s service and support functions 
as a result of pc industry standards  the company and its competitors use many of the same components  typically from the same set of suppliers  which limits the company s ability to technologically and functionally differentiate its products 
many of the company s pc competitors have greater brand name recognition and market share  offer broader product lines  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  the company s competitors may benefit from component volume purchasing and product and process technology license arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and availability than the company s arrangements 
in addition  the company may be at a relative cost disadvantage to certain of its competitors as a result of the company s us dollar denominated purchases of pc components during a period of relative weakening of the us dollar 
the failure of the company to compete effectively in the marketplace could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company competes with a number of pc manufacturers  which sell their products primarily through direct channels  including dell computer  inc and gateway  inc the company also competes with pc manufacturers  such as apple computer  inc  compaq computer corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  nec corporation and toshiba corporation among others  which have traditionally sold their products through national and regional distributors  dealers and value added resellers  retail stores and direct sales forces 
in addition  the company expects to face increased competition in the us direct sales market from foreign pc suppliers and from foreign and domestic suppliers of pc products that decide to implement  or devote additional resources to  a direct sales strategy 
in order to gain an increased share of the united states pc direct sales market  these competitors may effect a pricing strategy that is more aggressive than the current pricing in the direct sales market or may have pricing strategies influenced by relative fluctuations in the us dollar compared to other currencies 
the company believes that the rate of growth in worldwide sales of pc systems  particularly in the united states  where the company sells a substantial majority of its pc systems  has declined and may remain below the growth rates experienced in recent years 
any general decline in demand or decline in the rate of increase in demand for pc systems could increase price competition and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
inventory management the company s ability to compete successfully in the pc market in the future will depend in large part on its ability to accurately forecast demand for its pc products and effectively manage its pc inventories 
the company s pc operations focus on the direct sale of assemble to order pc systems that feature components incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry 
the company has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  excess pc inventories and inventory obsolescence resulting from  among other things  the company s inaccuracy in forecasting demand for its pc products  the typically longer lead times associated with notebook product supply  the fast pace of technological developments in the pc industry and the short product life cycles of pc systems and components 
in addition  because high volumes of quality components are required for the manufacture of the company s pc systems  the company has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages and other supply constraints of key components 
such shortages or supply constraints have in the past adversely affected  and could in the future adversely affect  the company s ability to ship products on schedule or at expected gross margins 
to be successful in the future  the company must accurately forecast demand for its pc products and obtain adequate  but not excessive  supplies of components to meet actual demand 
the failure of the company to manage its inventories effectively could result in excess pc inventories  inventory obsolescence  component shortages and untimely shipment of products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key sources of supply the company focuses on providing pc systems that feature components and software incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry  which components are periodically in short supply and are available from sole or a limited number of suppliers 
as a result  the company has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages in the components used in its pc systems 
the microprocessors used in the company s pc systems are manufactured exclusively by intel and  from time to time  the company has been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of certain intel microprocessors 
in addition  a significant portion of the ram components used in the company s pc systems are supplied by mti  and the company generally relies on mti to supply the latest memory densities and configurations available 
the company relies  to a certain extent  upon its suppliers abilities to enhance existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to respond to emerging standards and other technological developments in the pc industry 
the company s reliance on a limited number of suppliers and on a strategy of incorporating the latest technological developments into its pc systems involves several risks  including the possibility of shortages and or increases in costs of components and software  and risk of reduced control over delivery schedules  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s notebook products are currently assembled by third party manufacturers 
these outsourcing arrangements and any future outsourcing arrangements that the company may enter into may reduce the direct control the company has over certain components and the assembly of such products 
there can be no assurance that the company s outsourcing arrangements will not result in quality problems or affect the company s ability to ship such products on a timely basis or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
state taxation during fiscal  the company began to collect and remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states 
in association therewith  the company is party to agreements with nearly all states which generally limit the liability of the company  if any  for non remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements effective dates 
management believes the resolution of any matters relating to the non remittance of sales or use taxes prior to the balance sheet date will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
spectek semiconductor memory products operation dependence on component recovery agreement with mti the company has a component recovery agreement the component recovery agreement with mti  which expires on september   and may be terminated by mti in the event that mti s ownership of the company falls below 
under the component recovery agreement  mti is required to deliver to the company all of the nonstandard memory components produced at mti s semiconductor manufacturing operations 
the company s cost of such components generally is determined as one half of the operating income generated from the company s spectek sales of semiconductor memory products supplied by mti 
historically  a substantial majority of the components used in the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation has been obtained from mti 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to negotiate future purchases on terms acceptable to the company from mti after the expiration of the component recovery agreement 
any reduction in the availability of functionality of nonstandard semiconductor memory components from mti could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
mti is transitioning its semiconductor memory operations toward synchronous dram sdram from edo memory products and toward meg from meg densities 
such transition may have a significant adverse impact on the volume or grade of nonstandard memory components supplied by mti 
other changes in mti s semiconductor manufacturing processes resulting in improvement of device yields and or changes in the product mix or specifications of its memory components  or other changes or events at mti adversely affecting its overall manufacturing output  could adversely affect the volume of nonstandard memory components supplied by mti 
there can be no assurance that mti will continue to produce adequate volumes of nonstandard memory components to maintain the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation at existing or historic levels 
many semiconductor memory manufacturers are reluctant to sell nonstandard memory components because such components could compete with their full specification memory components for similar applications 
in addition  some manufacturers are concerned that subsequent testing performed by a recovery operation could reveal proprietary data regarding manufacturing yields and processes 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain nonstandard memory components from semiconductor manufacturers in quantities sufficient to meet demand for the company s spectek products 
any reduction in the availability or functionality of nonstandard memory components from the company s suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
pricing of semiconductor memory products pricing for the company s spectek semiconductor memory products fluctuates  to a large degree  based on industry wide pricing for semiconductor memory products 
the company has experienced significant declines in the average selling prices of its spectek semiconductor memory products as industry wide average selling prices for full specification semiconductor memory products experienced sharp declines 
the company believes that such declines in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products was due primarily to changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products and changes in relative weakness or strength of certain currencies  and the company is unable to predict the impact of semiconductor memory product market dynamics in future periods 
due to increased market risk associated with holding purchased memory components in inventory  the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  losses from write downs of memory component inventories in periods of declining prices 
further declines in pricing for semiconductor memory products would likely result in declines in average selling prices of the company s spectek semiconductor memory products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
memory product transition the semiconductor memory industry is characterized by  among other things  rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  difficulties experienced in transitioning to new products  relatively short product life cycles and volatile market conditions 
during the first quarter of fiscal  spectek began to transition production to sdram memory products 
net sales of sdram memory products in represented of total spectek sales of semiconductor memory products and were nearly of total spectek sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company began the initial phase of its transition to meg memory products during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which will require significant investments in new capital equipment 
during periods of product transition  the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant increases in component test times and corresponding decreases in throughput 
future gross margins could be adversely affected if the company is unable to effectively transition to new products in a timely fashion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments and the majority of its debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  as of september   approximately of the company s liquid investments mature within three months and the remainder within one year 
as of september   the company believes the reported amounts of liquid investments and debt to be reasonable approximations of their fair values and has the ability and intent to hold these instruments to maturity 
as result  the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
the company uses the us dollar as its functional currency  except for its operations in japan
