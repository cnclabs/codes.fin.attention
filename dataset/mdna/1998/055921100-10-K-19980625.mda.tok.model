item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this section of the annual report includes historical information for the periods covered  certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s future operating results to differ from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by the company or others 
it is important that the business discussion at item of this report and historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of such risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions are read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes thereto 
historical information results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to total revenues 
percentage of total revenues years ended march  revenues licenses maintenance total revenues selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses general and administrative expenses acquired research and development costs merger costs 
operating income interest and other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings net earnings  excluding acquired research and development and merger related costs earnings total revenues in fiscal were  a increase over fiscal total revenues of  the increase was the result of a increase in north american product license revenues  a increase in international product license revenues and a increase in worldwide maintenance revenues 
over the three year period ending march   the company s operating expenses excluding acquired research and development and merger costs remained at approximately of total revenues 
net earnings in fiscal were  excluding acquired research and development and merger costs of  net of income taxes 
these results represent a increase over fiscal net earnings of  excluding charges of  net of income taxes for acquired research and development in fiscal giving effect to these charges  net earnings were  in fiscal  a increase over net earnings of  in fiscal historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future operating margins  as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
revenues percentage change years ended march  in thousands compared to compared to perpetual licenses north america    international    total perpetual licenses    maintenance    total revenues    the company generates revenues from product license fees for its computer software products and product maintenance fees for the associated maintenance  enhancement and support of these products 
the company recognized revenues through march  in accordance with statement of position sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa 
effective for transactions entered into subsequent to march   the company has adopted sop  software revenue recognition  also issued by the aicpa 
for further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies  refer to the discussion below and to note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
total revenue growth in fiscal and was derived from continued demand for the company s mainframe products for the ibm os operating system and ims and db dbmss  its expansion of its distributed systems product lines and sales channels and  to a lesser extent  higher growth rates of product maintenance fees 
the growth in product license and maintenance fees was derived principally from existing product lines in fiscal and as discussed below  mainframe product revenue growth was generated primarily by customers rapid expansion of their mainframe based it systems 
distributed systems product revenue growth was driven primarily by increased adoption of distributed it systems  by growing acceptance of the company s patrol application and data management product suite and expansion of the distributed systems sales channels 
product revenue growth was only nominally impacted by price increases and inflation in fiscal and fiscal the company s customer base is diversified  with no single customer representing greater than of its total revenues in fiscal  and this customer base is nonetheless concentrated in the top  it purchasers worldwide and  by industry  in the telecommunications  financial services and other transaction intensive sectors 
the company estimates that sales to repeat customers represented over of total license and maintenance revenues in the periods presented 
product line revenues at march   the company marketed over software products designed to improve the availability  performance and recoverability of enterprise applications  databases and other it systems components operating in host mainframe and distributed computing environments 
the company s mainframe products accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
total revenues from mainframe products grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the revenues from these products are driven largely by the growth in customers processing capacity  as discussed below 
the company s mainframe revenues are concentrated in its high performance utilities and administrative tools for ibm s ims and db database management systems 
the ims database utilities product series contributed  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  and the masterplan product series for db contributed  and of total revenues for the same periods 
combined revenues for these product lines grew from both fiscal to and from fiscal to the balance of the company s mainframe products represented  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the declines in relative revenue contribution by the mainframe product lines reflect the increased contribution by the company s distributed systems products in these periods 
total revenues from distributed systems products grew from to and from to distributed systems product revenue growth was derived primarily from increased market acceptance of the patrol application and data management product suite  the company s significant and growing investment in its distributed systems direct and indirect sales channels and higher distributed systems maintenance fees 
the company s principal distributed systems management product lines are the patrol application and management suite  the bgs best performance management products  the patrol db database administration products and the datatools sql backtrack application and database recovery products 
the patrol application and data management products accounted for  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  reflecting an increase from fiscal to fiscal and a increase from fiscal to fiscal the bgs best performance management products were acquired in march and their revenues will be reflected in the company s financial statements throughout fiscal the patrol db database administration product line  introduced in fiscal  generated and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a increase from fiscal to the company s sql backtrack database backup and recovery products were originally sold by bmc through an exclusive distributorship arrangement with datatools beginning on march  in may  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of datatools and began to more fully integrate the sql backtrack products with its patrol recovery manager product lines 
the sql backtrack database backup and recovery products generated and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting growth of 
the revenues from the company s distributed systems product offerings are dependent upon the continued market acceptance of the company s existing products and the company s ability to successfully develop and deliver additional products for the distributed systems environment 
the company has experienced rapid growth in its distributed systems product lines since their introduction in late fiscal the distributed systems market is highly competitive and dynamic and there can be no assurance that this growth will continue 
license revenues the company s license revenues include product license fees  capacity based license upgrade fees and restructuring fees 
product license fees are generated from the initial licensing of a product and subsequent licenses purchased under the company s per copy  cpu tier based licensing program 
capacity based license upgrade fees are charged when a customer acquires the right to run an already licensed product on additional processing capacity  as measured by a cpu tier or by the aggregate processing capacity measured in mips of all cpus for which the company s products are licensed 
these license upgrade fees include fees associated with customers purchasing the right to operate a product with currently installed additional processing capacity and or with anticipated future processing capacity 
restructuring fees increase the discounts associated with a customer s installed base of products  which  therefore  reduce a customer s future maintenance charges and capacity based upgrade fees pertaining to such installed products 
the company s north american operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
north american license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal increased sales of the company s distributed systems products represented a significant part of north american license revenue growth in both fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  the largest single component of north american license revenue growth was increased license upgrade fees associated with customers future mainframe processing capacity 
increased sales of distributed systems products and license upgrade fees associated with current and future additional mainframe capacity were the largest contributors to north american license revenue growth in fiscal international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal these performances were below the company s expectations 
from fiscal to fiscal  the principal contributors to growth in international license revenues were mainframe product license fees and license upgrade fees associated with customers currently required additional mainframe processing capacity 
from fiscal to fiscal  the largest single component of international license growth was increased sales of the company s distributed systems products  followed by license upgrade fees associated with current and future additional mainframe capacity 
international license revenues were reduced by and  respectively  by the strengthening of the dollar against local currencies from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  respectively  in both cases after giving effect to foreign currency hedging gains 
license upgrade fees for current and future mainframe processing capacity accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the sustainability and growth of the company s mainframe based license revenues are dependent upon these capacity based upgrade fees  particularly within its largest customer accounts 
most of the company s largest customers have entered into enterprise license agreements allowing them to install the company s products on an unspecified number of cpus  subject to a maximum limit on the aggregate power of the cpus as measured in mips 
additional fees are owed if this limit is exceeded 
substantially all of these transactions include upgrade charges associated with additional processing capacity beyond the customers current usage level and or a restructuring fee  and some include license fees for additional products 
in fiscal  and  the enterprise license fees for future additional processing capacity and license restructurings comprised approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the fees associated with future additional mainframe processing capacity typically comprise from one half to substantially all of the license fees included in enterprise license transactions 
the company has experienced a strong increase in demand from its largest customers for the right to run its products on increased current and anticipated mainframe processing capacity as enterprises invest heavily in their core os mainframe it systems 
the company expects that it will continue to be dependent upon these capacity related license revenue components 
with the rapid advancement of distributed systems technology and customers needs for more functional and open applications  such as pre packaged erp applications  to replace legacy systems  there can be no assurance that the demand for mainframe processing capacity or the higher operating efficiencies afforded by the company s products will continue at current levels 
should this trend slow dramatically or reverse  it would adversely impact the company s mainframe license revenues and its operating results 
maintenance and support revenues maintenance and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in the company s software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
enrollment entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems and applications 
these fees are generally incurred annually and equal to of the list price of the product at the time of renewal  less any applicable discounts 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any first year maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
the company continues to invest heavily in product maintenance and support and believes that maintaining its reputation for superior product support is a key component of its value pricing model 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase in proportion to the processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  the company receives higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install its products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees per mips are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
historically  the company has enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for its mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to the company s products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of the company s maintenance revenues 
to date  the company has been successful in extending its traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
at this time  there is insufficient historical data to determine whether customers will continue to accept this pricing model and renew their maintenance and support contracts at the levels experienced in the mainframe market 
interest and other income interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and to a lesser degree  financed receivables 
interest and other income increased by from fiscal to and from fiscal to this increase is primarily due to higher interest income earned on larger invested cash balances 
expenses percentage change fiscal years ended march  in thousands compared to compared to selling and marketing    research and development    cost of maintenance services and product    licenses general and administrative    acquired research and development    merger costs  n a n a total operating expenses    selling and marketing the company s selling and marketing expenses include personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars 
personnel costs were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal and fiscal selling and marketing year end headcount increased by from fiscal to fiscal  and by from fiscal to fiscal the large increase during fiscal was primarily attributable to significant increases in the company s open systems sales representatives and technical sales support consultants 
sales commissions increased in fiscal and in fiscal  as a result of the and increases  respectively  in license revenues 
ongoing commission plan adjustments held sales commission expense growth below license revenue growth in both fiscal years 
marketing costs have continued to increase to meet the requirements of marketing a greater number of increasingly complex distributed systems products and of supporting a growing indirect distribution channel 
other contributors to the increase were significantly higher levels of travel and trade show activity  the accelerated depreciation of certain computer equipment and the opening of additional field sales offices 
research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain the company s data processing center 
increases in the company s research and development expenses for fiscal and  were the result of increased compensation costs associated with both software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits and facilities costs 
the company increased its headcount in the research and development organization by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal the significant increase in headcount in fiscal resulted primarily from the addition of research and development personnel during the fiscal year 
research and development costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the company capitalizes its software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
during fiscal  and  the company capitalized approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs 
the growth in capitalized costs is primarily due to increases in new distributed systems product development 
cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses consists of amortization of purchased and internally developed software  costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of the company s products and royalty fees 
growth in the cost of maintenance services and product licenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in customer support employees and royalty fees  primarily those paid to datatools 
the company acquired datatools in may of refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements and  therefore  reduced its royalty expense significantly from fiscal to fiscal the increase in cost of maintenance services and product licenses during fiscal is mainly due to increases in the amortization of both purchased and internally developed software and in maintenance  enhancement and support activities 
maintenance costs are increasing as a percentage of maintenance fees as the company s revenue mix shifts to distributed systems 
the company amortized   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  of capitalized software development costs pursuant to sfas no 
in these periods  the company expensed   and  respectively  of capitalized software development costs to accelerate the amortization of certain software products 
these software products were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues which would be required for the company to realize the carrying value of the assets 
the company expects its cost of maintenance services and product licenses will continue to increase as the company capitalizes a higher level of software development costs and as the company builds its distributed systems product support organization  which is less cost effective than its mainframe support organization because of the complexity and variability of the environments in which the products operate 
the distributed systems products operate in a high number of operating environments  including operating systems  dbmss and erp applications and require greater ongoing platform support development activity relative to the company s os mainframe products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  product distribution  facilities management and human resources 
other expenses included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance and costs of managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
growth in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to increased personnel costs and higher costs associated with managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
growth in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related infrastructure to support the company s growth 
fiscal year end headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew by from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal acquired research and development and merger costs on march   the company completed the acquisition of bgs 
the company exchanged  shares of its common stock for all of the outstanding shares of bgs 
the company also converted bgs employee and director options into options to purchase  shares of the company s stock 
the company accounted for the transaction as a pooling of interests  in accordance with accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 and recorded a  charge  net of a  income tax benefit  for merger costs 
the company did not restate its prior consolidated financial statements because the amounts of assets  revenues and income of bgs for the last three fiscal years were not material 
during the quarter ended june   the company completed two acquisitions which included datatools and another technology company for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  including direct acquisition costs 
during the quarter ended september   the company completed another acquisition of a technology company for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  including direct acquisition costs 
the company funded these acquisitions primarily with cash and the assumption of existing stock options held by certain datatools employees 
the company accounted for these transactions using the purchase method and recorded charges of  net of  in income tax benefits  for acquired research and development costs 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain technology assets and certain in process technologies for an aggregate purchase price of  including direct acquisition costs 
the company funded these acquisitions with cash 
the company accounted for these transactions using the purchase method of accounting and recorded a  charge  net of a  income tax benefit  for acquired research and development costs during the first quarter 
the company completed various technology acquisitions during fiscal the aggregate purchase price for these transactions totaled  including direct acquisition costs 
the company funded these acquisitions primarily through the issuance of its common stock  and to a lesser extent  with cash 
the company used the purchase method of accounting for these technology acquisitions 
the company recorded a  charge  net of an income tax benefit of  for acquired research and development costs during fiscal income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk management the company is exposed to certain market risks in its normal course of business operations related to foreign currency fluctuations as well as changes in the value of its marketable securities 
foreign currencies for the fiscal years  and   and  respectively of the company s consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
substantially all of the expenses of operating the company s foreign subsidiaries are similarly incurred in foreign currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results are affected by fluctuations of those foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the company has adopted a foreign currency hedging program under which it enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with the objective of reducing its impact from exposure to foreign currency market fluctuations 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are utilized to hedge firm commitments and anticipated transactions  respectively 
principal currencies hedged are the german deutschemark  the british pound and the french franc in europe  and  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the pacific rim region 
while the company actively manages its foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance that the hedges employed will substantially offset negative impacts on its foreign denominated exposures 
based on the company s overall derivative exposure to foreign currency rate movements  a near term change in foreign currency rates  calculated using a value at risk model with a confidence interval  would not materially affect its financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended march  marketable securities the company adheres to a conservative investment policy  whereby its principal concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing its yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated million on march   and were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although the company s portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be realized unless the instrument was sold 
the company s near term market risk on marketable securities was deemed immaterial  calculated using a value at risk model with a confidence interval  as of march  recently issued accounting pronouncements the aicpa issued sop  software revenue recognition in october  which replaces the previous revenue recognition rules provided by sop sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december   which  in the case of the company  is april  the adoption of this sop is not expected have a material impact on the company s future consolidated financial statements 
in march  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this standard requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
this sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage and the post implementation operations stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   which  in the case of the company is april  sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income was issued 
under sfas no 
 all items that meet the definition of comprehensive income will be separately reported for the period in which they are recognized 
the only impact will be that comprehensive income  which will include changes in the balances of items that are reported separately in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets  will be either reported in a separate statement or at the bottom of the consolidated statements of earnings 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which  in the case of the company  is april  sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information was issued in june sfas no 
requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis used internally for evaluating segment performance and resource allocation 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and disclosure is not required in interim financial statements in the initial year of adoption 
accordingly  the company will reflect sfas no 
information in its consolidated financial statements for the march   fiscal year 
the company is currently assessing the sfas no 
requirements 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended march  and this information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the company s quarterly results are subject to seasonality and can be volatile and difficult to predict accurately prior to a quarter s end as discussed under forward looking information and certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results

liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  which represents a increase over the march   balance 
an important contributor to the increase is the company s software financing program  whereby interests in its trade receivables are transferred to third party financial institutions in exchange for cash 
the company s working capital as of march   was  the company continues to invest cash in securities with maturities beyond one year 
while yielding greater returns  this has the impact of reducing reported working capital 
the company s securities are investment grade and highly liquid 
the company had no debt as of march   other than normal trade payables  accrued liabilities and deferred tax liabilities 
stockholders equity as of march   was  the company continues to finance its growth through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  which included an increase in deferred revenue of approximately  excluding acquired deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  primarily related to the purchase of investment securities  acquisition of computers and related equipment  construction of a new building and the technology acquisitions discussed above 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  which derived primarily from the income tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
this benefit  together with stock option proceeds  exceeded the funds used to acquire the company s stock during the fiscal year 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock 
the company s board of directors terminated the share buy back program  prior to consummation of the bgs merger  in march  consistent with the pooling of interests accounting provisions 
prior to cancellation of the share buy back program  the company was authorized to acquire  shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program 
the company continues to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that complement the company s strategic plans 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results this annual report and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of sections a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended  which are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates and would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect the company s operating results and could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf  of the company 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
these important factors  risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those described in the following paragraphs and in the discussion above under the heading business  including  without limitation  the discussion under the subheading competition  system dependence 
the company s stock price has been and is highly volatile 
future revenues  earnings and stock prices may be subject to wide swings in response to variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue and or earnings growth rates  competitive pressures and other factors 
the stock price of software companies in general  and the company in particular  is based on expectations of sustained future revenue and earnings growth rates 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in the company s perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on the company s stock price 
the growth rates of the company s license revenues  total revenues  net earnings and earnings per share  excluding charges for acquired research and development and merger costs  have accelerated over the last months 
the company s current valuation reflects expectations based on these higher rates of growth 
the company may not achieve  in future periods  these relatively higher rates of growth 
the timing and amount of the company s license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
the company generally operates with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
most of the company s mainframe and distributed systems license sales are closed at the end of each quarter  and there has been and continues to be a trend toward larger enterprise license transactions  which can have sales cycles of up to a year or more and require approval by a customer s upper management 
these transactions are typically difficult to manage and predict 
failure to close an expected individually significant transaction could cause the company s revenues and earnings in a period to fall short of expectations 
other factors that may cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues include competition  industry or technological trends  customer budgetary decisions  mainframe processing capacity growth  general economic conditions or uncertainties  mainframe industry pricing and other trends  announcements of new hardware or software products  the timing of price increases and the factors described in this section of the annual report 
the company generally does not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expected results until the final days or day of a quarter 
the company derived approximately of its total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers  approximately of total revenues and a higher percentage of earnings were contributed by the company s high availability utilities for ims and db administration products 
ibm continues to focus on reducing the overall software costs associated with the os mainframe platform 
further  ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to improve its base and enhanced utilities for ims and db to provide lower cost alternatives to those provided by the company and other independent software vendors 
ibm has significantly increased its level of activity in the ims and db high speed utility markets over the last twelve months 
the company has traditionally maintained sufficient performance and functional advantages over ibm s base utilities to justify its pricing differential although there can be no assurance that it will continue to maintain such advantages 
fees from enterprise license transactions remain fundamental components of the company s revenues and the primary source of mainframe revenues 
these revenues depend on the company s customers continuing to perceive an increasing need to use the company s existing software products on substantially greater mainframe processing capacity in future periods 
the company believes that the demand for enterprise licenses has been driven by customers recommitment over the last to months to the os mainframe platform for large scale  transaction intensive information systems 
whether this trend will continue is difficult to predict 
if the company s customers processing capacity growth were too slow and or if such customers were to perceive less relative benefit from the company s current mainframe products  the company s revenues would be adversely affected 
capacity based upgrade fees associated with both current and future processing capacity contributed  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and the charging of upgrade fees based on cpu tier classifications is standard among mainframe systems software vendors  including ibm 
while the company believes its current pricing policies properly reflect the value provided by its products  the pricing of mainframe systems software is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors  including ibm 
ibm continues to reduce the costs of its mainframe systems software to increase the overall cost competitiveness of its mainframe hardware and software products 
ibm also generally charges significantly less for its software products 
these actions continue to increase pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
the company has continued to reduce the cost of its mainframe tools and utilities in response to these and other competitive pressures 
the company s operating expenses are to a large extent fixed in the short term so that the company has very limited ability to adjust its planned expenses if revenues fail to meet expectations 
if near term demand for the company s products weakens in a given quarter  there would likely be an immediate  material adverse effect on net revenues and operating results and a resultant drop in its stock price 
the company s operating margins exclusive of charges for acquired research and development and merger costs have ranged from to in recent quarters  which is at the high end of the range for peer companies 
the company does not expect future margin expansion 
further  since research and development  sales  support and distribution costs for distributed systems software products are higher than for mainframe products  operating margins will experience more pressure as the mix of the company s business continues its shift to distributed systems revenues 
the company has historically realized greater revenues and net earnings in the latter half of its fiscal year  the quarter ending december coincides with the end of customers annual budgetary periods and the quarter ending march coincides with the end of the company s annual sales plans and fiscal year 
for the same reasons  the company has typically reported lower or flat revenues in the first two quarters of a fiscal year than in the last two quarters of the previous year  resulting in lower operating margins in the first two quarters 
the company historically has generated greater revenues in the third and fourth quarters while maintaining lower rates of expense growth and expanded operating margins 
past financial performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance  and there can be no assurance that this pattern will be maintained 
future operating results are also dependent on sustained performance improvement by the company s international offices  particularly its european operations 
revenue growth by the company s european operations has been slower than revenue growth in north america  and in an effort to improve its european performance  the company has recently replaced the head of its european operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in accelerating the revenue growth of its european operations 
the company s operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally 
in particular  the recent asian economic crisis has resulted in customer budget cuts and financial uncertainty 
less than of the company s revenues are generated in the pacific rim region 
in fiscal  the company announced several executive management and organizational changes involving its chief operating officer  senior vice president  research and development  and senior vice president  european sales 
the company may make other management and organizational changes in the future 
organizational and management changes are intended to enhance competitiveness  productivity and execution  however  there can be no assurance that they will produce the desired results 
the company s growth prospects depend heavily on the continued success of its existing distributed systems products  including patrol  the recently acquired bgs and datatools products and those anticipated to be introduced in the future 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which the company operates are emerging  fragmented and highly competitive 
the company has experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with certain of its distributed systems products  and expects to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or distributed systems product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse affect on the company s revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
the enterprise systems management market that the company s distributed systems products address is characterized by rapid change and intense competition that continues to increase as vendors within the broader markets converge 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than the company and greater experience in distributed systems development and sales 
a key factor in determining the success of the company s products  particularly its distributed systems offerings  will be their ability to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading database management systems and other systems software products supported by the company s products 
maintaining this interoperability has greatly increased the complexity and cost of the company s product development and support activities 
while the company believes its products that address this market  including those under development  will compete effectively  this market will be relatively unpredictable over the next few years and there can be no assurance that anticipated results will be achieved 
microsoft has continued its focus on developing operating systems  systems management products and databases that will provide business critical levels of functionality and reliability 
specifically  microsoft is aggressively promoting its backoffice family of software products  including its ms windows nt operating system and its sql server relational database management system  as lower cost alternatives to the unix operating systems coupled with relational database management systems from oracle  sybase  informix and other vendors 
microsoft has significantly lower software price points in some of the company s markets  which could place additional pricing pressure on the company 
further  microsoft could choose to develop competing products for use within ms windows nt environments 
the company has invested and intends to continue to invest in the development of systems management products for ms windows nt and backoffice environments  but there are numerous uncertainties associated with the company s ability to successfully execute this strategy 
litigation seeking to enforce patents  copyrights and trade secrets is increasing in the software industry 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that their patent or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by the company 
any such claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
with the acquisitions of datatools in may and bgs in march  the company has initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products 
in both acquisitions  retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
the company has implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees 
the company has also elected to retain the principal offices of both datatools and bgs and has reorganized the management structure at both of these locations 
the company has not historically managed significant  fully staffed business units at locations different from the company s headquarters 
as a result  the company may experience additional difficulties in integrating its management policies and practices into datatool s and bgs s operations 
the company has lost key employees that were acquired in these acquisitions  especially at datatools 
the loss of the key employees to date has not been detrimental to the company s product integration plans  although further losses could cause the product integrations to be significantly delayed 
integration of datatool s sql backtrack products are critical to the completion of the company s backup  recovery  and restoration strategy 
integration of bgs s best products with patrol is also critically important to the asa strategy 
successful integration of these complex software products having difference origins is difficult to predict and achieve 
there can be no assurance that these product integrations will meet expectations or be successful 
when the company acquired bgs  it also announced its asa strategy 
the asa strategy contemplates the development of solutions suites that will ensure the availability  performance and recoverability of an erp  dbms or operating system 
these solution suites will contain several of the company s existing products as well as those acquired in the bgs acquisition 
the company intends to design these solution suites to provide customers with a common look and feel for all included products 
there can be no assurance that these integration efforts involving separate and distinct products  including those acquired from bgs  will be successful 
also  given the recent announcement of this strategy  the company cannot predict its acceptance by customers 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by the year software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculating using the year date are a known risk 
the company is designing and testing the most current versions of its products to process year data without interruption or errors and believes that these versions are substantially year compliant 
the company may experience migration costs for customers who are not running current versions of its products 
the company is continually testing its products to ensure year support and compliance  there can be no assurance  however  that despite such testing  undetected errors or defects will not exist that could cause a product to fail to process year data correctly 
the company s products are typically used in high volume information systems that are critical to a customer s operations  so that business interruptions  loss or corruption of data or other major problems could have significant adverse consequences to the customer 
at this time  the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with year compliance of its own products 
the company is also addressing the year risk to the availability  integrity and the reliability of its own internal information systems 
the company has a low volume of transactions and operates within a modern infrastructure 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the cost of year remediation will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there are no assurances  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased cost associated with  the implementation of such changes  and the company s inability to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
factors that could cause unusual costs and delays include the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code and other uncertainties 
the european union s adoption of the euro single currency raises a variety of issues associated with the company s european operations 
although the transition will be phased in over several years  the euro will become europe s single currency on january  the company is assessing euro issues related to its product pricing  contracts  treasury operations and accounting systems 
although the evaluation of these items is still in process  the company believes that the hardware and software systems it uses internally will accommodate this transition and any required policy or operating changes will not have a material adverse effect on future results
