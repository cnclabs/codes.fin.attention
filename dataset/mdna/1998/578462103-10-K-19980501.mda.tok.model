sales in the future may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions  the level of spending in the wholesale club environment and changes to the company s existing relationship with sam s 
the retail jewelry market is particularly subject to the level of consumer discretionary income and the subsequent impact on the type and value of goods purchased

the company will continue to focus on developing retail opportunities outside its business with sam s 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decline in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributed to inventory reserves the company has provided related to discontinued and slow moving merchandise  partially offset by an increase in gross margin recognized on sales in certain product categories  and improvements as a percentage of sales in inventory shrinkage and product handling costs 
the improvement in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributed to a change in merchandising strategies at the retail locations to emphasize higher margin gem  gold and watch products in place of other lower margin products and categories

currency exchange gain loss the company has operations in mexico the company supplies selected fine jewelry  watches and fragrances to sam s locations in mexico  a warehouse club joint venture in mexico between wal mart stores and cifra sa and israel 
in israel the functional currency exchange rate between the israeli shekel and us dollar is government regulated and not currently subject to significant currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in mexico  the us dollar is the functional currency since the economy is considered highly inflationary 
the economic and political instability of the business environment in mexico requires the company to constantly review its operating strategy 
if it is determined that the risk in mexico outweighs the long term growth benefits  the company will seek to maximize its return through a divestiture of this entity 
changes in the exchange rates for the mexican peso relative to the us dollar resulted in direct charges or credits to the consolidated statement of operations during a portion of fiscal during fiscal  there was a foreign currency exchange loss of  during  mexico had greater stability which resulted in a gain of  the devaluation of the mexican peso during fiscal resulted in currency exchange losses of  the company manages the mexican peso currency exchange rate exposure to minimize the effect of exchange rate gains and losses on its cash flows through the use of forward sales contracts  generally for periods not exceeding three months

the company is the sole shareholder of jan bell de mexico  sa de sa jan bell de mexico and its wholly owned subsidiary  elico mexicana sa de cv elico 
elico employs individuals and leases them to jan bell de mexico 
elico is taxed at a rate of on net income and jan bell de mexico is taxed at an inflation adjusted rate of approximately of its net worth 
accordingly  during fiscal the company recorded a tax provision of approximately  for its mexico operations 
proposed acquisition in february  the company announced that it had executed a letter of intent to acquire mayor s 
pursuant to the letter of intent  which was signed by mayor s and shareholders owning approximately of its shares  jan bell has agreed to acquire up to all of the outstanding shares of mayor s 
the aggregate value of the transaction assuming all shares are purchased is approximately million  consisting of cash  common stock and the assumption or replacement of outstanding debt 
the announcement cautioned that the transaction is subject to  among other things  the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement  and certain approvals  including those required by the hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act of the company considers mayor s to be the premier luxury jeweler in the southeast and that this acquisition will strategically position jan bell in the luxury jewelry market while developing a growth platform to complement its presence in the wholesale club jewelry arena 
notwithstanding the company s belief that the acquisition will receive the necessary regulatory approvals  the company can provide no assurance that the acquisition will ultimately be consummated 
in addition the company has not finalized its assessment regarding the impact that the acquisition of mayor s would have on future operating results or capital requirements 
liquidity and capital resources as of january  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and the company had no short term borrowings outstanding under its working capital facility 
the company s current million working capital facility with bankboston retail finance  inc and foothill capital corporation expires may  the agreement related to the current working capital facility contains covenants which require the company to maintain financial ratios related to earnings  working capital  inventory turnover  trade payables and tangible net worth 
it limits capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional debt and prohibits payment of dividends 
the company has received a commitment for a working capital facility of million with the right to request an increase up to million from citicorp usa  inc among other matters  the terms and conditions of the facility are contingent upon a successful closing of the mayor s acquistion 
in the event the mayor s transaction does not close  the company believes that bank financing will be available either through modifications to its existing facility or through placement of a new facility see proposed acquisition 
during fiscal  operations provided million in cash primarily due to operating income  the effects of depreciation and amortization  and the significant reduction in inventory 
the inventory reduction in fiscal is primarily a result of management s efforts to decrease its inventory levels through more efficient product distribution and liquidation of slow moving inventories 
accordingly  the company was able to eliminate the need to borrow on its working capital facility 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  primarily for new back office computer systems 
the company s business is highly seasonal  with seasonal working capital needs peaking in october and november  before the holiday shopping season 
during fiscal these seasonal needs were supplied by the company s internally generated working capital 
the company anticipates similar seasonal needs in fiscal in the past the company partially financed its peak seasonal inventory with short term borrowings when necessary 
during there were no short term borrowings required 
during fiscal and fiscal the company s peak levels of inventory were million and million and peak outstanding short term borrowings pursuant to lines of credit were million and million  respectively 
average amounts of outstanding short term borrowings for fiscal and fiscal were  and million 
during fiscal  a dispute of approximately million arose between sam s and the company related to certain wholesale sales and returns  primarily relating to claims by sam s for credits for certain merchandise returns 
subsequent to january   the company received from sam s confirmation that all items in dispute prior to february  are closed and there are no amounts due from or due to jan bell by sam s relating to such dispute 
no consideration was required of the company to close this matter 
the company believes that its cash on hand  projected cash from operations  availability under the current working capital facility and financing arrangements which are expected to be negotiated and finalized during  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that the company s future operating results will be sufficient to sustain such working capital and capital expenditure needs 
additionally  consummation of the proposed acquisition of mayor s or other acquisitions would increase the company s cash requirements 
effects of inflation gold prices are affected by political  industrial and economic factors and by changing perceptions of the value of gold relative to currencies 
investors commonly purchase gold and other precious metals perceived to be rising in value as a hedge against a perceived increase in inflation  thereby bidding up the price of such metals 
the company s sales volume and net income are potentially affected by the fluctuations in prices of gold  diamonds and other precious or semi precious gemstones as well as watches and other accessories 
because of the manner in which the company procures and sells gold products  the company believes that it is not necessary to hedge its gold inventories 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of precious and semi precious gemstones  watches or other accessories 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are directly affected by inflation resulting in an increased cost of doing business 
although inflation has not had and the company does not expect it to have a material effect on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 which supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statements of operations 
basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
sfas no 
had no significant impact on the earnings per share for fiscal  and the company will adopt the following two statements of financial accounting standards during the year ending january  in june  sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  was issued 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains  and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that a company a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
the company has not determined the effect  if any  that sfas no 
will have on the disclosures in its consolidated financial statements 
in june  sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  was issued 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public companies report selected information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those companies report selected information about segments in interim and annual financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
sfas no 
 which supersedes sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  but retains the requirement to report information about major customers  requires that a public company report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
sfas no 
requires that a public company report a measure of segment profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items  and segment assets 
however  sfas no 
does not require the reporting of information that is not prepared for internal use if reporting it would be impractical 
sfas no 
also requires that a public company report descriptive information about the way that the operating segments were determined  the products and services provided by the operating segments  differences between the measurements used in reporting segment information and those used in the enterprise s general purpose financial statements  and changes in the measurement of segment amounts from period to period 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  the company has not determined the effect  if any  sfas no 
will have on the disclosures in its consolidated financial statements 
year matters the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or other equipment or systems that have or rely on time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system or equipment failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others things  a temporary inability to process transactions  and invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has identified and assessed the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the company expects to formalize its plan for corrective action and estimate the potential incremental costs required to address this issue by december the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems software and related computer technologies 
the company also believes that the year issue will not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations  although there can be no assurance  particularly regarding the operations of its vendors and suppliers 
future operating results  uncertainties and risks the future operating results of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including without limitation the following the company markets its products through sam s pursuant to an arrangement whereby the company operates an exclusive leased department at all of sam s existing and future domestic and puerto rican locations through february  the company and sam s each have determined that the present relationship is in need of modification and believe that there is a basis to have a mutually beneficial relationship beyond both the company and sam s are evaluating the mix of responsibilities to take better advantage of each company s expertise in merchandising and retailing 
while the agreement as presently structured will not be extended beyond its primary term  the company and sam s are currently reviewing strategies that could lead to a modified relationship prior to the expiration date 
the company is dependent on sam s to conduct its business  and the loss of the leased department arrangement with sam s would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company is actively pursuing new growth opportunities outside of its existing business within sam s 
management is also considering other growth opportunities and may consider acquisitions of businesses similar or complementary to that of the company  but there can be no assurance that such opportunities will not require a significant investment of funds and management attention by the company 
any such growth opportunities will be subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new product or service offering  including competition  lack of sufficient customer demand  unavailability of experienced management  unforeseen complications  delays and cost increases 
the company may incur costs in connection with pursuing new growth opportunities that it cannot recover  and the company may be required to expense certain of these costs  which may negatively impact the company s reported operating performance for the periods during which such costs are incurred 
the company s retail operation requires expertise in the areas of merchandising  sourcing  selling  personnel  training  systems and accounting 
the company must look to increases in the number of retail locations to occur  thereby increasing the company s customer base  for expansion 
the company must also review other available sources of revenue 
the retail jewelry market is particularly subject to the level of consumer discretionary income and the subsequent impact on the type and value of goods purchased 
with the consolidation of the retail industry  the company believes that competition both within the warehouse club industry and with other competing general and specialty retailers and discounters will continue to increase 
further consolidation of the warehouse club industry due to geographic constraints and market consolidation might also adversely affect the company s existing relationship with sam s and the company s business 
the opening and success of the leased locations and locations to be opened or acquired in later years  if any  will depend on various factors  including general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending  the performance of the company s retail programs and concepts  and the ability of the company to manage the leased department operations and future expansion and hire and train personnel 
in november  the company opened its first jewelry depot store in framingham  massachusetts 
subsequently  the company also opened two jewelry depot outlets in vero beach  florida and in worcester  massachusetts 
the framingham and worcester locations were not successful and in january and november  respectively  the company closed these operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired from andin international  inc its three manhattan diamond outlet locations in the potomac mills  gurnee mills and orlando belz outlet malls 
management believes the remaining four locations currently do not generate an acceptable return on capital employed 
the company will look to either open additional locations in order to achieve economies of scale with respect to the required cost structure or seek an acceptable sale of these locations 
the company purchases diamonds and other gemstones directly in international markets located in tel aviv  new york  antwerp and elsewhere 
the company seeks to meet its diamond requirements with purchases on a systemic basis throughout the year 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of gemstones 
if such fluctuations should be unusually large or rapid and result in prolonged higher or lower prices  there is no assurance that the necessary price adjustments could be made quickly enough to prevent the company from being adversely affected 
further  the continued availability of diamonds to the company is dependent  to some degree  upon the political and economic situation in south africa and russia  which have been unstable 
several other countries also are major suppliers of diamonds  including botswana and zaire 
in the event of an interruption of diamond supplies  or a material or prolonged reduction in the world supply of finished diamonds  the company could be adversely affected 
although purchases of several critical raw materials  notably gold and gemstones  are made from a limited number of sources  the company believes that there are numerous alternative sources for all raw materials used in the manufacture of its finished jewelry  and the failure of any principal supplier would not have a material adverse effect on operations 
any changes in foreign or domestic laws and policies affecting international trade may have a material adverse effect on the availability or price on the diamonds  other gemstones  precious metals and non jewelry products purchased by the company 
because supplies of parallel marketed products are not always readily available  it can be a difficult process to match the customer demand to market availability 
the company generally utilizes the services of independent customs agents to comply with us customs laws in connection with its purchases of gold  diamond and other jewelry merchandise from foreign sources 
the company bears certain risks in purchasing parallel marketed goods which includes certain watches and other products 
parallel marketed goods are products to which trademarks are legitimately applied but which were not necessarily intended by their foreign manufacturers to be imported and sold in the united states 
the laws and regulations governing transactions involving such goods lack clarity in significant respects 
from time to time  trademark or copyright holders and their licensees initiate private suits or administrative agency proceedings seeking damages or injunctive relief based on alleged trademark or copyright infringement by purchasers and sellers of parallel marketed goods 
while the company believes that its practices and procedures with respect to the purchase of goods lessen the risk of significant litigation or liability  the company is from time to time involved in such proceedings and there can be no assurance that additional claims or suits will not be initiated against the company or any of its affiliates  and there can be no assurances regarding the results of any pending or future claims or suits 
further  legislation is introduced in congress from time to time regarding parallel marketed goods 
certain legislative or regulatory proposals  if enacted  could materially limit the company s ability to sell parallel marketed goods in the united states 
there can be no assurances as to whether or when any such proposals might be acted upon by congress or that future judicial  legislative or administrative agency action will restrict or eliminate these sources of supply 
the company has identified alternate sources of supply or categories of similar products  although the cost of certain products may increase or their availability may be lessened 
the agreements related to the company s working capital facility contain covenants which require the company to maintain financial ratios related to earnings  working capital  inventory turnover  trade payables and tangible net worth 
it also limits capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional debt and prohibits the payment of dividends 
there can be no assurance that the company s future operating results will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the foregoing covenants or any covenants which might exist related to new financing arrangements that are currently in the process of being negotiated
