item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to the historical information contained herein  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in factors affecting operating results and market price of stock 
company overview tcsi corporation provides integrated software products and services for the global telecommunications industry 
since its inception in  a significant portion of the company s revenues have been earned from telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers 
since  the company s growth has been led by sales of solutioncore tm and related products and services 
prior to  the company also earned revenue from licensing embedded software contained in wireless products and from the development of system solutions for customers in the transportation industry 
during the second half of  the company divested its non telecom product lines by licensing its embedded software product lines and terminating its final transportation related development agreement 
as a result  in  the company focused entirely on offering software solutions to the telecom industry 
the company provides services to customers under level of effort and fixed price contracts 
service revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of contract costs incurred in relation to total estimated contract costs 
changes to total estimated contract costs  if any  are recognized in the period such changes are determined 
the scope and size of many of the company s system solutions are large and complex  typically requiring delivery over several quarters 
from time to time  customers have established payment milestones which can be achieved only after completion of the related services 
in limited cases  some customers have disputed fees charged for services provided 
although the company was under no obligation to compromise its billed amounts  the company from time to time has reduced its accounts receivable when such disputes could not be amicably resolved 
additionally  a portion of the company s revenues and operating income has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from software licensing fees from a limited number of customers 
the company recognizes revenues from software licensing fees only after delivery of software products and if there are no remaining significant post delivery obligations 
the company recognizes revenues from software licensing fees with significant post delivery obligations associated with the related services contract on a percentage of completion basis 
the licensing and implementation of the company s software products generally involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
as a result  the company s sales process is subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes typically accompanying such significant capital expenditures 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on its customers decisions as to the timing and level of expenditures and resource commitments 
the variability in the timing of such expenditures could cause material fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in this regard  the consistency of the company s and quarterly results have been adversely affected by delays in the purchase of software licenses 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from the sale of the company s software products and services to major telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers 
due to the complex nature of the advanced element  network  and service management systems being developed  successful deployment of these systems often contains significant technological risks 
the company has in the past relied and will in the future rely on its development and implementation expertise 
additionally  development and implementation of these systems often occurs over several quarters 
there exists the risk that a change in a customer s technology or business strategy during such lengthy development and implementation periods may cause early termination of a project or discontinuance of future phases 
in this regard  the company  in limited cases  has experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results on a quarterly basis due to termination  cancellation  or non renewal of agreements 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
the company strongly encourages review of the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
management believes that continued revenue growth is highly dependent upon the development and enhancement of software products that meet market needs 
prior to  the company s product development was primarily funded by customers as part of the development of software applications for such customers 
the company typically retained certain rights to developed software products 
in certain circumstances  however  the company agreed to restrict its use of such products to certain markets and during certain time periods 
during  the company began funding a larger portion of its product development costs 
although management intends to target product development spending at levels consistent with other software companies  from time to time  spending may be greater or less than these amounts  as circumstances dictate 
furthermore  management expects that from time to time it may acquire businesses  products  or technologies to enhance the company s current product offerings 
to date  the company has not consummated any such acquisitions and the company has no current agreements to effect any such acquisitions 
the failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate  and effect such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected income statement data for each of the years ended december as a percentage of revenues revenues services software licensing fees equipment  non telecom costs  expenses  and special items services equipment  non telecom product development selling  general  and administrative non recurring special items  net income loss from operations interest and investment income income loss before income taxes net income loss revenues the company generates revenues primarily from the sale of its services and software products to the telecommunications industry 
in  software licensing fees represented percent and services represented percent of total revenues 
in  software licensing fees represented percent and services represented percent of total revenues 
additionally  included equipment revenues representing percent of total revenues 
the equipment revenues were the result of the deployment phase of a significant development agreement the company entered into in with a transportation customer that included the purchase of equipment on behalf of the customer 
during the third quarter of  the company agreed to terminate this agreement and does not have any other agreements with significant provisions to purchase equipment 
in  software licensing fees represented percent and services represented percent of total revenues 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
the company strongly encourages review of the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
for the years ended december  the revenue breakdown is as follows total company revenues services    software licensing fees    equipment  non telecom  totals    telecom revenues services    software licensing fees    totals    total company revenues decreased percent in to million from million in the decline is primarily attributable to million of revenues generated in by non telecom business units which were discontinued in late total company revenues increased percent in to million from million in the increase in revenues for was attributable to million of equipment purchased on behalf of a customer  as described above 
excluding such equipment revenues  total revenues attributable to services and software licensing fees declined to million in from million in primarily due to the discontinuance of non telecom business units in late total telecom revenues decreased percent to million in from million in the decline in telecom revenues is primarily the result of a percent decline in telecom software licensing fees in as the result of delayed system deployments in north america 
the company expects software licensing fees to vary from period to period 
in  total telecom revenues increased percent to million compared to million in total company revenues from services for the year ended december  decreased percent to million from million in for the year ended december   such revenues decreased percent from million in the decline in total company services revenues in and is primarily attributable to the discontinuance of non telecom business units in late total telecom revenues from services for the year ended december  decreased percent to million compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   telecom services revenues increased percent from million in total company software licensing revenues decreased percent for the year ended december  compared to the same period in for the year ended december   such revenues decreased percent compared to the same period in the decline in each year is primarily the result of the discontinuance of non telecom product lines in late total telecom software licensing revenues decreased percent for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decline in telecom software licensing fees in is attributed to delayed system deployments in north america 
for the year ended december   telecom software licensing revenues also declined percent over the comparable period in telecom licensing fees in included software licensing revenues related to the purchase of the company s development platform in connection with several large projects 
in  the demand centered more on follow on services than on new licenses 
the company expects software licensing revenues to continue to vary on a quarterly and annual basis 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
the company strongly encourages review of the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
for the years ended december  the percentage of revenues by geographic location are summarized as follows total company north america asia pacific europe telecom north america asia pacific europe the and increases in total company and telecom revenues from customers in asia and europe is attributable to continued relationships with existing customers  particularly through nec  the company s business partner in japan  resulting in revenues from follow on contracts signed earlier in the decline in total company and telecom revenues in and from customers in north america is the result of merger activity among the rbocs that slowed the decision making process  low telecom bookings during and delayed deployments in  as the company generally realizes services revenues involving design  development  testing  and deployment over a twelve to eighteen month period 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue in future periods 
to date  a significant portion of revenues has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in   and  total company revenues from the company s five largest customers represented percent  percent  and percent of revenues  respectively 
further  as a percentage of total telecom revenues  the top five telecom customers represented percent  percent  and percent of revenues in   and  respectively 
in  one customer with multiple contracts  nec  represented approximately percent of total company revenues and two customers  italtel and idc  each represented approximately percent of total company revenues 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience significant customer concentration 
there can be no assurance that such customers or any other customers will in the future continue to place orders with the company which equal or exceed the comparable levels for prior periods 
direct costs of services the company incurs direct costs in the development and deployment of its customers software solutions 
the major components of direct costs are employee compensation  subcontractor fees  training costs  and other billable direct costs  including travel expenses 
direct costs also include an allocation for benefits  facilities  and depreciation 
costs of services declined percent to million in from million in costs of services increased percent in from million in as a percentage of services revenues  cost of services were percent  percent  and percent for   and  respectively 
in  costs of services included increased investments in the completion of a number of north american telecom software solutions 
such customer related investments were reduced in the first half of thereby this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
the company strongly encourages review of the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
contributing to lower direct costs of services in in addition  the decline in cost of services in compared to is also attributable to the divestiture of non telecom business units in late equipment costs equipment costs relate to equipment purchased on behalf of a transportation customer 
in  the company had one significant system development contract which provided for the delivery of equipment 
in october  tcsi agreed to terminate this contract 
the company does not anticipate that such equipment costs  or related revenues  will be significant in the future 
product development product development includes employee compensation  subcontractor fees  training costs  and other product development costs  including an allocation for benefits  facilities  and depreciation 
prior to  the company s product development had been primarily funded by customers as part of the development of software applications for such customers 
as a result  internally funded product development costs had not been material 
the company began internally funding its product development costs in the company invested million  or percent of revenues  on internally funded product development in compared to million  or percent of revenues  in in  such costs included two major upgrades of the company s solutioncore product as well as non telecom product development costs from its divested business units 
in  the funds were used primarily for enhancements made to the company s solutioncore product  which includes the fifth release of object services package osp and new releases of related development tools 
the company expects to continue to invest in solutioncore as well as its new components based applications  solutionsuites  in future periods 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling expenses include sales and marketing employee compensation  promotional material  trade shows  travel  and facilities expenses 
general and administrative costs include compensation costs related to executive management  finance  and administrative personnel along with the other administrative costs including recruiting  legal and accounting fees  insurance  and bad debt expense 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to the discontinuance of non telecom business units in late  as well as the company s business realignment decisions taken over the past year 
in  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased percent from million in the increase was primarily due to the expansion of the company facilities  bad debt expense  employee benefit costs  and increased international sales and marketing programs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were percent  percent  and percent in   and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in is primarily attributed to the decline in total revenues for the year compared to total revenues 
non recurring special items the company incurred a charge to operations of million in the first two quarters of resulting from adjustments to the market value of equipment held for resale related to the termination of a transportation contract in the third quarter of the company concluded the sale of the equipment in the third quarter of related to this same agreement  in the third quarter of  the company recorded a this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
the company strongly encourages review of the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
charge of approximately million to cover the costs related to the termination of this agreement 
the customer paid the company approximately million to terminate the agreement 
as part of the company s strategy to focus on its core telecom operations  in november  the company licensed its embedded wireless technology and related product lines to atmel corporation atmel in exchange for atmel common stock valued at million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a gain on this licensing of its technology  net of transaction costs and project commitments  totaling million and a gain of approximately million from the sale of the atmel stock 
income taxes the company records income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was percent for and and percent for in  the company s tax rate was lower primarily as a result of tax benefits from nontaxable interest income  foreign sales  and research and development tax credits 
such benefits were not fully available in and  causing the tax rate to increase slightly 
at december   the company had approximately million of deferred tax assets 
realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain the benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from tax credit carry forwards 
it is management s assessment that current levels of anticipated taxable income will be sufficient to realize the net deferred tax asset 
earnings per share as a result of the new statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
earnings per share issued in february  earnings loss per share eps is computed using two different methods  basic and diluted earnings per share 
basic eps is computed using only the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
diluted eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive stock equivalents from the company s stock option plans 
basic earnings loss per share was   and for   and  respectively 
shares used in the calculation of basic earnings loss per share increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in shares in is attributable to option exercises and employee stock purchases related to the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the share increase was primarily due to option exercises and million shares of common stock issued in the company s follow on public offering in the first quarter of diluted earnings loss per share was   and for   and  respectively 
shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings loss per share increased to million in from million in and million in the calculation of earnings loss per share for excludes unexercised option shares as such shares would be anti dilutive as a result of the net loss for the period 
stock option plans in  the company implemented the provisions of financial accounting standards boards fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as provided in the statement  the company continues to account for stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants 
for the years ended december    and  the company has provided pro forma disclosure of what net income loss and earnings loss per share would have been had the fair value  as defined by fasb no 
 of the options been recognized 
in accordance with fasb no 
 in determining the fair value of the options  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model 
in calculating the value of the options and its effect on net income and eps  management has made certain assumptions regarding the length of time an employee holds the options and the expected stock volatility 
the underlying assumptions are based upon past experience and management s best estimates and are subject to significant subjectivity 
accordingly  the ultimate value that an employee receives and the actual number of options exercised may vary significantly from amounts used in the pro forma calculation 
in january  the company s board of directors approved the repricing of million options granted under the stock incentive plan 
all employees were given the opportunity to exchange their current options for new options with an exercise price of per share fair market value of the related common stock as of january  
these options generally vest percent in january and percent each in january and liquidity and capital resources over the past three years  the company has satisfied its liquidity needs principally through cash flows from operating activities 
during  the company generated approximately million of cash from operations primarily resulting from a reduction in the company s accounts receivable  other receivables and other current assets offset by a reduction in accounts payable  accrued compensation and related balances offset by the net loss 
the decline in accounts payable is primarily due to payment in early of amounts owed related to the company s consolidation of its northern california facilities  and the decline in accrued compensation is the result of reduced bonus and salary accruals in cash flow from operating activities in also included approximately million in income tax refunds resulting from prior year net operating loss carrybacks 
in addition  deferred revenue increased by million in due to increases in advance payments under development and maintenance contracts where additional contract performance must occur before revenue can be recognized 
during  net cash generated from operating activities was million primarily resulting from the licensing of the company s embedded wireless product lines 
in  net cash used in operating activities of million was affected by a million increase in receivables over the prior year 
a significant amount of these receivables were related to non telecom business units 
as in the past  the company s operating cash flows in the future may be affected by fluctuating receivable balances 
the company s receivables are primarily from large  credit worthy customers and  as a result  the company does not anticipate any significant default from a customer s inability to make a payment for products and or services received 
cash and investments in marketable securities totaled million at december  and million at december  during  working capital increased million to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the maturity of approximately million of long term marketable securities which were reinvested in short term instruments and the receipt of approximately million in income tax refunds 
cash provided by financing activities declined million to million in compared to in  the cash provided by financing activities was received as a result of the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in early  the company raised funds through a follow on public offering  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  the company raised approximately million from the licensing of its embedded wireless software in late the company has no outstanding debt 
in  the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  which primarily related to the expansion of the company s united kingdom and tokyo facilities to accommodate additional employees and the completion of the tenant improvements for the company s northern california facilities 
the company expects such expenditures to be significantly lower in the near term 
the company currently has no significant commitments for capital expenditures  although management intends to support operational needs as necessary 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
the company strongly encourages review of the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
factors affecting operating results and market price of stock the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks the company faces 
potential fluctuations in future operating results the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results on an annual or quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the cancellation  modification  or non renewal of service  license  or maintenance agreements  the size and timing of significant customer engagements and license fees  the relative proportion of services and software licensing fees  personnel changes  capital spending patterns of the company s customers  concentration of the company s customers  the lengthy sales cycles of the company s products and services  industry acceptance of the company s products and services  changes in operating expenses  new product introductions and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce  and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  regulatory changes  currency fluctuations  and general economic factors 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
historically  a significant portion of the company s operating income has been derived from software licensing fees from a limited number of customers 
variability in the timing of such license fees has caused and may continue to cause material fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company s products and services generally require significant capital expenditures by customers as well as the commitment of resources to implement  monitor  and test the company s enhancements to such systems 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on its customers decisions as to the timing and level of such expenditures and resource commitments 
in addition  the company typically realizes a significant portion of license revenues in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or after the close of  a particular quarter 
the company s expenses are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenue levels and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
if revenues do not meet expectations  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition are likely to be materially adversely affected 
in particular  because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with revenues  net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future period the company s revenues or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
lengthy sales and implementation cycles the company s products are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
the licensing and implementation of the company s software products generally involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
as a result  the company s sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany significant capital expenditures 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycles associated with the licensing of the company s products is often lengthy averaging approximately nine to twelve months and subject to a number of significant delays over which the company has little or no control 
in addition  the company does not recognize service revenues until the services are rendered 
the time required to implement the company s products can vary significantly with the needs of its customers and is generally a process that extends for several months 
because of their complexity  larger implementations may take multiple quarters to complete 
from time to time the company has provided services to implement certain large projects  and  although no contractual basis exists for the customer to do so  certain customers have delayed payment of a portion of service fees and in some cases have disputed the fees charged 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience additional delays or disputes regarding payment in the future  particularly if the company receives orders for large  complex installations 
therefore  the company believes that its quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition are likely to vary significantly in the future 
acceptance of the company s products  product development risks a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of the company s products and services which provide software solutions to major corporations in the worldwide telecom services and equipment industries 
although many telecom companies currently seek to integrate their business operation systems and network operation systems  there can be no assurance that these or other service providers will continue to seek the integration of such systems or that such companies will use the company s products 
due to the complex nature of the advanced element  network  and service management systems developed by the company  the company has in the past relied and will in the future rely on its development and implementation expertise 
the company continues to develop software products that reduce the customization necessary to fully integrate customers systems 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will continue to successfully develop and market such products or  if successful  that the revenue from such products will compensate for any concurrent loss of development and implementation service revenues 
the failure by the company to successfully develop and market such products and technologies would have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
revenues attributable to the company s distributed object software products and services have in the past accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial majority of the company s revenues 
accordingly  the company s future business  operating results  and financial condition are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of distributed object software products and services in general and the company s portfolio of products and services in particular 
there can be no assurance that distributed object technology will continue to achieve market acceptance or that the company will be successful in developing  introducing  or marketing improvements to its distributed object products 
moreover  the life cycle of distributed object products is difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent emergence of many of the company s markets  the effect of future product enhancements  and competition 
a decline in the demand for distributed object technology as a result of new or existing competing technologies  or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
prior to  the company s product development was primarily funded by customers as part of the development of software applications for such customers 
the company typically retained certain rights to developed software products 
in certain circumstances  however  the company agreed to restrict its use of such products to certain markets and during certain time periods 
management believes that continued revenue growth is highly dependent upon the development and enhancement of software products that meet market needs 
prior to  internally funded product development costs were nominal 
management intends to target product development spending at amounts consistent with other software companies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funding will result in the successful introduction of new products 
customer concentration to date  a significant portion of the company s revenues has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in particular  in  a large portion of revenues was derived from contracts negotiated through a large equipment manufacturer in asia 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience significant customer concentration 
there can be no assurance that such customers or any other customers will in the future continue to place orders with the company which equal or exceed the comparable levels for prior periods 
in addition  the company s customers typically designate one individual to procure network management software 
if any of such individuals were terminated  transferred  or replaced  the company would be vulnerable to cancellation of an order if  for example  the company s competitors had pre existing relationships with such individual s replacement 
as a result of these factors  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
product defects the company provides complex software products for major corporations 
the development and enhancement of such complex software entails substantial risks of product defects 
the company has in the past identified software defects in certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in existing or new products or releases after commencement of commercial licensing  which may result in delay or loss of revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  or may otherwise adversely impact the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
implementation risks as characteristic of companies providing software solutions to the telecommunications industry  the complexities involved in implementing the company s software solutions entail risks of performance shortfalls 
in some cases the company has agreed to accept some financial responsibility  in the form of negotiated penalty amounts  should the company s products not meet specifications or cause customer system downtime 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter delays or other difficulties due to such complexities 
because the company s customer base consists of a relatively limited number of customers  the reputational harm resulting from product defects or implementation errors would be damaging to the company 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
international sales revenues outside of north america accounted for percent of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue in future periods 
the company intends to penetrate additional international markets and to further expand its existing international operations 
the company s international business involves a number of inherent risks  including longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  a longer sales cycle than with domestic customers  potentially unstable political and economic conditions  language barriers  cultural differences in the conduct of business  seasonality due to the slowdown in european business activity during the company s third fiscal quarter  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecom service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs  and other trade barriers 
in addition  access to foreign markets is often difficult due to the established relationships between government owned or controlled communications companies and local suppliers of communications products 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to successfully penetrate such foreign markets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase revenue derived from international licensing and services or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international business  and consequently  on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
international sales also entail risks associated with currency fluctuations 
the company has attempted to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates associated with international revenue by pricing its products and services in united states dollars whenever possible 
the company  however  generally pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies and generally does not engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
upward fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to foreign customers  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability 
furthermore  future international activity may result in foreign currency denominated sales  and  in such event  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
in order to reduce the risk of exchange rate losses from foreign currency denominated sales  the company may engage in hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
dependence on telecommunications carriers  government regulation many of the company s principal customers are major telecom carriers 
such companies operate within the telecom industry  which has recently been characterized by intense competition in the development of new technology  equipment  and customer services 
the company believes that large telecom carriers have become increasingly cautious in making significant capital expenditures  due in part to increased competition from smaller  rapidly developing alternative carriers  decreasing prices for telecom services and equipment  and regulatory rate structures that have become less dependent on the level of carriers capital expenditures 
these and other factors have in the past and may in the future cause such customers to experience significant fluctuations in capital expenditures for network management software solutions 
the telecom industry is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other countries  and the company s customers generally must receive regulatory approvals in conducting their businesses 
although the telecom industry has recently been characterized by government deregulation  there can be no assurance that deregulatory trends will continue or that reregulation will not occur 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the company s ability to attract and retain customers 
for example  regulatory authorities may continue to oversee the pricing of new and existing telecom services  which  in turn impact carriers ability to make significant capital expenditures 
the enactment by federal  state  or foreign governments of new laws or regulations or change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the company s customers  and thereby affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
competition the company offers products and services in the evolving market for telecommunications oss software 
competition in this market is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory requirements  frequent new product introductions  and rapid changes in customer requirements 
to maintain and improve its competitive position  the company must continue to develop and introduce  in a timely and cost effective manner  new services  products  and product features that keep pace with competitive offerings by telecom companies and independent software vendors  technological developments  and emerging industry standards in the development of telecommunications network management software solutions 
the principal competitive factors in the company s market are quality  performance  price  customer support  corporate reputation  and product features such as scalability  interoperability  functionality  customizability  and ease of use 
the company s current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address network management needs 
the company faces competition in each of the three functional areas the company believes are necessary for the delivery of complete network management software solutions development environments  turnkey applications  and custom services 
the company s solutioncore and solutionsuites product lines enable the company to provide its customers with both application development software and telecom applications 
because certain of the company s competitors focus only on one functional area of oss software  such competitors may be in a position to develop competitive products targeted solely at the segment they serve 
these competitors include major communications service providers  rbocs  and equipment and computer manufacturers  each of which may have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution  greater name recognition  longer standing relationships with customers than the company and other resources 
furthermore  many of the company s current and potential customers continuously evaluate whether to design  develop  and support internally the software solutions provided by the company  thereby obviating the need for relying on an outside vendor such as the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to those developed by the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry standards  new product introductions  or changing customer requirements 
rapid technological change  need to manage product transitions the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory environments  frequent new product introductions  and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
this poses substantial risks for the company because the company s products and software solutions typically have lengthy development and sales cycles 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the evolving needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product features that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of these new products and features  or that its new products or product features will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce enhancements of existing products or new products in a timely manner  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the company s products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms and with a variety of databases employed by its customers in their networks 
the company must continually modify and enhance its products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by systems vendors  particularly sun microsystems  inc and hewlett packard company  and by vendors of relational database software  particularly oracle corporation  sybase  inc  and informix corporation  could materially adversely impact the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  the failure of the company s products to operate across the various existing and evolving versions of hardware and software platforms and database environments employed by consumers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the introduction or announcement of products by the company or one or more of its competitors embodying new technologies  or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  could render the company s software products and solutions obsolete or unmarketable 
the introduction of new or enhanced versions of its products requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering 
there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by the company or one or more of its competitors will not cause customers to defer licensing of existing company products or engaging the company s services 
any deferral of license or service revenues could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
protection of intellectual property the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements  and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
to date  the company has patents and patents pending related to its telecom products 
the company expects to continue to file patent applications where it believes it is appropriate to protect its proprietary technologies 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will prevent misappropriation of such technology  and such protections may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to the company s products 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
while the company believes that its products and trademarks and their use by customers does not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that the company will not receive future communications from third parties asserting that the company s products or their use by customers infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of such third parties 
the company expects that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the numbers of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  including meritless claims  could result in costly  time consuming litigation  and diversion of technical and management personnel 
in the event any third party was to make a valid claim and a license was not made available on commercially reasonable terms  or if the company was unable to develop non infringing alternative technology  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  certain of the company s customers regard the solutions provided by the company to be proprietary to such customers and may attempt to prohibit the company from using or otherwise benefiting from certain of the advances made in developing such solutions 
although the company intends to increasingly standardize its integration solutions through the use of object oriented software products  there can be no assurance that the prohibition or restrictions imposed by certain customers on the use of certain intellectual property will not adversely affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or that such licenses will not be terminated 
although the company believes that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance their products in a timely and cost effective manner could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by the company until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed  and integrated  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future growth and success depends to a significant extent on its ability to attract and retain qualified managerial  sales  and software engineering personnel 
the company has at times experienced and continues to experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company s future success will also depend on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
the company has recently experienced changes in its executive management personnel 
for example  the company s current chief financial officer joined the company in november competition for the hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
risks associated with acquisitions the company from time to time evaluates potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products  and technologies 
to support its growth plans  the company may acquire companies that have a significant installed base of products not yet offered by the company  have strategic distribution channels or customer relationships  or otherwise present opportunities which management believes enhance the company s competitive position 
such acquisitions would subject the company to numerous risks  including risks associated with the integration into the company of new employees and technology 
moreover  the negotiation and acquisition of such transactions involve the diversion of substantial management resources and the evaluation of such opportunities requires substantial diversion of engineering and technological resources 
in addition  transactions involving the issuance by the company of common stock or other securities could result in immediate and substantial dilution to the company s existing shareholders  large one time write offs  or the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization expenses 
to date  the company has not consummated an acquisition transaction 
the failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate  and effect acquisition transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
potential volatility of stock price the market price of the shares of the company s common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition  announcements of technological innovations  new products  or new contracts by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to proprietary rights  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in this regard  in late  two lawsuits on behalf of certain of the company s shareholders were filed against the company and various of its officers and directors 
in late september  a class action lawsuit was filed in us federal court on behalf of certain shareholders against the company and various of its officers and directors 
the state actions allege violations of state securities laws during and  and the federal action alleges violations of the federal securities laws 
management believes that the lawsuits are without merit and is contesting them 
impact of year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
currently  the company believes there are no material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which include third party software and hardware technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will have completed the same assessment of their internal systems 
the company believes that its products are fully year compliant assuming four digit entries are acceptable to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
the company s fifth release of osp and the prior release  osp x  manage and manipulate dates greater than december   and will not cause an abnormal ending scenario within the application or result in the generation of incorrect values involving such dates 
additionally  the software will not allow errors or incorrect calculations caused by wrapping the century date  by failure to recognize the year as a leap year  or errors in computing dates 
currently  only the time module of osp is time dependent  and it can represent time to an upper limit of february  it is not expected that the company s products will be adversely affected by date changes in the year however  there can be no assurance that the company s products contain and will contain features and functionality considered necessary for its customers to be year compliant
