the company principally promotes its products through the use of targeted direct mail advertising

the company currently procures goods in countries around the world 
the company frequently introduces new products either through its own manufacturing capability or through purchasing from vendors 
one indication of the company s expertise in the area of product development is the substantial number of copyrighted designs which the company owns 
these designs have been incorporated throughout the company s product line  including hat trims  as a means of increasing its competitive advantage 
results of operations income statement comparison the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income tax net income loss analysis of compared to revenues the company s net sales decreased by to  during from  in this sales decline was a result of the negative forces at the retail level that existed in some of the company s markets as well as the company s plan to achieve greater margins through higher prices which led to a lower volume of sales 
the company experienced reduced revenues of  in sales of western or southwestern related products and  in sales to the retail craft industry 
with the bankruptcy and reorganization of another craft retailer during  old america stores ben franklin filed for bankruptcy protection in  as well as the retrenchment by other retailers  the company experienced another year of reduced sales to the retail craft market 
the company s attempts in cost cutting may have also contributed to decreased sales to the retail craft industry 
for instance  in late  the company terminated its relationships with many of the sales representative organizations that provided sales and customer support to the retail craft industry 
the company assumed these responsibilities directly and saved approximately  in commissions during this was certainly at the expense of some amount of sales although it is difficult to quantify since many large craft retailers prefer to deal directly with the company anyway 
similar market conditions existed for the company in its product lines that were western related 
sales by retailers of western apparel and accessories have generally been in decline since this negatively impacted the company s sales of its products to these retailers as well as its sales to other western apparel and accessory manufacturers 
for example  cushman manufactured and sold fewer hat trims in part because fewer western hats were being sold 
in addition to sales declines due to negative external forces  the company initiated and implemented certain strategies during the year that resulted in lower sales 
prices in lower margin product lines were selectively increased and certain products were eliminated from these lines 
for example  the company s line of products relating to shoe care and repair was reduced by more than one half during the year 
also  less focus was placed on sales involving high volume but low margins such as sales of bulk leather 
these merchandising and pricing strategies contributed to the sales decline by approximately  this decline was partially offset by increases generated in the company s growing line of finished leather accessories and an increase in export sales 
finished leather accessory sales and export sales made up and  respectively of the company s sales during and increased at the rates of and  respectively 
these increases in leather accessory and export sales reflect efforts of the company to introduce new products and seek out new opportunities to sell its existing product lines 
management believes that the financial and operational aspects of the business have stabilized and new attention can be directed to increasing sales in market research has been conducted by the company in order to determine how to better serve some of its core customer groups  and during the company intends to focus on some of the ideas drawn from this research 
the company will also continue to exploit initiatives which were begun in that have required some time to be fully implemented  such as the offering of the company s products in the official boy scout catalog 
the sales of the company are not seasonal 
sales were down approximately in the fourth quarter of from the same period in and were down rather uniformly throughout the year 
it is clear that the company is in a protracted down cycle in the craft and western markets 
the majority of the company s management team has experienced similar downturns twice before in their careers 
through new product introduction and attentiveness to customer needs and desires  the company plans to offset any further losses in sales and position itself to take full advantage of opportunities as conditions in these markets improve 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for as compared to for the difference in the relative cost of sales percentage was principally attributable to i a change in sales mix  in that the percentage of the company s sales reflecting relative lower costs of sales increased  ii management s plan to raise prices and selectively eliminate lower margin items from the company s product lines  and iii direct labor costs that were eliminated due to planned personnel reductions and the settlement of the labor dispute at cushman in october of a lower relative cost of sales percentage meant that gross profit as a percentage of sales was higher for the year ended december  compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales increased percentage points to in from in due to the factors mentioned above relative to cost of sales  the company generated almost the same amount of gross profit in dollars on  in sales during the year ended december  as it did on  in sales during operating expenses decreased  or to  during from  in this decrease in operating expenses was the net result of cost control measures instituted by management 
the specific reductions in operating expenses involved several factors  including the following significant elements i reduced payroll  payroll tax and payroll related expenses of approximately  due to a substantially lower average number of employees during compared to  ii a small bad debt recovery was recorded during as opposed to  of expense for  principally due to  in bad debt expense because of a significant customer declaring chapter bankruptcy during  iii a net reduction in commission expense of  occurred in  due primarily to the elimination of sales representatives in the retail craft market partially offset by an increase of  in commissions paid at cushman attributable to the company s line of finished leather goods  iv  less amortization expense was recorded in as opposed to  principally because of the write down of certain purchased goodwill during  and iv reductions of  or more in each of advertising  corporate fees and shareholders relations  freight  insurance  supplies  travel  and marketing samples 
these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased professional expenses incurred by the company in initial efforts to obtain new financing during other income expense other expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  during the same period in the difference between the two years involved decreased interest expense 
the difference in the dollar amount of interest expense was principally due to the write off in of the commitment and facility fees attributable to the acquisition commitments that expired in july the interest expense that the company could have saved during from decreased levels of debt compared to the previous year  was offset by increased interest rates and the forbearance fees charged by nationsbank 
due to the company s continuing default under certain covenants contained in the nationsbank debt facility  the rate of interest charged by nationsbank increased from an average of the prime rate or less during the prior fiscal year to the prime rate plus on average for provision benefit for income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes was of income before taxes due to certain non deductible expenses totaling  principally comprised of the amortization of goodwill 
taking this into account the company s effective tax rate materially approximates the company s historical rate for combined federal and state income taxes of about 
net income the company recorded net income of  for as compared to reporting a net loss of  during the change in results was primarily due to the factors noted above regarding sales  cost of goods sold  operating expenses and other income expense 
analysis of compared to revenues the company s net sales decreased by to  during from  in the decrease in revenues was primarily comprised of two pieces 
reduced sales to the retail craft industry comprised and reduced sales at cushman comprised 
the company s sales to the retail craft industry and its sales at cushman during were negatively impacted by challenging retail environments in the craft and western markets 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for as compared to for the difference in the relative cost of sales percentage was principally attributable to a change in sales mix  price competition in a very competitive market environment and direct labor costs associated with the labor dispute at cushman 
operating expenses increased  or to  during from  during the increase in operating expenses between the two periods was due to various factors  including i an increase in bad debt expense of  because of a significant customer declaring chapter bankruptcy  ii expenses associated with two new locations  iii write down of certain purchased goodwill due to its impairment  iv increased advertising expense to generate new sales and v an increase in operating expenses at cushman  some of which were related to previous labor problems 
these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower discretionary bonuses and commissions 
other income expense other expenses were  for as compared to  during this increase was primarily due to the write off of the commitment and facility fees attributable to the acquisition financing commitments which expired in july  and an increase in interest expense due to an increase in the outstanding balance on the working capital line of credit 
provision benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes was of the loss before income taxes in  as compared to a provision for income taxes of of income before taxes in this difference is primarily a result of an increase in the amortization of non deductible goodwill 
net income the company incurred a net loss of  for as compared to reporting net income of  during the loss was primarily due to the factors noted above regarding sales  cost of goods sold  operating expenses and other income expense 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during were borrowings on the company s credit facility with nationsbank  the senior debt facility with finova and the subordinated debenture with schlinger  and cash flows provided by operating activities 
while having a negative impact on sales  the company s focus in on improving gross profit margins and reducing operating expenses was effective as indicated by the strong cash flows from operations in the amount of  the use of cash flows from operations to pay down debt is reflected in the improvement of the company s debt to equity ratio from at december  to at december  some of this improvement in cash flow resulted from the company s ability to reduce its investment in accounts receivable and inventory given the reduced level of sales 
accounts receivable decreased to  and inventory decreased to  at december  from  and  respectively  at december  the aging of accounts receivable has not deteriorated and is indicative of managements continued tight credit and collection policies which have also contributed to the negative trend in sales noted above 
even at the reduced level  inventory only turned times during  which is below the ratio of times 
this decrease in the turn rate indicates that further reductions in inventory are still needed as of december  for the current level of sales 
management anticipates the implementation of new information systems will assist in monitoring of inventory levels in the refinancing of the company s debt on a long term basis as discussed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements improved the company s financial position substantially 
for example  the company s monthly debt service requirements are approximately  less than under the company s prior arrangements 
as discussed in note  the revolving credit portion of the senior debt facility  at december  is shown as current because of an accounting requirement when the revolving credit agreement contains both a subjective acceleration clause and a requirement for an arrangement whereby cash collections directly reduce the debt outstanding 
management does not believe that any such acceleration will occur and absent such required classification  the company s current ratio would have been at december  compared to at the end of the senior debt facility is now comprised of a revolving credit facility revolving credit loan and two term notes 
the revolving portion is based upon the level of the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   the company had additional availability on the revolving credit facility of approximately  as the company s sales and operations expand requiring larger investments in accounts receivable and inventory  the company could have almost  in additional funds available under the revolving credit loan 
the largest use of cash beyond debt payments in was for capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the expenditures principally relate to the new computer system presently being installed and implemented  with the amounts relating to i new equipment acquired to open the charlotte  nc sales distribution unit  ii new equipment for the fort worth manufacturing facility  and iii the purchase of various equipment  office furniture and fixtures 
the company received proceeds of  in from the sale of the company s land and building located in tampa  florida 
the company now leases the site for its sales distribution unit in tampa  florida 
the company believes that the current sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to fund current operations and the opening of new sales distribution units 
in  the funding for the opening of new units is expected to be provided by operating leases  cash flows from operating activities  and the company s revolving credit loan with finova 
the company s new financings with both finova and schlinger mature on december  and management intends to pursue negotiations with finova and other potential lenders in late and early to extend or replace the maturing notes 
management believes it will be able to secure the required financing prior to the maturity of these loans 
however  in the event of a future material adverse change in the company s operations  finova could accelerate their debt or otherwise determine not to renew the notes 
in such a circumstance  the company would pursue other sources of financing 
if other financing could not be secured  the company could experience a material adverse impact 
management perceives opportunities to acquire related business in the marketplace due to the fragmented nature of the markets in which the company conducts business as well as due to the competitive conditions of these markets 
the company s present financing arrangements will not be sufficient to make these acquisitions and if any acquisitions are to be consummated  the company will be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
any new financings will require the consent of finova 
the company can provide no assurance that these acquisitions can be made on terms acceptable to the company or that the needed financings to enter into these transactions can be obtained 
year issue the company has developed a plan to modify its information technology to be ready for the year and has begun converting critical data processing systems 
at december   the majority of systems had been converted with total cost to date of less than  the company does not expect this project to have a significant effect on operations nor any material remaining costs to be incurred 
cautionary statement the disclosures under results of operations  capital resources and liquidity  year issue and in the notes to consolidated financial statements as provided elsewhere herein contain forward looking statements and projections of management 
there are certain important factors which could cause results to differ materially than those anticipated by some of the forward looking statements 
some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include  among other things  changes from anticipated levels of sales  whether due to future national or regional economic and competitive conditions  including  but not limited to  retail craft buying patterns  and possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets  customer acceptance of existing and new products  or otherwise  pricing pressures due to competitive industry conditions  increases in prices for leather  which is a world wide commodity  which for some reason  may not be passed on to the customers of the company s products  change in tax rates  change in interest rates  change in the commercial banking environment  problems with the importation of the products which the company buys in countries around the world  including  but not limited to  transportation problems or changes in the political climate of the countries involved  including the maintenance by said countries of most favored nation status with the united states of america  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company
