gross profit from continuing operations increased  as gross margins decreased to from in while selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the prior year

improved margins  a full year of operations at gc thorsen and operating income generated at woods during december were the primary reasons for the improvement 
the increase in identifiable assets for the group was due mainly to the acquisition of woods in december sales for the maintenance products group increased  or

sales for the other operations to be disposed of decreased  or 
the deconsolidation of the schon group and the disposition of b

identifiable assets at corporate decreased during the year mainly due to lower cash levels at year end  as a result of the woods acquisition in december of although the results of these operating groups can be significantly affected by the strength of the general economy  the company believes that it has positioned itself well in segments that can be expanded both externally through acquisitions particularly in the electrical electronic and maintenance products areas  and internally through new products  operational improvements and increased market penetrations 
following is a discussion concerning other factors that affected the company s net income 
gross profit increased  as gross margins improved to from in while selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and increase in gross margin percentage was due to the acquisition of gc thorsen effective march  which provided an additional increase due to having a full year of operations and increased market penetration during  the result of experiencing a full year of operations from gemtex  which was acquired in august and the acquisition of woods  effective december the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is mainly due to the increase in sales volumes during interest expense decreased  from as the company had no outstanding short term borrowings and lower long term debt

provision for income taxes was  or an effective rate of in  and  or an effective rate of in the effective tax rate reflects the fact that the gains on the schon sale were not tax effected  since the losses had not previously provided a tax benefit 
equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates decreased  in due to the gain in recognized on the sale of syroco  inc by syratech  and the tax benefit realized from the reversal of taxes previously provided on katy s share of syratech s income  which is no longer required because of the sale of wsc liquidating and katy s holdings of syratech stock

environmental and other contingencies in december  banco del atlantico  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit against woods industries  inc woods  a subsidiary of the company  and against certain past and then present officers and directors and former owners of woods  alleging that the defendants participated in a violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
the plaintiff also alleges that it made loans to an entity controlled by certain officers and directors based upon fraudulent representations 
the plaintiff seeks to hold woods liable for its alleged damage under principles of respondeat superior and successor liability 
the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of  and is requesting treble damages under the statutes 
the defendants have filed a motion  which has not been ruled on  to dismiss this action on jurisdictional grounds 
because the litigation is in preliminary stages  it is not possible at this time for the company to determine an outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
katy may have recourse against the former owner of woods and others for  among other things  violations of covenants  representations and warranties under the purchase agreement  and under state  federal and common law 
in addition  the purchase price under the purchase agreement may be subject to adjustment as a result of the claims made by banco del atlantico 
the extent or limit of any such recourse cannot be predicted at this time 
katy also has a number of product liability and workers compensation claims pending against it and its subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome for such claims 
with respect to the product liability and workers compensation claims  katy has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent management s best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the means of determining allocation among prps is generally set forth in a written agreement entered into by the prps at a particular site 
an allocation share assigned to a prp is often based on the prp s volumetric contribution of waste to a site 
under the federal superfund statute  parties are held to be jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
the company is also involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental cleanup at a number of other sites which are not currently the subject of any legal proceedings under superfund  including certain of its current and formerly owned manufacturing facilities 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately  at december  the ultimate cost will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matters in which the company is currently involved are as follows in  the united states environmental protection agency usepa initiated a unilateral administrative order proceeding under section of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra against wj smith and katy 
the proceeding requires certain actions at the site and certain off site areas  as well as development and implementation of additional cleanup activities to mitigate off site releases 
in december  wj smith  katy and usepa agreed to resolve the proceeding through an administrative order on consent under section of rcra 
pursuant to the order  wj smith is currently implementing a cleanup to mitigate off site releases 
during  the company reached agreement with the oregon department of environmental quality odeq as to a cleanup plan for pcb contamination at the medford  oregon facility of the former standard transformer division of american gage 
the plan called for the company to provide a trust fund of  to fund cleanup costs at the site 
these funds were expended in the plan also called for the present occupants of the site  balteau standard  inc to provide the next  of cost  with any additional costs to be shared equally between the two parties 
balteau standard has paid the next  and the parties are now sharing equally in cleanup costs 
katy believes the cleanup plan has been successful and has requested that the odeq inspect and approve the remediation work 
katy has received such approval with respect to a portion of the cleanup plan 
further monitoring of groundwater and testing and cleanup of adjacent property may be required before approval can be obtained with respect to the remainder of the plan 
pending such approval  the liability of katy and its subsidiary cannot be determined at this time 
pursuant to an agreement executed in connection with the sale of assets of jei liquidating  inc  a katy subsidiary  katy has agreed to defend and indemnify the buyer of such assets  allard industries  inc allard  in the case captioned united states v 
exxon  et al 
in us district court  us  consolidated nos 
c  c l  c lcas 
the case concerns the disposal of hazardous substances at a landfill site in londonderry  new hampshire  at which jei liquidating inc allegedly disposed of hazardous substances from its manchester  new hampshire facility 
the case arises under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  under which generators and transporters of hazardous substances are generally held to be jointly and severally liable for the cleanup of those substances when released into the environment 
the parties to the litigation have reached a settlement in principle  the specific terms of which are being negotiated in a consent decree 
under the expected consent decree  allard katy will pay approximately  and perform no future work at the site  subject to limited re openers 
in exchange  allard and katy will receive a release and contribution protection 
honeywell inc  a former owner and operator of jei liquidating inc s manchester  new hampshire facility  has agreed in principle to pay  of allard katy s settlement under the consent decree 
pending entry of the consent decree and receipt of a release  katy s liability cannot be determined at this time 
although management believes that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable 
other katy s operating plan of the continuing segments indicates a slight improvement in results compared to those reported in however  the plan reflects lower results in the first and second quarter of from continuing segments compared to the year earlier periods 
the plan for the third and fourth quarter of exceed the year earlier periods and allows for an improved year to year result 
the plan allows for possible loss of business in the early part of in the electrical electronic segment due to numerous product line reviews required by our customers 
the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
this could result in a system failure or cause disruption to operations 
in  the company initiated a process of reviewing its systems to determine whether the year would have a significant impact on the company 
the review process has indicated that all systems are either year compliant or will be within the next year 
as a result of this review process  management has determined that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems and accordingly  all costs associated with this conversion are being expensed as incurred 
some of the statements in this form k  as well as statements by the company in periodic press releases  oral statements made by the company s officials to analysts and shareholders in the course of presentations about the company and conference calls following earning releases  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements
