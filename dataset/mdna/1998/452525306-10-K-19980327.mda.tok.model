research and development expenses that are not supported by an outside source of revenue are the primary cause of the company s loss in the company believes that advancing its research and development programs and incurring the resulting expenses is necessary to create value in its product portfolio by performing early stage validation of its technology 
however  for product development to proceed into more expensive phase iii clinical trials  potential partners or new sources of capital would be required to fund much of the continued clinical trial expenses

approximately  in cash was invested in production equipment and one of the company s joint ventures during the year 
cash used to repay bank debt exceeded cash raised through the issuance of common stock by  in as is the case with most early stage biotechnology companies  the company funds a large portion of its research and development expenses through strategic alliances with corporate partners  federal research grants and equity financing with the prospect of becoming profitable if products can be successfully commercialized 
the size of the company s research and development programs and the speed at which these programs are funded is  in large part  determined by the level of financing completed 
however  during the year ended december   the gross margin from product sales was sufficient to contribute  to the research and development programs after covering all general  sales and administrative expenses 
this  contribution compares to a  contribution in  a  contribution in  a  contribution in  a  contribution in and a  deficit in the contribution from the operating non research and development side of the company s business allows the company to be less dependent on raising capital in the equity markets to fund its ongoing operations

these grants aggregate approximately  in funding for the company s research and development programs 
approximately  of this grant income was recognized prior to  approximately  was recognized in and an aggregate amount of approximately  is expected to be recognized in and approximately  of this  in available funding is expected to support internal research and development expenses  and the remaining  is budgeted to fund development work done by outside laboratories 
the company continues to seek federal research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that it is able to spend developing new products 
on december   the company sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock in a private placement transaction for an aggregate consideration of  the private placement transaction was undertaken to ensure that the stockholders equity of the company as of december  would be above the  minimum required by the nasdaq smallcap market for continued listing of the company s common stock as of such date

forward looking statements the statements contained in this report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve various important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors discussed below 
the company is heavily dependent on the successful development of new products for its future growth 
these new products have the potential to increase the company s profitability 
the company has entered into two joint ventures that began initial and limited commercial sales of new products in first  the manufacturing facility constructed by agricell for the production of lactoferrin is capable of producing product valued at up to  annually at full capacity 
see item business  two joint ventures 
secondly  the company estimates that sales by clearwater diagnostics company  llc of crypto scan tm water diagnostic test could reach several millions of dollars per year if market acceptance can be achieved and maintained 
see item business  two joint ventures 
the ultimate profitability of these joint ventures cannot be accurately predicted at this time 
if clinical trials are successful  sales of travelgam tm and diffgam tm would not be anticipated to begin until approximately the year  due to the complex regulatory process required to obtain approval of these products 
if the products are successfully developed  the company intends to enter into marketing alliances with corporate partners to distribute these products 
the company estimates that any such partner could achieve potential sales of travelgam in the range of  to  and potential sales of diffgam could be approximately twice that amount 
the company anticipates being able to financially benefit from manufacturing and supply agreements  or other royalty arrangements with potential marketing partners 
the ultimate profitability of these products cannot be accurately predicted at this time 
by reducing research and development expenses  the company presently has the ability to report increasing net profits 
however  the company has elected to aggressively fund its research and development programs with the objective of benefiting from the growth that successful new products may create 
the company intends to fund several important clinical trials in that may create a net operating loss 
at the same time  the company is seeking licensing payments for rights to the company s new products under development that  if successfully negotiated  may be sufficient to result in a net operating profit in going forward into  it is the company s objective to enter into an alliance s with a marketing partner s to fund much of the company s research and development expenditures 
it is the company s objective to fund all selling  general and administrative expenses as well as all research and development expenditures that are not funded by an outside source with the gross margin earned from current product sales and from available cash 
if the research and development funding objectives are achieved  the increasing profitability of the company during would principally be determined by the market acceptance of crypto scan tm  lactoferrin and whey protein isolate 
further growth in profitability would be principally contingent on successfully entering into marketing alliances with corporate partners and obtaining fda approval to sell the company s milk antibody products for humans 
risk factors the development of these new products is subject to financial  efficacy  regulatory and market risks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to finance the development of these new product opportunities nor that  if financed  the new products will be found to be efficacious and gain the appropriate regulatory approval 
furthermore  if regulatory approval is obtained  there can be no assurance that the market estimates will prove to be accurate or that market acceptance at a profitable price level can be achieved or that the products can be profitably manufactured 
effects of inflation and interest rates the company believes that neither inflation nor interest rates have had a significant effect on revenues and expenses
