these expense ratios were in  in  and in lower litigation costs at liberty  torchmark s alabama insurance subsidiary  have aided this decline

insurance insurance operating income is the pretax income of torchmark s insurance segment  exclusive of realized investment gains and losses and the related adjustment to deferred acquisition costs 
insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting income and excess investment income  which is the income from investment operations less the interest cost attributable to net policy liabilities 
the following table is a summary of torchmark s insurance operating income

a reduction in operating expenses in of approximately million was also a factor 
the expense decline was largely a result of lower legal and litigation costs at liberty 
in recent years  torchmark has emphasized the sale of life insurance products relative to health insurance because of higher profit margins associated with life business 
also  the greater asset base from the higher level of reserves required on life business allows torchmark the opportunity to increase investment income 
this emphasis is evidenced by the growth in life underwriting income relative to that of health 
in  life underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses was of total underwriting income before expenses  compared with in and in health insurance underwriting income declined from in to in and in following is a discussion of each of torchmark s major product groups and a discussion of torchmark s distribution channels 
life insurance 
life insurance premium increased in to million from million in life premium rose for the year sales of life insurance  in terms of annualized premium  were million in  growing over sales of million 
this compares with a decline in sales relative to annualized premium sold in was million 
annualized life insurance premium in force was billion at december   climbing over the billion milestone for the first time in its history 
annualized premium in force grew in from million at year end annualized life premium in force rose during from million 
annualized premium in force and issued data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but excludes single premium income and policy account charges 
life insurance products are marketed through a variety of different distribution channels 
the following table presents life insurance premium by distribution method during each of the three years ended december  life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    direct response    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    military independent agency    united investors exclusive agency    other    direct response marketing is conducted through direct mail  co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
the direct response operation is a profitable distribution channel for torchmark characterized by lower acquisition costs than torchmark s other agency based marketing systems 
this operation has grown rapidly 
in  it had torchmark s highest growth in life insurance premium in both dollar amount and percentage increase  and accounted for over of torchmark s life insurance premium 
direct response premium was million in  increasing over premium of million 
direct response life premium in grew over premium of million 
direct response annualized premium issued increased in to million 
annualized premium in force grew in to million  after having increased in the increase in life insurance issued by direct response in was a result of several expanded programs  including the expansion of the program that solicits sales from previous inquirers who did not buy 
also  co op mailings were expanded 
the direct response operation is also testing new markets to increase future sales 
for example  the sale of policies with higher face amounts was tested in early with favorable results 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system accounted for the largest portion of life insurance premium income in each of the three years presented  with premium of million representing of torchmark s total life premium 
liberty s annualized life premium in force was million at year end  compared with million and million at year ends and  respectively 
life premium sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  declined during to million and during to million 
this agency has completed the transition from a debit style renewal premium collection system to a direct bill or bank draft collection system 
as a result  the transition away from debit style sales led to a decline in the number of sales agents during the transition period of through new agent recruiting programs were implemented late in  resulting in the number of sales agents increasing slightly from year end to a total of  at year end the number of first year agents increased from at year end to at year end during new training programs were implemented to improve the retention of newly recruited agents beyond their first year anniversaries which should further enhance sales growth 
management believes that continual recruiting of new agents and retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
life insurance is distributed through a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and non commissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and non commissioned military officers and their families 
this business is comprised of whole life products with term insurance riders 
the quality of the business produced by this agency is outstanding  and is characterized by extremely low lapse rates 
life premium income from this distribution system grew to million in premium in rose to million  up million from the increase resulted primarily from the acquisition from another carrier of a block of business with million of annualized premium in force produced by the military agency 
in the past  this agency has produced business through liberty  but beginning in  additional sales were produced by globe 
production in the military distribution system almost doubled in  with sales of annualized premium of million  compared with million in annualized premium in force was million at year end  an increase of over annualized premium of million 
premium in force for rose from million in  largely a result of the acquired block of business 
the american income agency is a distribution system that focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
at december   premium from this system accounted for of torchmark s total life premium 
it is a high margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
american income s premium rose in to million  after having risen in to million 
annualized premium was million at year end  rising in and in sales in terms of annualized premium issued were million in  compared with million in and million in the united investors exclusive agency is made up of w r sales representatives  and accounts for approximately of torchmark s life premium 
this agency markets the life insurance products of uilic  and will continue to do so after the planned spin off of w r 
see initial public offering and planned spin off of the asset management segment on page of this report 
premium income rose in both and  and was million in annualized premium in force was million at year end  growing 
the united american independent and captive agencies represent about of torchmark s life premium on a combined basis 
the exclusive agency had growth in premium in to million  but had growth in premium in the independent agency experienced a premium increase of in with premium of million 
premium from this agency rose in life insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium and policy charges    policy obligations    required reserve interest    net policy obligations 
   amortization of acquisition costs    commissions and premium taxes    required interest on deferred acquisition costs    total expense    insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses    torchmark s insurance underwriting income as a percentage of premium was approximately in each of the years presented  with showing a slight improvement over stronger persistency has contributed to torchmark s life insurance profitability and stability in margins 
persistency is beneficial to margins because it lowers the rate of amortization of acquisition costs and increases profits as the premium life is extended 
persistency improvements have resulted over the past few years from a variety of factors  including the previously mentioned changes in the liberty national exclusive agency marketing system 
another contributing factor to improved persistency in life business is a higher proportion of premium from the military distribution system  which has a very low lapse rate 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its health insurance products through several of its distribution channels 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agen cy    direct response   liberty national exclusive agency    american income exlusive agen cy    health insurance premium rose in to million  giving torchmark its first year over year increase in health premium since health premium declined in from million to million 
annualized premium in force for health insurance grew to million at december   over the prior year end balance of million 
health premium in force declined in sales of health premium  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  gaining over sales of million 
the gains in both annualized health premium in force and annualized premium issued were torchmark s first year over year increases in each respective category in five years 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies include medicare supplement insurance  cancer insurance  long term care  and other under age limited benefit supplemental medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for  cancer  and other health products 
medicare supplement s annualized premium in force was million at december  torchmark s medicare supplement sales and premium in force base have stabilized from the declines experienced in the last few years 
in recent years  pressure on medicare supplement sales has come from federal mandates implemented in that substantially reduced allowable first year agents commissions 
as a result  many independent agencies that previously accounted for most of torchmark s sales of this product left the medicare supplement market  adversely affecting sales 
torchmark has implemented certain measures to offset the decline 
medicare supplement products are now primarily sold by the united american exclusive agency  which is less subject to the financing pressures of independent agencies 
further  very cost efficient sales leads for this agency are provided by torchmark s direct response operation 
this agency also benefits from the low cost  highly service oriented back office administration which frees agents to devote full time to sales 
in the last few years the primary competition affecting medicare supplement sales has come from medicare health maintenance organizations hmos  the managed care alternative to traditional fee for service medicare 
however  during the last year  growing public dissatisfaction with hmo service  and increased federal regulatory pressures on hmos  appear to be making medicare hmos a less attractive alternative 
while medicare supplement sales were down slightly  from million in to million  sales in the second half of increased over the first half of the year 
cancer insurance had the greatest percentage growth in in terms of annualized premium in force  gaining from million to million 
this compared with growth in annualized premium issued for this product line was million in each of the years through cancer business is written primarily by the liberty national agency  which had million  or of total cancer annualized premium in force at december  premium growth has been attained primarily through premium rate increases to offset increased healthcare costs 
annualized premium in force for other health products declined in to million  after declining in sales increased in  however  with annualized premium issued rising to million 
a large factor in the sales increase is increased issue of a limited benefit hospital surgical product sold by the united american independent agency 
health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium    policy obligations    required reserve inter est    net policy obligations    amortization of acquisi tion costs    commissions and premium taxes    required interest on de ferred acquisition costs    total expense    insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses 
   health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses declined in  despite increased premium  due to increased net policy obligations 
as a percentage of health insurance premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses declined approximately in after a slight increase in fluctuations in health insurance margins are common  resulting from inevitable short term timing differences due to the periodic nature of obtaining rate increase approvals from regulatory authorities and the pre existing health care cost inflation that justifies such rate increases 
to the extent that management is able to obtain timely and adequate rate increases  margin fluctuations will be minimized 
inflationary cost increases in the cancer business negatively impacted margins in  but significant rate increases implemented during the year should improve margins in similarly  medicare supplement underwriting margins have also experienced small declines 
the federal mandate of a minimum loss ratio on medicare supplement business and market competition make it difficult to improve underwriting margins on this product 
nonetheless  medicare supplement products are profitable to torchmark because of the low operating expenses associated with it 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term tax deferred growth opportunities 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds managed by w r  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to policyholders 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed     variable       total       premium collections on fixed annuities were million in  compared with million in and million in the decline in fixed collections resulted from a million decline in collections by the united american general agency that markets to bank customers 
these collections were million in  a record year 
also  in torchmark s collections on preneed annuities declined million 
the sale of preneed products was discontinued in late the fixed annuity balance rose in each of the periods presented  primarily because of the additional collections 
variable annuity collections were flat in when compared with at million  but grew in over collections of million 
the strength in financial market conditions in both and has had a positive influence on collections 
however  it is believed lower capital gains rates implemented by congress during may have been a negative factor in variable annuity sales 
torchmark s variable annuities are issued by uilic and are sold by w r sales representatives 
under a marketing agreement  torchmark will continue to market its variable annuities through the w r sales force subsequent to the planned spin off of w r 
see initial public offering and planned spin off of asset management segment on page of this report 
torchmark also plans to market variable annuities through its direct response distribution system in the variable account balance has climbed rapidly since  rising in to billion at december   and in to billion at year end a strong financial market in both and was the major factor in the rise in variable account values in those years 
variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities 
the additional collections in each year also added to the balances

annuity policy charges rose in to million  largely as a result of growth in the variable account balance 
policy charges grew in to million 
growth in policy charges results not only from the increase in size of the annuity account balances  but is also attributable to the increase in the number of annuity contracts in force and the cumulative effect of the growth in sales over the past few years on which the sales charge is based 
the investment spread is the investment income earned in excess of policy requirements on fixed annuity contracts 
as a percentage of the mean reserve  the interest spread has declined slightly in and because of the proportional decrease in size of the fixed account balance relative to the total account balance 
asset management torchmark s financial services operations include the marketing of mutual funds  including the united group and the w r group of funds through exclusive financial planners 
these representatives also market a variety of insurance products of torchmark subsidiaries 
asset management operations also involve the management of mutual fund portfolios  the management of institutional portfolios  and the servicing of customer accounts 
revenues are derived from commissions from the sale of investment and insurance products  fees for management of investment asset portfolios  and fees for servicing the accounts

financial services revenues rose to million in  compared with revenues of million 
these revenues grew in from revenues of million 
financial services revenues presented in torchmark s consolidated financial statements will not correspond to total revenues for the financial services segment presented above in the summary of results table because certain revenues as presented in the table are derived from other torchmark subsidiaries and are eliminated in consolidation 
asset management fees of million in were the largest component of financial services revenues  representing of segment revenues 
asset management fees were up in  after having risen to million in increases in these fees have occurred due to the growth in mutual fund assets and institutional assets under management  on which asset management fees are based 
average assets under management rose in and in average mutual fund assets under management grew in growth in average assets under management in and resulted from two factors 
first  strength in the financial markets caused increases in the values of fund securities 
secondly  new investment product sales and reinvested dividends in each period contributed to asset growth 
total assets under management were billion at december   an increase over the prior year end of 
total assets under management were billion at december  and billion at december  mutual fund assets under management rose in to billion at year end they rose in to billion at year end 
the composition of the portfolios managed has bearing on the relationship of asset management fees to assets under management 
equity oriented portfolios have higher fee rates than fixed income portfolios 
therefore  asset management fees grew at a higher rate than assets under management in primarily because of a change in the type of assets under management 
the total increase in assets under management for the period of 
billion was the result of a billion increase in mutual fund assets partially offset by a billion decrease in institutional assets 
the mutual fund assets that were added have a higher management fee rate than the institutional assets that were lost 
distribution revenues are derived from the sales of both investment and insurance products and accounted for of total asset management revenues 
investment product commissions represented of total distribution revenues in investment products consist of two different mutual fund groups  the w r funds and the united funds 
the united funds have a front load sales charge while the w r funds have a contingent deferred or back load charge 
the w r funds also charge a rule b distribution fee based on a percentage of assets under management 
the commissions from insurance products and variable annuities are primarily received from torchmark insurance subsidiaries  and are eliminated in consolidation 
w r and torchmark have agreed that w r will continue to market the variable annuities and insurance products of certain torchmark insurance companies subsequent to the announced spin off 
see initial public offering and planned spin off of asset management segment on page of this report 
investment product commissions rose to million in  after having increased to million in investment product collections increased in and were billion during both and investment product sales in climbed from billion 
in  sales of the united funds in terms of mutual fund collections were billion  rising from sales of billion 
these sales rose in the w r funds experienced a decline in sales of to million  but had a increase in sales volume 
insurance product commission revenues were level in each year through at million 
service fees are charged based on the number of accounts serviced 
they include fees for transfer agency  custody  and accounting 
service fees rose in to million  after having increased in to million 
the number of accounts serviced was million at december   an increase of 
accounts serviced were million at year end and million at year end pretax operating income for the asset management segment rose in to million 
pretax income increased in from million 
margins for this segment have exceeded in each of the periods considered 
margin improvements have resulted  in large part  from the increase in the proportion of asset management fees  which has a higher margin than other revenue sources 
commissions and selling expenses are the direct expenses associated with producing distribution revenue 
they consist of the commissions  bonuses  and other compensation paid to the sales force as well as other marketing and promotional costs 
these expenses correlate closely with distribution revenues 
other expenses  as a percentage of revenues  grew from in to in this increase was due primarily to a one time charge in in the amount of million which was largely related to the outsourcing of some data processing services and the discontinuance of internally developed systems 
had this charge not been incurred  expenses would have been of revenues  margins would have been  and pretax income would have been million 
investments torchmark s net investment income increased to million during the year  which follows an increase of in and an increase of in when adjusted for the acquisition of american income in late  however  the increase was 
as in the past several years  the increase in investment income primarily resulted from the continued accumulation of invested assets  which rose to billion at amortized cost by year end 
invested assets increased by in and in mean invested assets at amortized cost  adjusted for the disposition of torchmark s energy operations  were billion in  billion in  and billion in subsequent to the first quarter of  interest rates declined steadily throughout the remainder of the year 
investments during of billion were made at a tax equivalent yield of 
this compares with investments of billion in acquired at a tax equivalent yield of 
acquisitions during  which were increased by several sale programs  totaled billion 
the average life of acquisitions was years as compared with years in the previous year and years in torchmark varies its maturity selection based on a number of factors including the prevailing yield curve 
holdings of mortgage backed securities continue to decline as a percentage of the portfolio  due to repayments of mortgage backs and acquisitions of other types of fixed income investments 
the holdings of mortgage backed securities represented of the fixed income portfolio at year end  as compared with at year end and at year end torchmark considers its fixed income portfolio available for sale 
therefore  it is valued at market and is subject to fluctuations as interest rates change 
falling rates during propelled the value of the fixed income portfolio higher during the year 
at year end  the portfolio had an unrealized gain of million  compared with million at year end and million at year end during  the portfolio yield declined slightly to at year end  compared with at year end and at year end with the purchase of longer maturities in  the average life of the portfolio increased slightly to years at year end  compared with years at year end and years at year end the quality of torchmark s fixed income portfolio remains high 
the portfolio consists of securities of which were rated investment grade by standard poors and were rated investment grade by naic classification 
with the quality and liquidity of its fixed income investments  torchmark can minimize the level of its short term investments  which totaled million at year end and million at year end the following table presents investments by expected maturity 
short terms and under year years years years years over years fixed income investments continue to represent of invested assets  which causes the percentage holdings of the other types of investments to vary from the latest industry averages 
the following table presents torchmark s components of the investment portfolio compared with industry data 
torchmark amount industry in thousands investment grade and short term bonds  noninvestment grade bonds  preferred and common stocks  mortgage loans  real estate  policy loans  other invested assets  latest data available from the american council of life insurance 
torchmark profits to the extent that its net investment income exceeds the interest cost attributable to its net insurance policy liabilities and financing costs 
the following table presents torchmark s excess investment income  or tax equivalent net investment income in excess of its net policy reserve requirements and financing costs  as well as the related assets and liabilities 
analysis of excess investment income and related items dollar amounts in millions net investment income tax equivalency adjustment tax equivalent investment income required interest on net insurance policy liabil ities financing costs excess investment income average invested assets    increase over prior year dollars percentage average net interest bearing insurance policy li abilities    increase over prior year dollars percentage at amortized cost excess investment income increased in and in  as compared to increases in tax equivalent investment income of and  respectively 
the higher growth in excess investment income relative to tax equivalent investment income resulted from greater growth in average invested assets than in average net interest bearing insurance policy liabilities 
in addition  financing costs  which consist of interest on debt and dividends on the monthly income preferred securities  were of tax equivalent investment income in  down from in and in market risk sensitivity 
market risk is a risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk which is the risk that a change in a securities value could occur from a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed income holdings amount to of total investments 
the effects of these interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity from marking these investments to market as required by sfas the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is greatly reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets are offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities 
torchmark s insurance liabilities  in which interest assumptions are a factor in their computation  were billion at december   compared with fixed income investments of billion at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
the marking of these liabilities to market is not addressed by sfas market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives of maintaining a high quality fixed maturity portfolio 
no derivative instruments are used to manage its exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
a swap instrument was entered into to allow torchmark to participate in the downward trend in interest rates in connection with its monthly income preferred securities as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statement on page of this report and in capital resources of page of this report 
a cap instrument was also entered into to protect torchmark from the market risk on an increase in rates associated with the swap on this security 
volatility in the value of torchmark s fixed income holdings is reduced by maintaining a relatively short term portfolio  of which matures within ten years 
also  the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 
the liability for torchmark s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions  some of which are contractually guaranteed 
a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below amounts guaranteed 
torchmark s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations  the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company s obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
it has been determined from those procedures that torchmark s insurance policy liabilities  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets  are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio 
this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data is prepared through a model that measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments would have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
change in interest rates market value of in fixed maturity basis portfolio points in millions financial condition liquidity 
torchmark s liquidity relates to its ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is derived from three sources its positive cash flow from operations  its portfolio of short term investments  and its line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance and asset management operations generate positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations  including net cash provided from torchmark s deposit type insurance and annuity products  were million in  rising over million in operating cash flows for increased over cash flows of million 
in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million of investment maturities and repayments in  further enhancing total positive cash flow 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements

torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involve punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation has the potential for significant adverse results 
it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since the amount of punitive damages in alabama is left largely to the discretion of the jury in each case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation

to the degree possible  torchmark is verifying that these third party business systems are currently compliant or are in the process of becoming compliant 
to the extent these systems are not compliant  there is no assurance that the potential interruptions or cost to torchmark may not be significant
