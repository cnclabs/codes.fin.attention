item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus 
all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
net income and profitability net income and diluted earnings per share reached record highs in at million and  respectively 
compared to  net income rose while earnings per share were up 
the return on equity roe increased basis points to 
all per share results have been adjusted for the company s for stock split effective march  recurring or core earnings were up from last year to million after removing the impact of one time income and expense items including  in one time acquisition expense and net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and other assets 
s net income climbed over the prior year to million while earnings per share were up to  core earnings rose at a pace 
these results reflect the fourth consecutive year in which acquisitions had an important impact on the company s results 
nineteen ninety seven s earnings reflected the contributions of eight branches acquired in southwestern new york in mid june from keybank  na and twelve branches acquired in northern new york in mid july from fleet bank 
taken together  these branch locations of which three have been consolidated to date now account for approximately million in deposits or of our year end deposit base and million in loans or of our year end loan base 
s improvement in net income over the prior year is explained by the following major factors o net interest income full tax equivalent basis climbed or million due to significant increases in earning asset levels 
growth in loans and investments was million and million  respectively 
loans grew million or excluding acquired key and fleet loans 
this marks the fifth consecutive year in which loan growth has exceeded 
earning asset growth was funded by million in deposit growth resulting largely from the aforementioned acquisitions and was partially offset by reduced borrowings 
the increase in net interest income comes despite the net interest margin  at  averaging basis points lower than the level 
the margin decrease is due largely to the million in company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities issued to support the acquisitions 
the company s net interest margin declined by basis points on average to excluding favorable one time items 
o recurring noninterest income was up owing to the impact of continued strength in fiduciary and related services income  significant increases in bpa ebt revenue  higher fees from the sale of mutual funds  expanded revenues from merchant credit and check card processing  the imposition of atm surcharge fees  and greater overdraft fees  service charges  and commissions from an expanded customer base gained from the key and fleet branch purchase 
o overhead expense increased by  excluding one time costs of the key and fleet acquisitions  growth was million or 
the bulk of the latter increase reflects costs related to branch expansion  including more personnel both acquired branch staff and volume sensitive positions in operations and other areas needed to support the expanded balance sheet  greater data processing requirements  expanded facilities costs  increased amortization of intangible assets  and other associated expenses 
o for the year  one time acquisition related expense totaled  these expenses were more than offset by one time income totaling million as a result of accretion adjustments on called bonds  an unexpected gain on life insurance  a gain on million in loans sold in the secondary market in conjunction with a planned interest rate risk strategy  and a loan late fee recording adjustment 
with the exception of two potential branch consolidations in  the last major installment of key and fleet related acquisition expenses was absorbed during fourth quarter o loan loss provision expense rose reflecting higher net charge offs and the company s practice to cover them by  charge offs related to acquired key and fleet loans were absorbed by the one time valuation allowance established at acquisition date for that purpose 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding rose to 
versus 
in  largely due to consumer installment loans  which accounted for more than of s increase in net charge offs  over of consumer charge offs was due to indirect automobile loans 
nonperforming loans increased to million  a level million or higher than one year ago  about of the increase pertains to consumer installment loans with the balance largely in commercial loans 
as a result of tighter loan underwriting standards  changes in personnel  and strengthened monitoring and control  management anticipates improvement in the charge off trend during o the company s effective tax rate was significantly reduced in because of greater tax exempt income 
the above combination of factors resulted in a level of profitability which may be compared to that of cbsi s peer bank holding companies  this group is comprised of companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets based on data through september  as provided by the federal reserve system 
through year to date september  net income per dollar employed  or return on average assets  was in  compared to the peer norm of 
shareholder return on equity  or net income as a percent of average equity  was for the same period versus the median for peers of 
underlying these improved levels of profitability on an annual basis is a steady increase in quarterly performance measures for the four quarters of the two acquisitions were immediately accretive to earnings in the third quarter when earnings per share reached a record high of 
fourth quarter earnings per share were off 
from that pace to 
largely due to increases in loan loss provision and selected overhead costs 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per common share percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets cash adjusted earnings and profitability consistent earnings growth has been achieved despite the increasing noncash expense of amortizing deposit intangibles created by branch acquisitions 
many analysts consider that a better measure of the economic value of an acquisition is the cash earnings it generates  which is determined by adding back to reported earnings the after tax expense of amortizing the acquisition premium 
on that basis  cbsi s cash earnings increased in to million  reflecting the half year impact of the summer s acquisitions  and climbed in to million  representing the full year impact of the mid chase branch purchases 
nineteen ninety five s cash earnings were million 
return on assets is also significantly higher on a cash basis  being   and in   and  respectively 
in contrast to s increase in reported earnings per share eps to  cash basis eps rose to 
last year s reported eps rose compared to on a cash basis of 
as opposed to the 
decline in s reported results  cash eps rose 
to 
fourth quarter cash eps is 
higher than reported eps on an annualized basis 
performance measured by tangible or cash return on equity also showed better improvement than reported results  reaching in  almost regaining the pre level prior to the million capital issuance which financed the chase branch purchase 
tangible return on equity was in and in net interest income net interest income is the company s principal source of core operating income for payment of overhead and possible loan losses 
it is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors as well as interest on borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
net interest income with nontaxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase from the prior year 
the increase was entirely due to higher earning asset volumes  which had a positive impact on net interest income of million  while interest rate changes had a negative impact of million 
in contrast  interest rate changes in had a negative impact of only  versus higher earning asset volumes having a positive impact of million 
combining these components  s net interest income rose million or over the prior year to million 
with regard to the interest income component of s net interest income  greater average earning assets of million contributed all but of the million more in gross interest income up 
nearly or million in s average earning asset growth resulted from increased lending activity in existing markets and the impact of loans initially acquired at the key and fleet branches 
the average ratio of loans to earning assets increased percentage points this year to as a consequence of the aforementioned loan growth 
higher loan volume accounted for million of the increase in gross interest income  higher average loan yields  which rose basis points to this year  added  to interest income 
through september   the company s loan yield was in the favorable th peer bank percentile 
the remaining million of earning asset growth is explained by an increase in investment outstandings  this reflects both the strategic use of leveraging when favorable buying opportunities existed and the impact of investments purchased from funds provided by s branch acquisitions 
higher investment volumes including money market instruments contributed million of the increase in gross interest income  while higher investment yields up basis point to added only  in through september   the company s investment yield excluding money market instruments was in the very favorable nd peer bank percentile 
the total of average deposits and borrowings grew by million in  primarily attributable to acquired deposits 
of the resulting million increase in total interest expense  over of this additional expense was due to interest paid on time deposits 
during  time deposit rates averaged  or basis points higher than in the mix of time deposits to average liabilities also increased slightly  reflecting the acquired deposits having a relatively higher proportion of time deposits 
cbsi s million in trust preferred securities also caused interest expense to rise  contributing to the basis point increase in the average borrowing rate 
the cost of the bank s interest bearing account base not priced relative to the treasury yield curve remained stable 
the average rate on savings including interest checking and money market accounts increased by only two basis points during  rising from in to this year 
the ratio of interest bearing funds to average earning assets rose slightly in to 
overall  higher interest bearing outstandings contributed million more in interest expense while higher rates added million 
through september   the company s average cost of funds rate rose to the less favorable th peer bank percentile  as compared to being in the rd percentile through september  in summary  cbsi s net interest margin declined by basis points in  from in to this year o the average earning asset yield increased basis points to because of the aforementioned increase in average loan yield and an increased mix of loans to earning assets  as most types of loans have historically had higher yields than marketable securities 
o the increase in the average earning asset yield compares to an unfavorable basis point increase in the average cost of funds total interest expense divided by average earning assets to in this was due to the aforementioned increased time deposit rate and mix  and the growing proportion of longer term borrowings including the trust preferred securities 
despite the decline in the company s net interest margin  it ranks in the peer normal st percentile through september  while the company s net interest margin has historically been well above the norm  the primary objective in recent years has been to maximize shareholder returns through active utilization of tangible capital 
thus  as management focuses on growing the earning asset base of the company  there has been a downward change in margin resulting from leverage strategies to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities  this margin decrease is considered secondary to increasing the future stream of net interest income

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are recurring fees from core banking operations including personal trust income and revenues from one time events  defined as net gains losses from the sale of investments  loans  and miscellaneous assets 
additional recurring income results from investment management  recordkeeping  and consulting services provided by benefit plans administrative services  inc bpa and the bank s employee benefit trust function ebt 
total noninterest income increased to million from to a quarter of the increase was attributable to the acquired branches  and another quarter attributable to the full year impact of bpa 
core banking fees excluding bpa ebt and nonrecurring income were up strongly for the third consecutive year to approximately million in  a improvement following a increase in included in this year s growth is approximately  more in fees due to the impact of the former key and fleet branches 
recurring noninterest income as a percent of total operating income net interest income plus recurring noninterest income reached in  up meaningfully from and in and  respectively 
while progress has been steady  this ratio remains below the norm of or the st peer percentile 
in light of management s objective to grow noninterest income toward the peer median  opportunities to develop new fee based products are actively pursued  and the collection of fees for providing quality service is emphasized 
in  these efforts resulted in the institution of an atm transaction surcharge for nonbank customers and the launching of cash management products for commercial businesses 
the focus on growth has also continued to drive efforts to increase fiduciary income  control waived fees  and competitively price deposit service charges and commission based services 
as a result of these efforts  in addition to the benefits provided by the key and fleet acquisitions and a full year of bpa operations  fees from core banking operations improved in several key areas in o fees from personal trust services expanded to almost million  up in versus in  primarily reflecting a greater level of annual administrative fees on trust and individual investment management accounts  offset by a decline in estate fees 
continued focus on business development  including expanded referral programs  is expected to strengthen future fiduciary income growth 
total assets under management by cbna s trust department excluding bpa ebt related assets were million as of year end  up from million and million at year end and  respectively 
o service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees increased to million in  a growth rate versus in the increase reflects the impact of fees and commissions from an expanded customer base gained from the key and fleet acquisitions and an emphasis on ensuring competitive pricing and reducing waived fees 
note that s increase reflected the full year impact of s chase branch acquisition 
o fees earned through the company s visa affiliation rose in to  attributable mainly to continued growth of the visa check card product which more than doubled from to  with visa merchant discount fees remaining essentially flat 
the direct margin on merchant discount fees net of processing expense dropped percentage points to in o is the fourth year in which cbsi has offered annuities  mutual funds  and other investment products through financial services representatives fsr s located in nine selected geographic markets within the bank s branch network 
these individuals are registered representatives working through primevest financial services  inc of saint cloud  minnesota 
commission income from this activity in reached million on asset sales of million  up over from  in on sales of million 
a greater emphasis continues to be placed on growing this line of special investment products as evidenced by two additions to sales staff during the last half of and the hiring of a full time program administrator in early general commissions and miscellaneous income at million were up more than in this increase is attributable to  more in dividends from the new york state bankers association s insurance subsidiary  an increased level of canadian exchange revenue  and the impact of miscellaneous fees generated by the key and fleet branches 
nineteen ninety seven s nonrecurring other income was  this includes a  gain on life insurance and gains on the sale of student loans and mortgages sold in the secondary market 
revenue from record keeping and consulting services provided by bpa acquired in july and investment management services provided by the pre existing ebt department totaled million in compared to million in  a increase as a result of the full year impact of bpa operations and strong business development efforts 
total assets under management by bpa ebt more than doubled in to million as of year end  up from million and million in and  respectively

the key and fleet acquisitions caused personnel additions both acquired branch staff and volume sensitive positions in operations and other areas needed to support the expanded balance sheet  greater data processing requirements  expanded facilities costs  and other expenses associated with servicing the expanded customer base 
overhead growth also reflects the impact of a full year of operating benefit plans administrators acquired in july total one time key and fleet related acquisition expenses were approximately  in  including a loss of  on sale of a duplicate branch facility accounted for as an offset to nonrecurring income 
as a percent of average assets  overhead increased from in to in  representing the peer normal th percentile 
for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for over of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs being up versus being higher in greater salary  benefit  and payroll tax expense primarily reflect staffing in the new branches  along with modest annual merit awards for existing personnel

higher occupancy expense  depreciation on equipment  office supplies  telephone  courier and armored car expense  postage  business development  and computer services resulted from the impact of the new branches added in mid total amortization of intangibles increased by  or to million in as a result of the branch acquisitions 
various other increases related to inflation  internal volume growth  the full year impact of bpa  expenses associated with repossessed assets  a change in reporting commission expense associated with annuity mutual fund sales  and the valuation of cbsi director phantom stock were partially offset by lower fdic insurance expense which resulted from the absence of a special one time assessment in to rebuild the savings association insurance fund saif 
the efficiency ratio is defined as overhead expense divided by recurring operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses  the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
in  the efficiency ratio increased by percentage points to  which exceeds the national peer bank median of based on data available as of september  the increase reflects the impact of one time key and fleet acquisition related expenses incurred in combined with a disproportionately smaller increase in operating income  since most of the acquired deposits funded investments rather than higher yielding loans 
however  this year s ratio is essentially equal to the level of  which was impacted by similar circumstances caused by the chase branch acquisition 
excluding all nonrecurring income  one time expenses  and the company s relatively high level of intangible amortization  the efficiency ratio is based on full year results 
this calculation can be more logically compared to the median for peer banks  which generally experience a much lower level of intangible amortization and which as a group are not heavily impacted by one time acquisition expenses 
nonetheless the company is striving to reduce its efficiency ratio by capturing opportunities for greater economies of scale at its enlarged size  including steady deployment of productivity enhancing technology 
management has set an objective to bring this ratio inclusive of intangible amortization downward to within the next three years 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  management maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminating inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer comparisons  a bank wide program of employee involvement in cost containment  and targeted use of outside consultants 
these combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from price increases and higher transaction volumes and enable the company to more fully benefit from economies of scale as it continues to grow

when pre tax income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxable on a federal basis  s results rose by  or 
largely as a result of the acquisitions  pre tax earnings were favorably impacted by million greater net interest income full tax equivalent basis and a million climb in noninterest income 
these factors were partially offset by million more in overhead expense also related to the acquisitions  and million more in loan loss provision expense associated with an increased level of consumer loan charge offs and the need to maintain adequate reserves in light of cbsi s strong loan growth 
the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate dropped a significant basis points this year to 
the rate decreased because of an increasing proportion of tax exempt investment income  a nonrecurring  nontaxable gain on life insurance  and the lack of s additional taxes and interest resulting from an irs tax audit of the years to capital shareholders equity ended at million  up over from one year earlier  primarily reflective of the contribution of strong earnings less dividends paid to shareholders

the proceeds from the issuance were used to fund the key and fleet branch acquisitions  and to redeem the million remaining half of cbsi s preferred stock issued in mid the ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  remains sound at 
this level compares to a year ago 
despite higher capital produced by this year s strong earnings and the aforementioned community capital trust i  the decrease in the tier i ratio was a result of increased intangibles attributed to the key and fleet branch acquisitions 
the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of as of year end was well above the minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the company is confident that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives

outstandings climbed over million or in comparative growth rates were for and in this year s growth resulted from strong business development efforts  the aforementioned contribution of acquired branches  and the addition of a number of experienced commercial lenders over the last few years 
more than of the bank s total number of commercial loans have balances less than  which as a group constitutes approximately of commercial loan outstandings

demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine  and mobile home dealers continued to be very active in for the fourth consecutive year 
outstandings ended nearly or million higher compared to growth of or million in the prior year 
strength was evidenced in both cbsi s northern region  where this type of lending has been highly successful for a number of years  and in the southern region  where the commitment to indirect lending was re energized during and has continued with success since then 
this portfolio segment  of which relates to automobile lending used vehicles versus new  constitutes of total loans outstanding  up from its low of at year end no indirect loans were part of the mid summer acquisitions 
the segment of the company s loan portfolio committed to consumer mortgages includes both fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
it accounts for million or of total loans outstanding 
the growth during the last two years million or in  and million or in is lower than it would otherwise be due to a program which began in mid to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
the purpose of this program  which resulted in sales of million in its first year  million in  million in and million this year  is to develop a meaningful source of servicing income as well as to provide an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
the direct consumer lending activity has increased modestly over the last five years 
outstandings rose or million versus or million in largely due to loans obtained with the summer acquisitions 
this line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans including some isolated installment lending to small businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principle amortization begins  and borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit

with the exception of installment loans  these measures compare favorably to delinquencies of peer bank holding companies as of september  of   and  respectively 
management views the higher installment loan delinquencies to be temporary and anticipates that the ratio will improve in with tighter loan underwriting standards  changes in personnel  and strengthened monitoring and control 
the bank strives to maintain its total and component category delinquencies below a internal guideline  and is comfortable that this objective continues to be realistic 
as of september   when overall delinquencies were at  the company ranked in the th peer percentile 
factors contributing to successful underwriting  collection  and credit monitoring include selective addition of experienced lenders over the last several years  loan servicing on a regionally based level  collection departments focused on taking prompt corrective action  and a centralized loan review function which is given priority attention and has regular board of director accountability 
another measure of the company s good asset quality is a reasonable net charge offs record  which finished the year at million or 
of average loans 
as a result of higher installment loan charge offs  gross charge offs rose to million  or 
of average loans outstanding versus 
in this year s recoveries rose to an all time record in dollar amount of  while down from in percentage terms to of prior year gross charge offs 
as of september   the bank s net charge off ratio was in the th peer percentile 
it should be noted  as with the higher installment delinquencies  management views the growth in installment loan charge offs to be temporary 
a timely charge off policy and relatively low nonperforming loans have enabled the company to carry a reserve for loan losses below peers 
as a percent of total loans  the loss reserve ratio has increased to a level for the year ended though the reserve ratio is presently in the th peer percentile  coverage over nonperforming loans as of september  was well above the norm in the th percentile  management believes the year end level at to be ample 
the company s small business loan orientation has historically reduced the likelihood of large  single borrower charge offs 
another measure of comfort to management is that after conservative allocation by specific customer and loan type  over of loan loss reserves remains available for absorbing general  unforeseen loan losses 
the annual loan loss provision has characteristically been well in excess of net charge offs  which have had coverage of over times since this practice has enabled a steady increase in the loan loss reserve level  which rose by million or to an all time high of million at year end includes a million valuation allowance to absorb acquired key and fleet loan charge offs 
as a percentage of average loans  the annual loan loss provision was well above the peer norm in the th percentile as of september  for full year  the loss provision ratio was  having remained in a 
to 
range during the prior three year period 
this upward movement reflects the need to cover s higher net charge offs by excluding those pertaining to acquired key and fleet loans so as to keep pace with record loan growth and maintain the loss reserve ratio at an adequate level

there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital market borrowings 
sources of funds average fourth quarter balances millions total funds year ipc deposits public funds capital borrowings sources amount total amount total amount total amount the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time high for a fourth quarter average of  million  up million or from the comparable period 
ipc deposits are generally considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because of their general stability and relatively low cost  and because they represent a working customer base with the potential to be cross sold a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products 
strongly impacting the company s ipc funding source were the key and fleet branch acquisitions which took place in june and july of this year 
these branches account for approximately million or over of the fourth quarter growth in ipc deposits 
following initial deposit attrition of a modest through year end  steady acclimation of this new customer base within the company will help reduce further erosion of this funding source during the mix of cbsi s ipc deposits has changed over the last four years 
the steady growth in time deposit share  from of deposits in to this year  reflects consumer movement away from immediately available  lower earning savings and money market accounts 
deposits of local municipalities increased million or during the past year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter in the key and fleet branch acquisitions contributed and million  respectively  towards the increase 
excluding the key and fleet branches  the bank experienced a million or decrease in municipal deposits 
under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
utilization of municipal deposits has gradually been decreasing over the last four years as a percent of total funding sources 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
also considered borrowing though it serves as tier i capital is the million in company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities issued to support s acquisitions 
capital market borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter compared to million or of total funding sources for the same period in the lower level of borrowings in is largely due to the net proceeds from the key and fleet transaction being utilized to repay borrowings 
as of december   nearly half or million of capital market borrowings excluding the aforementioned trust preferred securities had original terms of one year or more

this must be accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand is low and infusing funds when demand is high  b implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investment risk weights as determined by regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and e generating a favorable return without undue compromise of other requirements 
when choosing an appropriate investment for balance sheet management  the applied analytical method favored by the company is total return 
while the type of strategy considered ultimately determines the scope of analysis performed  management commonly tests the performance of its investment purchases over a one and three year forward time horizon  under conditions which include interest rate movements of up or down basis points from current levels 
it is through this methodology that prepayment risk  embedded option risk  and market value risk can be properly quantified by the company 
throughout  the balance sheet of the company exhibited a structurally asset sensitive profile  in large part due to the influence of the key and fleet branch deposit acquisitions consummated in mid summer of this year 
as a result  investment strategies pursued were primarily designed to manage this asset sensitive interest rate risk exposure  with a focus on improving the relative performance of net interest income in both rising and falling interest rate environments 
among the strategies employed by the company during were the purchase of fixed rate u 
s callable agency debentures with three to five years of initial call protection  as well as premium us agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
in addition  a number of longer dated insured municipal bonds were added to the portfolio because of their favorable risk reward profile when compared to other investment alternatives 
total portfolio growth slowed to during the past year as many of the company s capital resources were redirected towards funding growth in the loan portfolio 
as such  much of the portfolio activity was the result of a reinvestment of funds from mortgage backed security prepayments and callable bond proceeds 
total portfolio outstandings as of december  were million as compared to million as of year end the composition of the portfolio continues to favor us governments and us agency mortgage backed obligations  achieving effective use of regulatory risk based capital 
at december   these two security types excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock accounted for of total portfolio investments versus in the prior year 
the average life of the portfolio  including the exercise of embedded call options  increased slightly to years as of year end 
the increase reflects million in agency bonds called this year  which resulted in  of bond discount accretion being taken into income   was earned in on a million called bond

market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the company 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits  and the overall level and trend of market interest rates 
interest rate risk at community bank  na  the fundamental purpose behind interest rate risk management is to maximize net interest income over both a short term tactical and longer term strategic time horizon 
because the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify its sources of interest rate risk 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation 
the analysis begins by measuring the impact of differences in maturity and repricing of all balance sheet positions 
such work is further augmented by adjusting for prepayment and embedded option risk found naturally in certain asset and liability classes 
finally  balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the company 
changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance sheet to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities including the traditional regulatory requirement of an immediate up or down shock of basis points from current levels 
while such an aggressive movement in rates provides management with good insight as to how its profit margins may perform under extreme market conditions  results from a more modest shift in interest rates are used as a basis to conduct day to day business decisions 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity analysis as of december  assuming a step up or down in rates over a twelve month period one of the simulation tests used for day to day decision making 
in addition  this test assumes a static  no growth balance sheet rate change estimated basis points net interest income sensitivity the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps and floors of adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the relationship within days between liquid assets and short term liabilities which are vulnerable to nonreplacement  and second  a projection of subsequent cash flow funding needs over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons 
as of year end  this ratio was and  respectively
