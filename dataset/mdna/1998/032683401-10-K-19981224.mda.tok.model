in july  the company expanded its services to state and local governments by acquiring substantially all of the assets of westinghouse landmark gis  inc asi landmark for million in cash 
based in north carolina  asi landmark s primary business is land base and cadastral mapping

asi landmark also provided the company with additional capacity for photogrammetry  and a presence in the eastern and southeastern united states 
the acquisition contributed approximately new customers  million in backlog and employees to the company 
the company acquired mse corporation mse in july for million in cash and  shares of restricted common stock valued at million 
the acquisition of indiana based mse gave the company greater capacity to serve the utility market and further enhanced asi s presence in the midwestern united states 
in addition  the acquisition of mse contributed over customers and million of backlog to the company 
over employees joined the asi workforce as a result of the mse acquisition  including the company s current chief operations officer and chief administrative officer

as of september   goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
the company will amortize the value of the intangible assets acquired in its recent business acquisitions over a period of years  representing the expected period of benefit from the acquisitions 
the company believes this amortization period to be appropriate based on the historical and forecasted operating results of the acquired businesses 
the company recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a cost to cost basis 
for each contract  an estimate of total production costs is determined 
at each accounting period and for each of the company s contracts  the percentage of completion is based on production costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated production costs 
this percentage is then multiplied by the contract s total value to calculate the sales revenue to be recognized 
production costs consist of internal costs  primarily salaries and wages  and external costs  primarily subcontractor costs 
internal and external production costs may vary considerably among projects and during the course of completion of each project 
as a result  the company experiences yearly and quarterly fluctuations in production costs  in salaries  wages and related benefits and in subcontractor costs 
these costs may vary as a percentage of sales from period to period 
since the company has relied less on subcontractors and more on employees 
the company anticipates that  as a percentage of sales  salaries  wages and related benefits will continue to increase  with a corresponding decrease in subcontractor costs  due  in part  to the company s may purchase of interra technologies  an india based company that had been a provider of subcontractor services to the company

sales and marketing expenses associated with obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred 
backlog increases when new contracts are signed and decreases as revenue is recognized 
as of september   backlog was million 
recently  the number of large projects awarded to the company has increased 
contracts for larger projects generally increase the company s risk due to inflation as well as changes in customer expectations and funding availability 
the company s contracts are generally terminable on short notice  and while in the company s experience such termination is rare  there is no assurance that the company will receive all of the revenue anticipated under signed contracts 
see item business risk factors risks associated with terms of customer contracts and customer contracts 
the company engages in research and development activities 
the majority of these activities occur as the company develops software or designs a product for a particular contract  so that the costs of such efforts are included as an integral part of the company s services 
such custom designed software can often be applied to projects for other customers 
these amounts expended by the company are not included in research and development expenses  although the company retains ownership of such proprietary software or products 
the company  through its advanced technology division  also engages in research and development activities independently of the company s work on particular customer projects

year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
the failure of such programs to recognize the year as such could result in systems failures and miscalculations 
the company and the third parties with which it does business rely on numerous computer programs in their daily operations 
the company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of the year issues 
the company expects that such assessment and any required action will be carried out solely by its employees 
accordingly  the company has not incurred material costs to date and does not believe that the costs associated with this process will be material 
the company has assessed its most critical systems  its proprietary operations software  and believes such software to be year compliant 
the company is in the process of assessing its other internal systems  including financial and other operational systems for year compliance  including information technology it and critical non it areas where year issues may exist 
the majority of the personal computers used by the company are running microsoft s windows or windows or microsoft nt operating systems  each of which the company believes will be substantially year compliant before the company expects that any personal computers that are not year compliant will be upgraded or replaced prior to although the company has not completed its assessment of internal systems readiness for year  the company believes that the costs required to remedy internal year issues will not be material 
the company has not formally surveyed its relationships with its vendors or subcontractors 
based on informal inquiries  the company does not believe that any of its significant vendors or subcontractors is or is likely to present any significant exposure due to the year issues 
if any such vendors or subcontractors or their products are not year compliant and they suffer significant business interruptions or use of their products interfere with the company s operations  the company believes that alternative vendors and subcontractors will be available to provide the services and products provided by the company s current vendors and subcontractors at comparable costs 
the company s customer contracts specify database designs  including date fields  and the company s delivery of data conforms to such specifications 
accordingly  the company has not formally evaluated the year issue as it relates to the computer systems used by its customers and potential customers 
the company faces risk to the extent its major customers do not comply with year requirements in their own operations and suffer business disruptions as a result 
to the extent year issues cause significant delays or cancellation of customer s gis projects  the company s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
based on currently available information  the company believes that it does not have material exposure to significant business interruption as a result of year compliance issues 
however  the company is planning to undertake a more formal review of its internal operational systems and its significant vendors and subcontractors  which it expects to complete by march  however  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the systems used by the company in its internal operations
