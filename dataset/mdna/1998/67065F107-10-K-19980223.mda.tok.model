year compliance the year issue refers to problems that may result from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the operating partnership and its subsidiaries are in the process of assessing the impact of the year issue on their operations to ensure that necessary technology changes are identified  tested and implemented 
the subsidiaries rely heavily upon data processing services provided by third party service providers  including securities custody  transfer agency  trading and pricing services and on a daily basis  trade through security exchanges which are highly automated 
the subsidiaries also have internally developed software programs and use third party software programs 
action plans being developed by the subsidiaries include purchasing or developing new software systems which are year compatible  obtaining certifications attesting to year systems compliance from third party vendors  and testing of systems 
progress on year initiatives is being monitored by the operating partnership s audit committee and the audit committees of each subsidiary 
management believes the cost of implementing these action plans will not materially adversely affect the operating results or financial condition of the partnership or the operating partnership
