while crossmann s management is committed to growing the company in a controlled and profitable manner  there are many factors outside the company s control 
the company s business and the homebuilding industry in general are subject to changes in economic conditions  including but not limited to employment levels  interest rates  the availability of credit  and consumer confidence 
the company s success over the past several years has been influenced by a variety of factors including favorable economic conditions in its principal markets  the availability of capital for expansion  and low interest rates 
to the extent these conditions do not continue  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
the growth in the company s sales is principally attributable to increased unit sales  as price increases have been moderate 
future increases in sales and profitability will be largely dependent upon the ability of management to expand the company s operations in its current markets or in any new markets and continued control of operating costs 
there can be no assurance that these trends will continue  nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to successfully transfer its business strategy to new market areas  that new markets will offer the opportunities and stability of the company s existing markets  that government sponsored mortgage programs will not be changed or withdrawn  or that interest rates will not change substantially

   liquidity and capital resources at december   crossmann had cash balances of million 
the company s primary uses of capital are home construction costs and the purchase and development of land 
real estate inventories were approximately million or of total assets at december  compared to approximately million or of total assets at december  to assure the future availability of developed lots for next year s operations  from time to time in the normal course of business the company contracts to purchase a portion of its developed lots from outside developers 
total commitments for these purchases was approximately million at december  the purchases of these lots are subject to various conditions imposed on both the sellers and the company 
capital is also used to add and improve equipment used in administering the business and for model home furnishings 
during  cash expenditures were financed with cash from operations and with borrowings on a million unsecured line of credit with bank one  indiana na and its participant  nbd bank na the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  but permits portions of the outstanding balance to be committed for fixed periods of time at a rate equal to libor plus 
the company also has  in senior notes  payable over seven years at an interest rate of  held by the minnesota mutual life insurance company and combined insurance company of america 
both the note agreements and the bank line of credit require compliance with certain financial and operating covenants and place certain limitations on the company s investments in land and unconsolidated joint ventures 
they also limit payments of cash dividends by the company 
the notes and the modifications to the banks credit agreement are expected to provide adequate liquidity for planned internal growth and capital expenditures 
in the event that the company seeks to accelerate growth through the acquisition of large parcels of land or of other homebuilders  additional capital may be necessary 
the company believes that such capital could be obtained from banks or other financing alternatives  from the issuance of additional shares  or from seller financing  however  there can be no assurances that the company would be able to secure the necessary capital 
inflation and effects of changing prices the company historically has been able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases and accordingly has not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
housing demand  in general  is affected adversely by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  the company s sales of residential real estate could be adversely affected 
in addition  gross profit and net income can be affected as well because crossmann can assist buyers  subject to certain limitations by fha and va  by paying a portion of a customer s points and closing costs needed to help in securing a mortgage loan 
year system requirements crossmann is performing an analysis if its systems and is working with suppliers and service organizations to determine the impact of year issues 
management is unable to predict at this time the full impact year issues will have on its operations or future financial condition  but based on preliminary evaluation  believes the cost of needed changes will not be material 
future trends management believes the company s profitability results in part from high volume production in its markets 
in  management will focus on building the kind of strong relationships with vendors and land sellers in its new markets that it enjoys in its more established markets in central indiana 
management views land acquisition and zoning as the greatest challenges to its business in years to come 
the company will continue to seek to maximize the value of each parcel it purchases so that it can continue to serve its core customer
