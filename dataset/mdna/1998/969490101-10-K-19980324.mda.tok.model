item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the company s historical consolidated financial position at december   and  and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
overview the company commenced operations in may  following the consolidation and completion of the company s initial public offering 
since  the company and its predecessors have concentrated their drilling activities in the trend 
oil and gas production in the trend is generally characterized by a high initial production rate  followed by a steep rate of decline 
in order to maintain its oil and gas reserve base  production levels and cash flow from operations  the company has been required to maintain or increase its level of drilling activity and achieve comparable or improved results from such activities 
beginning in  the company initiated several exploratory projects designed to reduce its dependence on trend drilling for future production and reserve growth 
these new areas include other formations in the vicinity of its core properties in east central texas  as well as south texas  louisiana and mississippi 
during  the company plans to devote a substantial portion of its capital expenditures to these new areas and also intends to actively seek and evaluate opportunities to acquire proven properties 
see liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties  whereby costs of productive wells  developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized and amortized using the unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
costs of unproved properties are initially capitalized 
those properties with significant acquisition costs are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to expense 
the amount of impairment recognized on unproved properties which are not individually significant is determined by amortizing the costs of such properties within appropriate groups based on the company s historical experience  acquisition dates and average lease terms 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs  including the cost of stratigraphic test wells  are initially capitalized but charged to expense if and when the well is determined to be unsuccessful

includes effects of hedging transactions 
compared to revenues oil and gas sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in oil production 
the effect of higher oil production was partially offset by a decrease in oil prices and a decline in gas production 
production from wells completed subsequent to december  accounted for approximately of total oil production for the period  which more than offset the effects of steep production declines from previously existing trend wells 
the company plans to discontinue trend drilling in april pending an improvement in oil prices  which have fallen to their lowest levels in four years 
the suspension of trend drilling activities for an extended period of time may adversely affect the company s production and revenues in costs and expenses lease operations expenses increased from million in to million in while oil and gas production on a boe basis increased  resulting in a decrease in lease operations expenses on a boe basis from per boe in to per boe in higher initial rates of production on several of the wells completed during contributed materially to the decline in lease operations expenses per boe 
exploration costs increased from million in to million in due primarily to costs incurred during in connection with exploration projects initiated during the fourth quarter of the company plans to spend approximately million in on exploratory prospects 
because the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in oil and gas production on a boe basis  combined with an increase in the company s average depletion rate per boe 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per boe was in the period compared to in the period 
general and administrative g a expenses increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased personnel costs 
in response to an increase in demand for skilled technical and mangerial personnel in the oil and gas industry and an increase in the company s level of exploration and development activities  the company has hired additional personnel and increased salaries of existing personnel 
interest expense interest expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower average levels of indebtedness on the company s secured credit facility the credit facility and  to a much lesser extent  lower average interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding on such facility during the period was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees  during the period was compared to in compared to revenues oil and gas sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in oil production  a increase in oil prices net of hedging losses  and a increase in gas prices 
these benefits were offset in part by an decline in gas production since most of the wells drilled since have been predominately oil wells 
production from wells completed subsequent to december  accounted for approximately of total oil production for the period  which more than offset the effects of steep production declines from previously existing trend wells 
revenues from natural gas services decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the sale of the company s two principal gas gathering and processing systems in august  and offset in part by additional revenues generated in related to a gas plant and three gathering systems acquired in the first quarter of costs and expenses lease operations expenses increased from million in to million in while production on a boe basis increased  resulting in an increase in lease operations expenses on a boe basis from per boe in to per boe in such increase was due primarily to higher production taxes resulting from the increase in oil and gas sales prices in as compared to although exploration costs were relatively insignificant in and  the company expects exploration costs to increase significantly during due to the initiation of the cotton valley exploratory project and other exploration activities outside the trend 
to date  the company has committed to spend approximately million to conduct and evaluate a d seismic survey covering approximately  acres in the north giddings block in the company may continue to expand the area covered by the survey and may drill one or more exploratory wells on any prospects which result from such survey 
in addition  the company plans to spend approximately million on other exploration activities  a significant portion of which will be classified as exploration costs 
because the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which such costs are incurred and expensed 
dd a expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a decline in the company s average depletion rate per boe  offset in part by a increase in production on a boe basis 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the lower depletion rate is attributable to a combination of higher proved reserves resulting from both newly completed wells and higher product prices  and lower depletable costs resulting from the impairment of certain producing properties in october and june pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets sfas 
as a result  the average depletion rate declined from per boe in to per boe in the company recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during the second quarter of in accordance with sfas  as compared to a million provision made during the fourth quarter of upon the adoption of sfas g a expenses decreased from million in to million in certain cost reduction measures implemented beginning in march were fully realized during accordingly  the company does not expect g a expenses to continue to decrease as they have in recent years 
costs of natural gas services decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the sale of the company s two principal gas gathering and processing systems in august  and offset in part by additional costs incurred in related to a gas plant and three gathering systems acquired during the first quarter of interest expense and other interest expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower average levels of indebtedness on the credit facility and  to a lesser extent  lower average interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding on such facility in was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt in was compared to in proceeds from the sales of assets in august and january and the sale of common stock through a shareholder rights offering in september  which aggregated approximately million  were used to reduce bank indebtedness and contributed largely to the reduction in interest expense in as compared to in addition  the company used million of proceeds from the sale of common stock to further reduce bank debt in november as a result  the company anticipates interest expense in to be lower than other income decreased from million in to  in in august  xcel gas company  a general partnership in which the company owned a interest  sold its interest in a gas gathering system  and the company sold its interest in the el campo gas processing system  for aggregate net proceeds of million  resulting in a combined gain on sale of property and equipment of million  net to the company 
compared to revenues oil and gas sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher oil prices  the benefit of which was largely eliminated by the effects of lower gas prices and a decline in oil and gas production 
although production from wells completed after december  accounted for of the company s production  these additions were more than offset by characteristically steep production declines from previously existing trend wells 
average prices received for oil production increased while average gas prices declined 
revenues from natural gas services decreased from million in to million in  despite the sale in august of the company s two principal gas gathering and processing systems  since one of the systems sold was acquired effective january and did not contribute to revenues in costs and expenses lease operations expenses increased from million in to million in despite a decline in boe production 
on a boe basis  lease operations expenses increased from per boe to per boe 
operating expenses of trend wells are generally lower on a boe basis in the early stages of production since a large portion of the operating expenses are fixed in nature and do not vary with production volume 
as production volumes decline  operating expenses per boe typically increase 
in addition  during  the company conducted most of its drilling activity in the updip area of the trend where the reservoir pressures are lower 
generally  this requires wells to be converted from flowing wells to electric powered pumping units at an earlier stage of production  which increases the lifting costs associated with the updip wells 
effective october   the company adopted sfas  and recorded a million non cash provision for impairment of certain producing assets 
substantially all of the impaired assets are located in the pearsall field in the trend 
dd a expense remained constant from to  despite a decline in production  due to slightly higher amortization rates per boe 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the effects on amortization rates of a downward revision of estimated proved reserves at december  were substantially offset by the adoption of sfas  which reduced dd a rates on the impaired properties 
g a expenses decreased from million in to million in since march  the company has reduced its overhead by implementing certain cost reduction measures  including the closing of its san antonio office  the elimination or reduction of certain professional services  and the control of personnel costs through staff and wage reductions and employee benefit cost controls 
the benefit of these measures was fully realized in exploration costs decreased from million in to million in due primarily to provisions for dry hole costs  impairments of unproved properties and seismic expenses in related to the company s acreage in the sabine area of the trend  its argentina venture and its west and north central texas d seismic program which did not recur in costs of natural gas services increased from million in to million in despite the sale in august of the company s two principal gas gathering and processing systems 
the reduction in costs related to the assets sold was more than offset by the fact that one of the systems sold was acquired effective january and did not contribute to costs in interest expense and other interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher average interest rates on the credit facility 
the effective annual interest rate on bank debt during was compared to in proceeds from the sale of certain natural gas gathering and processing systems in august and the sale of common stock pursuant to a rights offering in september resulted in a slight reduction in average levels of bank debt in the average daily principal balance outstanding on bank debt during was million compared to million in other income increased from  in to million in in august  the company sold certain gas gathering assets for aggregate net proceeds of million  resulting in a combined gain on sale of property and equipment of million  net to the company 
liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary financial resource is its oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the terms of the credit facility  the banks establish a borrowing base  as derived from the estimated value of the company s oil and gas properties  against which the company may borrow funds as needed to supplement its internally generated cash flow as a source of financing for its capital expenditure program 
product prices  over which the company has very limited control  have a significant impact on such estimated value and thereby on the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility 
within the confines of product pricing  the company must be able to find and develop or acquire oil and gas reserves in a cost effective manner in order to generate sufficient financial resources through internal means to complete the financing of its capital expenditure program 
the following discussion sets forth the company s current plans for capital expenditures in  and the expected capital resources needed to finance such plans 
capital expenditures in april  the company plans to indefinitely suspend its trend drilling activities pending an improvement in oil prices  which have fallen to their lowest levels in four years 
through the first quarter of  the company will have spent approximately million on trend leasing and drilling activities  and  depending on the duration of the suspension  may spend up to million in the trend during during  the company plans to spend approximately million on the cotton valley exploratory project to complete the interpretation of its d seismic survey  extend and renew existing leases as required  and drill an exploratory well on one of the cotton valley pinnacle reef prospects generated by such survey 
in addition  the company plans to spend million in on other exploration projects in south texas  louisiana and mississippi 
the incurrence of such costs may adversely affect the company s results of operations in see results of operations compared to costs and expenses 
substantially all of the planned activity is discretionary 
this allows the company to make adjustments to its level of capital and exploratory expenditures based upon such factors as the availability of capital resources  product prices and drilling results 
thus  if the company s ability or desire to conduct the planned activities is diminished or enhanced by any of these factors  the company can modify its expenditures accordingly 
the company does not have any specified amounts of capital expenditures designated for acquisitions of proven properties in however  the company plans to actively seek and evaluate acquisition opportunities and will commit only to those acquisitions which the company can adequately finance through internal and external sources 
capital resources credit facility the credit facility provides for a revolving loan facility in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the borrowing base  as established by the banks  or that portion of the borrowing base determined by the company to be the elected borrowing limit 
at december   the elected borrowing limit was million  and the available credit on the revolving facility was million 
the borrowing base is scheduled for redetermination in may  at which time the company may elect a higher borrowing limit  if such an increase in borrowing capacity is both needed and available 
the company intends to use such borrowing capacity  together with internally generated funds  to finance its planned capital expenditure program 
working capital and cash flow during  the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million and borrowed million on the credit facility 
during the same period  the company spent million on capital expenditures and million to acquire shares of its common stock for treasury 
the company s working capital deficit increased from million at december  to million at december  due primarily to a net increase in current liabilities attributable to increased levels of drilling  leasing and exploration activities 
the company applies most of its available cash toward the repayment of the credit facility 
since all outstanding indebtedness on the credit facility is classified as a noncurrent liability  the timing of receipts and disbursements can cause reported working capital to fluctuate as it did from december  to december  however  working capital will increase as funds are advanced on the credit facility to finance the company s capital expenditure program 
the company believes that the funds available under the credit facility and cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund the company s operations and projected capital and exploratory expenditures during however  because future cash flows and the availability of borrowings are subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production from existing wells  the company s success in locating and producing new reserves  prevailing prices of oil and gas  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s exploratory and development activities 
if such capital resources are insufficient  the company may be required to cease or delay such activities 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues and the value of its oil and gas properties have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the company s ability to maintain adequate borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
in an attempt to manage this price risk  the company from time to time engages in hedging transactions 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations during hedging transactions from time to time  the company has utilized hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
the company uses various financial instruments  such as swaps and collars  whereby monthly settlements are based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of certain futures contracts quoted on the nymex or certain other indices 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  the company receives a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price is higher than the specified price  the company pays the counterparty based on the difference 
the instruments utilized by the company differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation which requires or allows for the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
the company has entered into swap arrangements for  barrels of oil production for the period from january through december at an average price of 
in addition  the company has hedged  mmbtu of its gas production from january through march under collar arrangements with average floor prices of and average ceiling prices of  and has hedged  mmbtu from april through september at an average price of 
year compliance the company has developed a plan to ensure its systems are compliant with the requirements to process transactions in the year and beyond 
the costs associated with final compliance are expected to be minimal
