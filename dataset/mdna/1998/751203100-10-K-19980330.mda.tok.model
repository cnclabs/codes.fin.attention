item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table provides a comparative view of the company s operations in thousands fiscal years ended december  december  december  income loss from operations before restaurant closures and other    provision for restaurant closures and other  income loss from operations    total other expense  net    loss before income taxes and extraordinary item    provision benefit for income taxes extraordinary items  net of tax  net income loss    during  the company experienced an increase of in the loss before income taxes and extraordinary item 
the extraordinary gain  net of tax  of approximately million  or 
per share from the company s early retirement of certain of its outstanding senior notes  at amounts below carrying value  resulted in the company reporting net income for fiscal the transactions involving the senior notes were opportunities created by the company s conservation of cash during the second half of and the depressed market price of the senior notes during the year 
in addition  the transactions resulted in a reduction of net interest expense in of approximately million and 
million as compared to and  respectively 
these transactions are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as more fully discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  the company s effective tax rates on its reported pre tax losses differ significantly from statutory rates  due primarily to concerns as to the ultimate realizability of net operating loss carryforwards 
until circumstances otherwise indicate that realization becomes more likely than not  no additional benefit will be recognized 
as evidenced in the table above  the provision for restaurant closures and other was significantly reduced in and from the prior year levels 
these reductions are primarily attributable to the and early strengthening of the store level economics  which have improved the company s ability to recover  at a minimum  its store level investment and to prior writedowns of underperforming assets  reducing the need at this time for additional writedowns of company assets 
see the section below entitled restaurant closures and other for a more detailed discussion 
the company s income from operations before restaurant closures and other in fiscal declined million from the prior year 
improved restaurant costs of sales in fiscal were offset by continued declining same store sales 
the company continues to refine its turnaround strategy as results show the relative success or the need for reassessment for the various components 
the plan contains four key strategies that are designed to create a consistently profitable environment i strengthen the balance sheet and reduce fixed costs  ii improve store level profitability  iii establish an effective brand positioning and iv pursue various growth opportunities 
the results of and plans for each strategy are more fully discussed below although the company s debt level is still high  the company has made substantial progress in improving its balance sheet and reducing fixed costs 
interest cost was reduced by another million in after decreasing million in  interest was significantly reduced through the retirement of approximately million face value of the company s senior notes in january and an additional million during the fourth quarter of in addition  million in gross proceeds were generated through the company s rights offering completed in september  the proceeds from the offering were used to pay off debt of approximately million and the remainder is being used for new store construction  refurbishment of some existing restaurants and for other general corporate purposes 
outstanding warrants from a rights offering and from a separate issuance of  additional warrants in december   see liquidity and capital resources if exercised  would raise an additional million in cash proceeds 
the company also made progress in disposing of surplus assets in and  as assets held for sale declined by approximately million from the end of on december   the company acquired approximately million shares of checkers drive in restaurants checkers pursuant to an exchange agreement in which the company s common and preferred shares were issued as consideration 
this agreement aligns the company with its counterpart in the double drive thru segment  and enhances the ability to create synergies that will benefit both companies 
this is evidenced by the management services agreement dated november   pursuant to which checkers is providing certain management services to the company 
the agreement creates the opportunity for the company to continue to show key reductions in general and administrative expense 
in fiscal  the company reduced its general and administrative costs by million after a million reduction in the prior year 
the company has made progress in the second key strategy of its turnaround plan  as store level profitability has improved since although the company has experienced a decline in sales during  the decline in restaurant operating margins was only 
much of the improvement since has resulted from the company s cost reduction actions related to food  paper and labor which were implemented in the beginning of the second quarter of and are further discussed in results of operations 
the primary impact of these changes was realized during the third and fourth quarters of and was reflected in the company s store profit margins 
improvement in store level profitability also resulted from the elimination of heavy discounting that drove traffic increases but adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company s third key strategy in its turnaround plan will be the primary focus going into although the company generated net income from operations in and  same store sales have declined during that period 
to combat this negative trend in sales  management believes an effective brand positioning is essential in order to grow same store sales 
during  the company s brand positioning included a bigger  better  burger campaign  which included the introduction of two new premium burgers  new and more impactful menu boards  and new advertising 
the company believes that although elements of this program showed promise  the positioning did not differentiate the company enough to reverse the decline in sales 
therefore  the positioning for has evolved into a campaign focusing on taste  supported by advertising designed to create a point of difference that the leaders in the fast food hamburger segment will find difficult to duplicate 
the final strategy in the company s turnaround plan is to pursue growth opportunities 
in  the company opened nine stores and franchisees opened stores 
in addition to growth in the number of stores  the indoor dining test being conducted in the louisville market may provide customer count growth in existing stores 
the company believes that a well managed double drive thru concept can be profitable  but remaining exclusively in this arena excludes a segment of the population that desires an indoor dining experience 
research has indicated that a segment of the population does not even consider rally s as a place to eat because of the lack of indoor seating 
as of march   the company had five dining rooms in test  where the passenger side drive thru lane had been removed and a to seat dining room was added to the side of the existing unit 
early sales results at these units have been encouraging  however  the company continues to work to reduce the costs to construct these dining rooms in order to improve the return on this investment 
the company also plans to test other dining room designs that could retain the speed of service expected with two drive thru lanes 
further discussion of the factors affecting results of operations is included below 
restaurant closures and other certain charges in fiscals  and have been aggregated and segregated into the caption provision for restaurant closures and other in the accompanying statements of operations 
these items represent estimates of the impact of management decisions which have been made at various points in time in response to the company s sales and profit performance and the then current revenue building and profit enhancing strategies and are discussed in further detail below 
prior to  the company s management had initiated efforts to franchise or selectively divest itself of approximately company owned stores in selected markets 
this strategy was expected to allow the company to concentrate on regaining sales  profit and cash flow momentum in its other markets through stronger focus on a smaller number of its most profitable markets 
the company believed that franchisees would be better able to concentrate on the units that had not been top performers and achieve near term improvements in the performance of those units 
prior to  the company recorded a charge of million which represented an estimate of the difference between the estimated net realizable value  given the then most likely divestiture disposal plan  and the net book value of these restaurants and markets 
early in  six of the units  five of which were in one market  were closed and sublet 
during the third quarter   management concluded that it was unlikely that much of the plan of disposal described above could be executed 
for this reason  the company decided to close up to of the remaining restaurants  resulting in additional charges in the third quarter of of approximately  to reflect additional writedown of the property and equipment to currently estimated net realizable values and approximately million to record reserves for expected future occupancy related costs 
eight of these restaurants were closed as of december  six additional restaurants were closed in the company decided in to continue to operate of these restaurants until such time that the leases have expired or the properties have been sublet 
the company decided to continue to operate the remaining stores previously included in the original restaurants 
with the restaurant closures discussed above and without the burden of impending closure associated with the prior plan regarding these markets  management believes that the markets represent acceptable growth opportunities for future development 
management also decided to close nine non profitable restaurants in certain of its core markets resulting in charges in the third quarter of of approximately million related to the writedown of assets to their net realizable values and million to record expected future occupancy related costs 
seven of these restaurants were closed as of december  the company decided in to continue to operate two of these restaurants  one of which is being operated by cke  as part of a management agreement with the company 
during the third quarter of  charges were recorded of approximately million to dispose of the assets located on eight sites in the houston  texas market which had been operated as company units and then leased to a former franchisee 
the company decided not to refranchise these units due to failure to identify a suitable franchise candidate which management believed had adequate and evident financial resources to successfully open the houston market 
this charge consisted of a writedown of approximately million of the assets to their estimated net realizable values and reserves of approximately  for expected future occupancy related costs 
in  additional modular buildings became unutilized  as expected company development continued to be reduced and decisions were made regarding other restaurant closures 
at december   the company had available for sale substantially completed modular restaurant buildings  which were not expected to be assigned to future company development 
in order to recognize the impact of the additional unutilized buildings and to more competitively price all of the modular buildings available for sale  the company recorded charges of approximately million in the third quarter of and  in the fourth quarter of the charges of million related to third quarter closure decisions  described above  also included approximately million related to an additional writedown on modular buildings which were previously utilized at those locations 
during and  the company sold buildings and buildings  respectively 
during  the company closed six restaurants and during redeployed two buildings for corporate development 
at december   buildings remain available for sale which are being marketed to franchisees and others 
current expectations of net realizable value are based on the company s experience related to marketing the buildings 
the company recorded approximately million in charges in the third quarter of related to further writedowns on excess land idled by slowdowns in the company s expansion plans 
such land had been scheduled to be auctioned during the fourth quarter of these auctions occurred in the fourth quarter and closed in the first quarter of the absolute auctions generated lower than anticipated sales prices  and additional losses of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources  these sales provided cash flow of approximately million  primarily in the first quarter of during the fourth quarter  the sublessee of five of the six sites closed under the november  plan  defaulted on the terms of the sublease agreements  resulting in charges of  related to occupancy and  to reduce the carrying value of the tangible assets to management s estimate of fair value less cost to sell 
due to concerns about obsolescence and abnormal wear and tear associated with transport and storage of surplus equipment  management recorded an  writedown in december  of the equipment s carrying value 
additionally  fourth quarter  charges totaling approximately million were recorded to reflect changes in the estimated net realizable values of the company s remaining surplus assets and properties 
as described above  a substantial portion of the charges in fiscal year related to asset writedowns 
the remainder of the charges related substantially to the establishment of reserves for expected future occupancy related costs 
during  the company revised its estimate of net realizable value for five of its poor performing restaurants in montgomery  alabama based upon an existing agreement to sell the restaurants to a non affiliated restaurant operator 
such change in estimate resulted in a reduction of approximately  in related reserves 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  management decided to reopen three units previously closed and to continue to operate a fourth unit that had been designated for closure  resulting in a reduction in the reserves for future occupancy related costs of approximately  in addition  approximately  in other charges for net changes in estimated asset recovery were recorded during during  the company closed two restaurants and recorded provisions to terminate leases on existing corporate office facilities and revised certain reserves previously established  resulting in net provisions for restaurant closures and other of  such adjustments to the reserves are included in the caption provision for restaurant closures and other on the accompanying statement of operations 
as of december   approximately million remained in the reserve for expected future occupancy related costs which is net of estimated future sublease recoveries 
assets held for sale of million at december  resulting from the actions noted above consist mainly of surplus land  buildings and equipment 
the expected disposal dates for these assets are over the next months 
the carrying amounts of such assets to be disposed of are shown separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the charges described above  results include approximately million of certain charges recorded in the fourth quarter related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
this charge represents impairment of the carrying value of the assets of stores based on management s future cash flow estimates given then current base lines and reasonable trend assumptions 
additional impairment reserves of approximately  were recorded during  primarily related to three underperforming restaurants 
no additional restaurants were determined to be impaired in see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  systemwide sales declined for to approximately million compared with approximately million a year ago

franchisees  exclusive of cke  opened new units  acquired unit from the company  closed units and transferred ownership of restaurants to the company 
restaurant cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for compared with for this decrease is attributable primarily to various cost reduction actions taken during and the second half of management s efforts to improve food and paper costs by implementing tighter operational controls was supplemented by cost of sales reductions realized by cooperating with cke restaurants  inc and checkers to leverage the purchasing power of the three entities to negotiate improved terms for their respective contracts with suppliers 
restaurant operating expenses  the major component of which is labor and related expenses  were of sales for compared with for the improvement is primarily attributable to reductions in management and crew labor that resulted from implemented changes in staffing levels and labor deployment 
the reduction in operating expenses was achieved despite the inclusion of several expense categories that are fixed in nature 
the closing of poorer performing units and the transfer of operational responsibility for certain higher fixed cost restaurants in western markets to cke that occurred on july  enabled the company to show improvement in this category despite the decline in same store sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in due primarily to reductions in the corporate and field operations staff and lower levels of bad debt expense  partially offset by higher legal fees but remained consistent as a percent of revenues due to the reductions in total revenues 
advertising expenses increased approximately million to of sales for compared to for during the first quarter of  the company initiated a new campaign that made greater use of television advertising than in previous years which also contributed to the increased cost 
media expenditures were curtailed during the fourth quarter of as management worked with the new advertising agency on new creative and brand positioning 
depreciation and amortization decreased to approximately million as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to a segregation into owner expense of depreciation and amortization associated with the cke operated properties as of july  and certain assets becoming fully depreciated during owner expense of approximately million for represent the company s segregated ownership cost related to the units operated by cke 
these expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization associated with the properties

of the prior year net amount   related to state taxes expected to be payable and  related to reduction of an irs receivable for a nol carryback to   and  further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see earlier discussion above concerning the extraordinary gain 
fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  systemwide sales declined for to approximately million compared with approximately million in this decrease is attributable to the comparatively lower number of units in operation in and to same store sales declines of systemwide 
the decline in same store sales is primarily due to the lower customer counts experienced upon the elimination of deep discounting programs in the third and fourth quarters of and to the reduced media spending in the fourth quarter of total company revenues decreased to approximately million in compared with approximately million in company owned restaurant sales decreased to approximately million due to fewer company units in operation  a decline in same store sales  and a decline of approximately million due to the company s operating agreement with cke  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources

franchisees  exclusive of cke  opened units and closed units 
five of the company closures which were in the montgomery dma were sold in september  restaurant cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for compared with for this decrease is attributable primarily to various cost reduction actions taken during the second half of  partially offset by higher food and paper costs as a percentage of sales in the first six months of these cost reduction actions include selective changes in some product and packaging specifications as well as renegotiation of purchase terms and selection of alternative vendors 
the increase in cost of sales in the first half of resulted primarily from a carryover of deep discounting programs in the first quarter of and to a shift in product mix sold  reflecting the impact of a larger percent of big buford tm sandwich sales in the first two quarters of compared to the same period of while this product carries a significantly higher dollar profit per unit  it does carry a higher food cost percentage than did the products formerly comprising its share of the total product mix 
the company from time to time negotiates purchase contracts for certain items used in its restaurants in the normal course of business 
although some of these contracts contain minimum purchase quantities  such quantities do not exceed expected usage over the term of such agreements 
restaurant operating expenses were of sales for compared with for the reduction is primarily due to management s cost reduction actions in the labor area and better fixed cost coverage in stores operating during the second half of the year  partially offset by increased bonus costs associated with store management compensation 
this better fixed cost coverage is the result of closing poorer performing units and of transferring operational responsibility for certain higher fixed cost restaurants in western markets to cke 
the identified and implemented changes in staffing levels and labor deployment in certain stores have yielded savings in management and crew labor 
advertising expenses decreased approximately million to of sales for compared to for due primarily to decreases in levels of radio advertising  outdoor advertising  and television advertising

this decrease is caused primarily by reductions in the corporate and field operations staffs  and by lower levels of bad debt and other dead project charges  partially offset by higher legal fees 
depreciation and amortization decreased to approximately million in as compared to approximately million for the prior year

the cash disbursed in payment of the purchase price was reduced by certain amounts owed by the seller to the company 
the company plans to use available cash flow to open additional indoor dining facilities in the number of units to be opened will be dependent on  among other factors  analysis of the five test units  permitting issues  cost engineering issues and available cash flow 
in january  the company repurchased  in two transactions  approximately million face value of its senior notes due in the year the notes were purchased from giant group  ltd

the company is actively marketing the assets included in the caption assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and expects realization in cash over the next months  although actual timing of such cash flows cannot be predicted 
the company expects cash generated from these assets to decline as the amount of assets held for sale decreased from million in to million in the assets contained in this caption are recorded at management s current estimate of fair market value less costs to sell 
there can be no assurances that these values will be realized 
on july   the company entered into a ten year operating agreement with carl karcher enterprises  inc  a subsidiary of cke restaurants  inc collectively referred to as cke

management has plans in place to improve profitability and cash flows from operations 
additionally  management believes that  given the improvements in operating results  the company will realize the positive cash flows from the exercise of warrants discussed in note the company believes existing cash balances and cash flow from operations should be sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations 
the ability of the company to satisfy its obligations under the senior notes  however  continues to be dependent upon  among other factors  the company successfully increasing revenues and profits
