item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of securities act of as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  which are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in those forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those set forth below and the risk factors described in the company s other filings from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
general manchester is a network integrator and reseller of computer hardware  software and networking products  primarily for commercial customers 
the company offers its customers single source solutions customized to their information systems needs by combining value added services with hardware  software  networking products and peripherals from leading vendors 
to date  most of the company s revenues have been derived from product sales 
the company generally does not develop or sell software products 
however  certain computer hardware products sold by the company are loaded with pre packaged software products 
as a result of intense price competition within the computer industry as well as other industry conditions  the company has experienced increasing pressure on per unit prices as well as on its gross profit and operating margins with respect to the sale of products 
manchester s strategy includes increasing its focus on providing value added services with operating margins that are higher than those obtained with respect to the sale of products 
the company has experienced a significant increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily in the form of increased personnel costs  in connection with the implementation of this strategy 
the company s future performance will depend in part on its ability to manage successfully a continuing shift in its operations towards value added services 
the company directly competes with local  regional and national systems integrators  value added resellers vars and distributors as well as with certain computer manufacturers that market through direct sales forces 
in the future  the company may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors 
in addition  certain suppliers and manufacturers may choose to market products directly to end users through a direct sales force rather than or in addition to channel distribution 
some of the company s competitors have  or may have  greater financial marketing and other resources  and may offer a broader range of products and services  than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  benefit from greater purchasing economies  offer more aggressive hardware and service pricing or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other current or potential future competitors 
the company s business is dependent upon its relationships with major manufacturers in the computer industry 
there can be no assurance that the pricing and related terms offered by major manufacturers will not adversely change in the future 
the failure to obtain an adequate supply of products  the loss of a major manufacturer  the deterioration of the company s relationship with a major manufacturer or the company s inability in the future to develop new relationships with other manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s largest customer accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively  substantially all of which revenues were derived from the sale of hardware products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to derive substantial revenues from this customer 
the company s profitability has been enhanced by its ability to obtain volume discounts from certain manufacturers  which has been dependent  in part  upon manchester s ability to sell large quantities of products to computer resellers  including vars 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to sell products to resellers and thereby obtain the desired discounts from manufacturers or that the company will be able to increase sales to end users to offset the need to rely upon sales to resellers 
the markets for the company s products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent introductions of new hardware and software products and services  which render many existing products noncompetitive  less profitable or obsolete 
the company believes that its inventory controls have contributed to its ability to respond effectively to these technological changes 
as of july   and  inventories represented  and of total assets  respectively 
during these same fiscal years  the company s average inventory turnover was  and times  respectively 
the failure of the company to anticipate technology trends or to continue to effectively manage its inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes its controls on accounts receivable have contributed to its profitability 
the company s bad debt expense represented  
and 
of total revenues for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
the company s quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
quarterly revenues and operating results generally fluctuate as a result of the demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies with improved features  the introduction of new services by the company and its competitors  changes in the level of the company s operating expenses  competitive conditions and economic conditions 
in particular  the company currently is increasing certain of its fixed operating expenses  including a significant increase in personnel  as part of its strategy to increase its focus on providing higher margin  value added services 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
as a result of the rapid changes which are taking place in computer and networking technologies  product life cycles are short 
accordingly  the company s product offerings change constantly 
prices of products change with generally higher prices early in the life cycle of the product and lower prices near the end of the product s life cycle 
recently  the computer industry has experienced rapid declines in average selling prices of personal computers 
in some instances  the company has been able to offset these price declines with increases in units shipped 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices will not continue to decline or that the company will be able to offset declines in average selling prices with increases in units shipped 
most of the personal computers shipped by the company utilize operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
the united states department of justice has brought an antitrust action against microsoft  which could delay the introduction and distribution of microsoft products 
the potential unavailability of microsoft products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s chief executive officer entered into an employment agreement with the company under which he received  in compensation  exclusive of fringe benefits  for each of the fiscal years ending july  and in addition  the company s executive vice president received base compensation  exclusive of fringe benefits  of  for the fiscal years ending july  and these officers agreed that they would not be entitled to any bonuses for fiscal and that any bonus payable to either of these officers in fiscal would require the approval of a majority of the independent directors of the company 
no bonuses were paid to these officers in fiscal or the company leases certain warehouses and offices from entities that are owned or controlled by the company s majority shareholder 
each of the leases with related parties has been amended effective with the closing of the company s initial public offering in december to reduce the rent payable under that lease to then current market rates 
year issue many existing computer systems  including certain of the company s internal systems as well as those that the company sells to customers  use only the last two digits to identify years in the date field 
as a result  those systems may not accurately distinguish years in the st century from years in the th century  or may not function properly when faced with years later than this problem is generally referred to as the year issue 
computer systems that are able to deal correctly with dates after are referred to as year compliant 
the company has undertaken a complete and thorough review of all of its operations to determine those aspects which involve or are dependent upon a computer application 
the company is reviewing the software and operating systems for each such application to determine if it is year compliant 
any such system or application which is not year compliant is being modified or upgraded to assure our continued ability to operate without interruption 
this process has been underway since before january  and is currently on schedule for completion before january  the company is in the process of obtaining assurances regarding year compliance from other companies upon which we may rely for products or services 
the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address the year issue 
moreover  the company does not expect the costs associated with that implementation to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
with respect to products sold to customers  the company does not warrant any products sold as year compliant 
instead  the company refers customers to warrantees provided by the product s manufacturers 
the statements above describing the company s plans and objectives for handling the year issue and the expected impact of the year issue on the company are forward looking statements 
those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed above 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  delays in executing the plan outlined above and increased or unforeseen costs associated with the implementation of the plan and any necessary changes to the company s systems 
any inability on the part of the company to implement necessary changes in a timely fashion could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
moreover  even if the company successfully implements the changes necessary to address the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by the failure of others to become year compliant
