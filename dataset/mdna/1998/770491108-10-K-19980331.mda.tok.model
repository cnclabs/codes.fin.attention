therapeutic category gastroenterology in the latter part of  the company and eli lilly and company lilly entered into a series of license agreements pursuant to which the company acquired from lilly certain rights to four developmental compounds designated ly  ly  ly also known as tazofelone and ly collectively  the compounds  which could potentially address some of the unmet medical needs with respect to certain gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome 
each of the license agreements grants the company an exclusive license to develop  manufacture  market and sell the compounds anywhere in the world  except with respect to ly  for which the company is licensed only in the united states and its territories  canada and mexico 
for a description of certain other terms of the lilly license agreements  see license agreements 
tazofelone is being developed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases ibd  including ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease 
a phase ii efficacy trial has been completed for tazofelone  and tazofelone could offer consumers an alternative to existing treatments for ibd which include corticosteroids  asa and azsulfidine 
the other three compounds are being developed to treat functional bowel disorders fbd  including irritable bowel syndrome and non ulcerative dyspepsia 
these compounds could provide an alternative to current fbd therapies which include dietary changes  over the counter laxatives  antidiarrheals  prescription antispasmodics  gastroprokinetics  proton pump inhibitors  ht compounds and antacids 
the company has completed a phase a study of ly the compound is being developed for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and non ulcer dyspepsia 
the phase a single rising dose study was conducted in human volunteers 
the objectives of the placebo controlled study were to show safety across a range of doses and establish a maximum tolerated dose 
the study demonstrated a favorable safety profile with ly being well tolerated across a broad range of doses 
given the positive outcome of this study  the next stage of phase i testing in humans is scheduled to commence in the near term 
therapeutic category cardiovascular in march  the company and pfizer inc pfizer entered into a license agreement pursuant to which the company acquired from pfizer worldwide rights to a compound in development called sampatrilat 
sampatrilat  currently in phase ii clinical trials  is intended to treat essential hypertension and congestive heart failure 
the license agreement grants the company exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  market and sell sampatrilat anywhere in the world 
sampatrilat incorporates  in a single substance  two different but complimentary modes of activity 
it is a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ace and also inhibits neutral endopeptidase which  in turn  results in an elevation of atrial natriuretic factor anf  the body s own natural diuretic 
this dual mode of activity may offer patients and managed care providers the potential advantages of a treatment regime involving fewer drugs  reduced risks  and lower costs in comparison to currently existing therapies 
today  treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension follows a step therapy paradigm with the initial treatment often being an ace inhibitor 
however  normalization of blood pressure may require the addition of a second drug  generally a diuretic  in combination with the ace inhibitor 
this type of step therapy  involving two and sometimes three drugs  may produce side effects comprising the additive adverse reactions of the different products employed 
diuretics commonly employed with ace inhibitors can produce side effects that include potassium depletion  gout  elevated blood lipids  and abnormalities in sugar metabolism 
because anf is a natural diuretic that does not possess these properties  the use of sampatrilat in hypertension or congestive heart failure patients may confer  through the administration of a single drug  all the advantages of a pure ace inhibitor with the addition of greater natruresis thus obviating the separate diuretics 
therapeutic category respiratory maxivent r 
in  the company obtained an exclusive license from abc laboratories of italy abc to develop and market maxivent doxofylline in the united states  canada and japan and  in  obtained a nonexclusive license to develop and market the drug in the united kingdom and ireland

common asthma is a condition involving the periodic constriction of the airways resulting in labored and often painful breathing 
treatment is generally provided by means of bronchodilator drugs which relieve the constriction of the airways and  in turn  the distress of an attack 
the most commonly used oral bronchodilator is theophylline  a drug with good efficacy but which is capable of producing certain undesirable side effects such as disturbances in heart rhythm  central nervous system irritability  convulsions  gastro intestinal distress and excess urination 
phase ii clinical studies and phase iii clinical trials indicate that maxivent appears to be comparable in efficacy to theophylline  however  unlike theophylline  maxivent does not appear to produce a high incidence of adverse side effects 
the company has completed phase iii trials and is reviewing various alternatives for commercialization of this compound  including the outlicensing thereof 
maxivent has been approved for commercial sale in italy and is currently being sold in that country under the tradename ansimar by the company s unaffiliated licensor  abc 
therapeutic category gynecology endocrinology somagard r 
in  the company acquired rights from the salk institute to manufacture and market somagard deslorelin in the united states and in certain foreign countries  including the united kingdom and canada

therapeutic category hematology stanate tm 
in  the company acquired the exclusive worldwide rights from the rockefeller university to develop  manufacture  market and sell stanate stannsoporfin  which is being developed for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates  a condition caused by an accumulation of excessive levels of bilirubin produced by the liver 
unless treated  hyperbilirubinemia can result in jaundice  brain damage and death 
bilirubin is excreted by the liver pursuant to a metabolic step requiring the presence of an enzyme which  studies have shown  is not fully functional in many early term and full term neonates 
stanate is intended to inhibit the accumulation of excessive levels of bilirubin in neonates and to provide neonate enzyme systems with an opportunity to mature and take over the normal elimination of bilirubin 
the most common treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in neonates involves phototherapy which requires exposure to a light source in order to stimulate the temporary excretion of bilirubin by the kidneys 
phototherapy is often not fully effective and requires many hours and sometimes several days of exposure to light with resulting maternal separation  extensive nursing supervision and related time sensitive costs 
in contrast  stanate is administered by injection and clinical studies have shown that one dose is generally all that is necessary for treatment purposes 
stanate is currently in phase ii iii clinical trials 
therapeutic category urology proamatine

the patients enrolled in these trials in the united states and europe were randomized to receive either radinyl in conjunction with radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone 
the results of these studies are currently under analysis 
phase i and phase ii clinical studies are being conducted with radinyl to determine its potential in increasing the effectiveness of other anticancer drugs in the treatment of brain  lung  prostate and bladder cancer and its potential for use with brachytherapy  a technique involving the direct implant of a radioactive source into or adjacent to large tumors 
dirame r 
in  the company obtained exclusive worldwide rights from bayer ag bayer to develop and market dirame propiram  a potent  centrally acting analgesic with low addiction potential intended for use in the control of moderate to severe acute or chronic pain 
see government regulation 
dirame is in phase iii clinical trials which indicate that the compound appears to be safe and effective in patients with various kinds of acute and chronic pain 
a joint venture from which bayer obtained the rights to dirame had initially filed an nda for dirame 
subsequent to such filing  the fda required additional studies regarding the drug 
the company is now addressing the issues raised by the fda and  in  commenced long term carcinogenicity studies on two species of laboratory animals and other clinical studies 
the in life phase of these studies has been completed and the results are currently under analysis 
in order to complete its nda filing the company believes it must complete an additional phase iii clinical trial 
the company plans to commence such clinical trial during somagard 
in addition to the treatment of central precocious puberty and endometriosis  somagard has been studied as adjunctive treatment for prostate cancer 
other treatments for prostate cancer such as surgery and or radiotherapy are often precluded because the cancer has spread to the bones 
as a result  castration  hormonal therapy or chemotherapy are often the only available treatments 
somagard is being evaluated by the company as an alternative to these procedures 
the company has filed a product license application nda equivalent for somagard for treatment of prostate cancer in the united kingdom and has obtained approval from the irish regulatory authorities to market the product for this indication
