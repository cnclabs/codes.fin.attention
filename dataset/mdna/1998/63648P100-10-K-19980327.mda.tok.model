net premiums written represent direct and assumed premiums generated by gpic  less premiums canceled or ceded to other insurers  and adjusted for changes in the reserve for return premiums 
net premiums earned represent net premiums written adjusted for changes in unearned premium reserves 
tracking and outsourcing fees are generated by providing tracking and outsourcing services and are usually based on the number of loans or leases tracked 
net commission income represents commissions received from nonaffiliated insurance companies for lender placed insurance produced by pmsis and from the federal emergency management agency fema for flood insurance written by gpic 
the company s insurance products include lender placed insurance policies which have stated terms of either up to ninety days short term policies or six months to one year longer term policies  most of which are longer term policies 
premiums for longer term policies are recorded as revenues when earned 
the company s lender placed and flood insurance policies are canceled at a relatively high rate because they generally remain in effect only until financial institutions receive proof that borrowers have obtained their own insurance 
at the time the lender placed policies are issued  a reserve is established to provide for return of premiums for anticipated cancellations  which has the effect of decreasing net premiums written and earned premiums 
since  the reserve has been established at approximately to of gross premiums written 
premiums are written directly by gpic or by third party insurance companies in certain states where gpic is not licensed or where its products are not approved 
the following table summarizes premiums written net of cancellations after application of the reserve for return premiums during the periods indicated in thousands for the years ended december  gross premiums written net of cancellations 
   gross premiums ceded    net premiums written    the company s strategy includes expanding its authorization to write premiums on a direct basis and reducing premiums ceded to reinsurers

the company also purchases catastrophic reinsurance  under which the company is protected against an accumulation of losses arising out of any one event up to of million in excess of the initial million of losses which the company incurs 
see business regulation reinsurance and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s reinsurance arrangements 
the company remains primarily liable to its policyholders in the event any reinsurer is unable or will not fulfill the obligations assumed under reinsurance 
as a result of the cost and availability of reinsurance  in the future the company may elect to retain a higher portion of the risk historically ceded to reinsurers 
if the company were to retain a higher proportion of insured risks  it would increase its exposure to significant losses relating to properties insured by the company 
this increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
during  the company ceded non flood insurance losses of  to reinsurers  and for which it has been fully reimbursed 
the company did not cede any losses to reinsurers in or for non flood insurance losses 
the company seeks to limit its exposure with respect to any failure by a reinsurer to fulfill its obligations by evaluating the financial condition and rating of members of its reinsurance pool the company s policy is to purchase reinsurance with us insurers rated in the a categories by us best company at the time of such purchase and by diversifying the reinsurance pool

acquisition on september   the company s newly formed pintax subsidiaries acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of arts 
the acquisition agreement  dated august   as amended the agreement  was entered into by and among arts  the shareholders of arts  the company and new arts 
as consideration for the acquisition of certain assets of arts  new arts paid million in cash  including transaction costs  and agreed to assume certain liabilities of arts 
pursuant to the agreement  if the cash revenue received by the company on certain contracts of pintax exceeds certain targets for the twelve months ending april   the company is required to pay additional consideration of up to million according to a formula as set forth in the agreement additional consideration 
fifty percent of the additional consideration may be paid in the form of a three year note bearing interest at eight percent per annum 
the remaining fifty percent of the additional consideration may be paid in cash 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the pintax acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
as of the purchase date  the fair market value of the assets acquired from arts was approximately million  and the fair market value of liabilities assumed was approximately million  including approximately million of deferred revenue related to arts then existing portfolio of loans 
the amount of goodwill recorded as of the date of pintax acquisition was million  which is being amortized over a year period as a result of long standing vendor and customer relationships 
goodwill is classified on the company s balance sheet under intangible assets 
the majority of tax service revenues earned by pintax are from life of loan servicing contracts  which require customers to pay an up front  one time fee to receive real estate tax services over the life of a loan 
the revenue from life of loan contracts is recognized over the estimated life of the loans in proportion to the amount of expenses incurred to service the real estate property tax tracking on the subject loans 
since the bulk of expenses incurred in providing real estate property tax tracking on the loans occurs in the first year  a majority of the life of loan revenue is recognized within the first year of servicing 
the remainder of the revenue is amortized in accordance with the estimated rate at which loans are paid off or otherwise are removed from the servicing portfolio 
as a result of this revenue recognition policy  pintax records a deferred revenue reserve on its balance sheet 
as of december   deferred life of loan tax servicing revenue was approximately million 
this is approximately the same amount of deferred revenue as of the date of the pintax acquisition 
year compliance the company has considered the potential impact of the year to its computer systems 
through normal  planned enhancements of existing systems  future development of new systems  and upgrades to operation systems and databases already covered by maintenance agreements  some of the company s systems are already year compliant  and the company believes that year compliance will be achieved prior to december  on the balance of its systems 
the company does not anticipate any significant purchases of specific software or hardware  nor does it anticipate the need to engage outside consultants  to achieve compliance 
while management expects some costs associated with compliance  it is anticipated that those costs will not be material 
the accounting treatment of costs incurred solely in connection with year compliance will be treated as period costs and will be expensed as incurred 
the company s customers and companies and others from which the company receives data are also dependent upon computer systems 
it is out of the company s control whether such entities are or will be year compliant  however  the company believes that most of them are aware of the issue

significant customers in  advanta mortgage corp 
accounted for of consolidated revenues of the company 
during the second half of the company received notice that advanta mortgage corp 
and one other customer would not renew their hazard tracking  outsourcing and lender placed insurance contracts 
such customers accounted for of consolidated revenues in  in and in management believes that the decrease in revenue due to the loss of these customers may be delayed and offset  in part  by changes in certain reserves potentially arising from the customers departures  and additional business from new and existing customers 
the decrease in revenue will also be delayed by the rate at which the unearned premium for such customers is earned over the year the company is presently unable to estimate the amount of such offsets  which are dependent upon numerous factors  including  without limitation  the general health of the mortgage banking and vehicle financing industries and of the company s customers  interest rates  general economic conditions  the realization of expected new business from new and existing customers and other factors 
the loss of such customers may affect adversely the results of operations and earnings of the company in additional expenses the company anticipates that it may incur certain costs in in connection with various new business activities  including building its customer base  reorganizing operations and carrying on its product quality improvement programs 
the overall goal of these activities is to enhance the long term value of the company 
the company has begun to hire additional personnel  purchase new computer and other equipment  lease additional office space and incur other expenses in connection with these business activities 
there can be no assurance that such costs will be offset by increases in revenue  and  in any event  the company expects that any increase in revenue will lag the periods in which expenses are incurred 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that the hiring of additional personnel or the reorganizing of operations will lead to higher profitability 
if such increases in expenses are not fully offset by increases in revenue  the company s financial position and results of operations and earnings could be materially adversely affected 
flood zone determinations the company derives a substantial portion of its total revenues from fees for flood zone determination services 
these services are primarily provided to assist lenders in complying with federal laws which in many instances require lenders to determine whether property being financed is located in a federally designated special flood hazard area sfha and require borrowers to obtain flood insurance 
any significant change in federal legislation or secondary market requirements limiting these requirements on lenders or borrowers  or the development by competitors of significantly enhanced service or delivery systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or operating results 
earnings volatility the company s financial results can be significantly affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the amount of net written premium and the rate of cancellation of insurance policies  the addition or loss of customers  changes in the number of loans or personal property leases being tracked for customers  increases or decreases in interest rates  and catastrophic loss events 
for example  in gpic incurred net losses relating to the los angeles riots and hurricane andrew of  and  respectively 
in november  gpic received claims of approximately  from policyholders for losses arising out of the october and november series of fires in southern california 
the company also received an assessment of  from the california fair plan association  a mandatory insurance pool for certain california real estate  relating to losses from those fires 
in addition  revenues from the company s flood zone determination services and real estate tax services are directly related to the volume of mortgage loan originations  both new and refinanced  and any change in the level of such activity could have a material impact on the company s performance 
the number of loans or leases for which the company provides tracking and outsourcing services may increase or decrease depending upon  among other things  the number of new loans or leases serviced by its customers and the volume of loans or leases paid off or sold to others 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting operating results the insurance industry 
the insurance industry the company derives a significant amount of its revenues from insurance premiums and investment income 
in the event that  for whatever reason  gpic experiences abnormally high losses  purchases reinsurance from reinsurers who will not or cannot pay losses submitted  or other adverse developments occur  then any such event or combination of events could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  insurance companies and others have often been sued under certain legal theories  such as bad faith handling or settlement of claims  which could subject gpic to liability in excess of policy limits 
an adverse outcome of any such lawsuit could have a material negative impact on the company 
reserve adequacy gpic is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported losses and incurred but not reported claims 
these reserves are estimates of what gpic expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost  and are based on known facts and circumstances  predictions of future events  estimates of future trends in claims severity and other variable  subjective factors 
no assurances can be given that such estimates will be adequate to cover actual losses incurred by gpic 
any significant changes in gpic s estimate of ultimate losses on reported claims may materially adversely affect the results of gpic s operations in the period reported 
gpic has in the past experienced adverse developments in its loss reserves 
gpic s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are reviewed on an annual basis by unaffiliated actuaries 
gpic s most recent actuarial review of such reserves as of december  concluded that the reserves i met the requirements of the insurance laws of california  ii were computed in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and principles and iii make a reasonable provision for all unpaid loss and loss expense obligations of gpic under the terms of its policies and agreements 
gpic also maintains a reserve for return premiums which is based upon gpic s historical experience 
as is prevalent in the lender placed insurance industry  a substantial amount of gpic s net premiums written are refunded to policyholders 
the amount of such refunds can be affected by  among other things  inaccurate or untimely data submitted by customers  which gpic uses as a basis for recording written premiums or the loss of customers 
no assurance can be given that the reserve for return premiums will be adequate to cover actual refunded premiums paid by gpic in the future 
see  business insurance operations 
underwriting risks traditional insurance companies underwrite risks individually or by class  following an in depth analysis of such risks 
although gpic applies underwriting techniques to a small portion of insured risks  the immediate coverage required by purchasers of lender placed insurance and reo insurance generally requires gpic to write specialized insurance within predesignated limits and geographic areas  at a flat rate  without the application of traditional underwriting criteria to individual risks 
accordingly  gpic may be insuring individual risks that it might not have insured had it applied traditional analysis to such risks 
in addition  gpic may not have adequate spread of risk in a particular geographic area 
see business insurance operations underwriting 
reinsurance considerations gpic s business is partially dependent upon its ability to cede to reinsurers risks insured by gpic 
the amount  availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  beyond the control of gpic  which can affect gpic s level of business and profitability 
gpic is ultimately liable for the reinsured risk if for any reason the reinsurers do not cover or will not pay gpic for the losses of the insureds 
as a result of the anticipated increased cost and more limited availability of reinsurance  in the future  gpic may elect to retain a higher portion of the risk historically ceded to reinsurers 
if gpic were to retain a higher proportion of insured risks  it would increase its exposure to significant losses relating to properties insured by gpic 
this increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations

while to date pinnacle has experienced no significant losses in this regard and maintains reserves equal to its estimate of incurred but unreported indemnification losses  there can be no assurance such reserves will prove adequate in the future

rapid technological change and new products  product delays the markets for the company s information services are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to identify  develop  install and support new services in a timely fashion  and on market acceptance of such services 
no assurance can be given that the introduction of new technologies will enable the company to gain market share  realize cost savings or increase revenues 
shortage of skilled labor the company s delivery and upgrade of products and services to its customers is dependent upon  among other factors  the company s ability to attract and retain key analytical and management professionals  including skilled computer programmers and systems analysts 
businesses located in san francisco  san mateo  contra costa and santa clara counties of california are experiencing a tightening of the local labor market for these professionals  which may result in one or more of the following an increase in personnel costs  a delay in service installations and a reduction in customer service 
the company is unable to predict when the conditions in the local labor market will change
