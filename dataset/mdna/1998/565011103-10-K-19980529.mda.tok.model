item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview manugistics group  inc manugistics or the company develops  markets and supports software products for synchronized supply chain management tm and provides related services 
synchronized supply chain management refers to managing the complex interactions involved in the flows of products through the supply chain 
it involves forecasting product demand and coordinating the timing of distribution  manufacturing  procurement and transportation activities to meet this demand  not only across an entire enterprise  but also among an enterprise and its suppliers and customers 
the company provides an integrated suite of strategic  tactical and operational supply chain software planning products  including a high level optimizer  that address the four key operational areas of supply chain management demand planning  supply planning  manufacturing scheduling and transportation management 
the company derived approximately  and of its revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  from it s supply chain management software and services 
additionally  the company markets and supports the statgraphics personal systems product  which provides statistical tools for quality management in manufacturing companies 
results of operations revenues software products 
the company s software products license revenues increased to approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  from in fiscal  primarily because the company s increased sales and marketing efforts for supply chain management were effective  because of increased market acceptance of such products  and because the company increased its resources devoted to generating software products license revenues more rapidly than its resources for producing services revenues

although the percentage of total revenues represented by software products license revenues has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary  the company anticipates that software products license revenues are likely to represent to of total revenues for fiscal see forward looking statements

software products license revenues increased in fiscal and because of increases in both the number of licenses and the average license fee per transaction 
this growth resulted from increases in the company s sales and marketing resources  increases in the company s sales productivity  higher contributions from the company s international operations which grew to and of total software revenues in fiscal and  respectively  from in  and expansion into new vertical industries 
software products license revenues also increased because of increased market acceptance of the company s products  including its recently introduced products and the latest versions of established products 
this increased acceptance resulted in part from the recognition by prospects and customers that they could rapidly realize significant benefits from effective supply chain management  which led some companies to license more of the company s products or to amend their existing licenses to permit a greater number of users 
the company has historically derived the substantial majority of its software products license revenues from direct sales 
however  the company has embarked on a strategy of expanding its product distribution through alliances with complementary vendors which also led to additional software products license revenues during fiscal and this strategy of developing alliances is still in its early stages and the number of software license transactions involving complementary vendors has been relatively small and has fluctuated 
the company anticipates that software products license revenues derived from indirect sales by these complementary vendors will continue to fluctuate

consulting  maintenance and other services 
revenues from consulting  maintenance and other services increased in fiscal and principally as a result of increased demand for supply chain management consulting and maintenance services from a growing base of customers that have licensed the company s supply chain management software 
fiscal year ended february or  change change in thousands supply chain management    percentage of total revenues personal systems and other  percentage of total revenues total consulting  maintenance and other services revenues    percentage of total revenues supply chain management 
revenues from consulting and other services increased in fiscal and because of new clients licensing increased numbers of products and users  which generally leads to implementation and other consulting services  and established clients licensing additional products and users  which also generates further demand for consulting services 
consulting revenues also increased in fiscal due to additional contributions from the company s international operations  including consulting services provided by employees who joined the company in june in connection with the company s acquisition of synchronology group limited sgl 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
maintenance revenues increased in fiscal and following the increase in the installed base of customers that have licensed the company s software products and entered into maintenance contracts 
maintenance revenues tend to track software products sold in prior periods 
in the past three fiscal years  approximately to of customers with maintenance contracts have renewed these contracts 
personal systems 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues decreased in fiscal and because of a decline in maintenance revenues 
this decline followed the erosion of the installed base of statgraphics users  which resulted from customers and prospective customers having selected competing products  and the company s sale of the assets of its apl plus business in fiscal operating expenses general 
in fiscal  the company plans to continue to incur relatively high levels of both sales and marketing expenditures and product development expenditures as it pursues its strategies of expanding its business into new geographic and vertical markets  expanding its distribution through alliances  and rapidly developing and delivering new product features and functions 
the percentage of revenues represented by these items may vary because the company s total quarterly and annual revenues have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary 
also  the percentages of revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses  product development and the cost of services can be affected by the total amount of expenses associated with new employees and by the timing delays between the dates that these employees begin work and the dates they first become productive after training

cost of software sold includes amortization of capitalized software development costs  and cost of goods and other  which includes royalty fees associated with third party software included with manugistics software that is licensed to customers 
the company amortizes internal computer software development costs over the product s estimated economic life  generally two years  commencing when a product is first available for general commercial release

fiscal year ended february or  change change in thousands amortization of capitalized software    percentage of software products license revenues cost of goods and other   percentage of software products license revenues cost of software sold    percentage of software products license revenues the cost of software sold increased in fiscal and because amortization increased following the general commercial release of additional supply chain management software products for which costs had previously been capitalized  and because cost of goods and other increased 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs has increased in recent years as the company has increased its gross product development expenditures for supply chain management software 
see product development 
amortization also increased because the company wrote off approximately million and 
million in fiscal and  repectively  of capitalized costs relating to the development of certain prior versions of its software products which the company determined exceeded the future net realizable value as a result of new technologies developed by the company or acquired in connection with acquisitions 
cost of goods and other expenses increased in fiscal and primarily because of the increase in royalty fees as the number of licenses to customers involving third party software increased 
cost of consulting  maintenance and other services 
the cost of consulting  maintenance and other services increased in fiscal and primarily because the company added personnel including sgl employees to meet increased demand for its consulting and maintenance services which resulted from the increased demand for the company s software products 
these additional employees helped generate the corresponding increase in supply chain management revenues from consulting  maintenance and other services 
as a percentage of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  the cost of consulting  maintenance and other services increased in fiscal mainly because of the amount of expenses associated with new employees and because of the timing delays between the dates that these employees began work and the dates they first become productive after training 
in fiscal  the cost of consulting  maintenance and other services decreased as a percentage of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues largely because a portion of the increase in corresponding revenues was generated by product maintenance and support  which can be provided more efficiently by serving a larger client base  and because of improved utilization of the company s consulting employees 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal and primarily because the company added sales and marketing resources in north and south america  europe and the asia pacific region  and incurred higher commissions as a result of increased software products license revenues 
in addition  the company incurred costs to establish new offices or build up its presence in certain foreign markets  and increased its marketing expenses in connection with these new foreign markets and with its expanded product offerings see strategy 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal and principally because these expenses increased at a more rapid rate than total revenues 
as it pursues its strategy of expanding its business into new geographic markets  new industries and expanded distribution channels  the company is continuing to hire and train additional sales and marketing employees and to make other sales and marketing expenditures

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal and primarily because of increased expenses associated with supporting an organization with more employees and a greater geographic scope 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal and because these expenses did not increase as rapidly as total revenues  in part because the company was able to leverage its base of administrative resources to support a larger organizational structure 
purchased research and development 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of promira software  inc promira  a provider of supply chain planning software for manufacturers of complex products in industries such as high technology  electronics and motor vehicles and parts 
in that quarter  the company recorded a non recurring charge to operations totaling million million  net of an income tax benefit of million to write off purchased research and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use

other income increased in fiscal primarily due to greater interest income generated from short term investments following the investment of the net proceeds of the public offering of common stock completed in august in future quarters  the investment of these proceeds will continue to generate income  pending their application to other uses 
other income decreased slightly in fiscal over because of slight changes in the various components 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a loss in fiscal as a result of the write off of purchased research and development associated with the acquisition of promira 
as a result of this non recurring charge  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate represented by the company s provision for income taxes was approximately  primarily because the expenses associated with the company s write off of purchased research and development from the purchase of avyx were not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the effect of this write off on taxable income  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been approximately 
management of the company believes that  in fiscal  the effective tax rate of the company on a consolidated basis is likely to be approximately  excluding non recurring charges recorded in connection with acquisitions or other transactions 
this estimate is based on current domestic and foreign tax law and is thus subject to change

the increase in working capital at february  and resulted principally from increases in the company s cash and marketable securities  largely as a result of the company s sale of million shares of common stock in august  the company s cash flows from operations and accounts receivable  which resulted from the increases in software products and services revenues  and which more than offset decreases resulting from the company s payments in connection with the agreement with iri in march  the acquisition of sgl in june and the acquisition of promira in february see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
operating cash flows increased in fiscal primarily because the increase in operating income before non cash expenses including the write off of purchased research and development in connection with the acquisition of promira in february and depreciation and amortization and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and accrued compensation more than offset increases in accounts receivable  non cash expenses and deferred income taxes 
operating cash flows increased in fiscal largely because the cash flows resulting from net income were augmented by increases in non cash expenses and increases in deferred revenues  accrued compensation  other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable  and were not fully offset by increases in accounts receivable 
at february   accounts receivable were million  compared to million at february   primarily as a result of increases in the number and size of software license transactions

the company had expenditures for property and equipment of approximately million in fiscal the company anticipates expenditures for property and equipment commensurate with its anticipated growth in fiscal see forward looking statements 
the company also used cash to acquire promira and sgl  and to enter into an agreement with iri 
financing activities provided cash of million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively

the company accounted for the acquisition as a purchase transaction 
in march  the company entered into agreements with iri the iri agreement relating to the company s possible acquisition of certain assets of iri and the development of a solution that will incorporate iri s point of sale scanner data into the company s supply chain management software 
under the agreements  the company paid million to iri 
under the iri agreements  the company agreed to market iri s point of sale data and received year  exclusive rights among supply chain software vendors in most geographic markets to incorporate these data 
the company and iri agreed to resell certain of each other s products  and the company might acquire certain additional assets of iri subject to the satisfaction of certain contingencies 
as part of these agreements  the company committed that it will generate a minimum of million in revenues for iri from specified products over several years  beginning after the occurrence of certain events 
this commitment is subject to the satisfaction of significant contingencies specified in the agreements 
certain issues have arisen between the company and iri relating to the satisfaction of these contingencies 
the company currently anticipates satisfactory resolution of these issues and believes that it will be able to produce a sufficient amount of qualifying revenues to satisfy its commitment 
however  if the company is unable to generate the minimum annual revenues  to the extent required under the agreements  it will be obligated to pay to iri from its own funds an amount equal to the difference between the qualifying revenues generated and the required minimum  which could result in a material decrease in working capital 
see forward looking statements 
the company has an unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a commercial bank 
under the terms of the facility  the company may request advances in the aggregate amount of up to million 
the company may make borrowings under the facility for short term working capital purposes or for acquisitions acquisition related borrowings are limited to million per acquisition 
the facility contains certain financial covenants that the company believes are typical for a facility of this nature and amount 
this facility will expire in september  unless renewed 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at february  the company is continuing to take steps to ensure its products  internal systems and infrastructure are year compliant 
the company released an enhancement as part of its normal product development efforts to its supply chain management software products in the quarter ending may  that is the company s year compliant release 
in addition  its efforts have included testing  replacing and updating these systems 
based upon actual experience to date  the company continues to evaluate the estimated costs associated with these efforts 
while final cost estimates are not complete  the company presently believes that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the company has expensed approximately  of year costs through fiscal and estimates that it will incur  and  of additional expenses in fiscal and  respectively 
the company investigates potential candidates for acquisition  joint venture opportunities or other relationships on an ongoing basis 
depending on certain factors  including the amount  nature  method and timing of the consideration to be paid by the company  any such acquisitions  transactions or relationships might result in a decrease in working capital 
the company believes that existing cash balances  marketable securities  funds generated from operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated liquidity and working capital requirements for the next to months 
if the company decides to expand its operations more rapidly  to broaden or enhance its products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to respond to market opportunities or competitive pressures  then the company may need additional funds at an earlier time 
the company believes that inflation did not have a material effect on its results of operations in fiscal forward looking statements 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and the business section of this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition  the company may publish or make forward looking statements from time to time relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and strategies  sales and marketing strategies  markets  current and potential competition  technological developments  new products  research and development activities  acquisition activities  partnerships and alliances and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of l provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements in this annual report or elsewhere in the future 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  operating results or financial condition of the company include those set forth above under risk factors and the following revenues for any period depend on the volume  timing and size of license agreements 
the company typically ships software products shortly after license agreements are signed  and  therefore  does not maintain any material contract backlog 
the timing of license agreements is difficult to forecast because software sales cycles are affected by the size of transactions and other external factors such as general domestic and international business or economic conditions or competitors actions 
a small variation in the timing of software licensing transactions  particularly near the end of any quarter or year  can cause significant variations in software products license revenues in any period 
the company believes that the market for supply chain management software is expanding rapidly 
however  if market demand for the company s products does not continue to grow rapidly  because of such factors as adverse changes in domestic or international business and economic conditions or foreign currency exchange rates  the timely availability and acceptance of the company s products  technological change or the effect of competitive products and pricing  software license revenue growth and consulting  maintenance and other services revenue growth  margins  or both could be adversely affected 
if competitors make acquisitions of other competitors or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance the ability of their products to address the supply chain management needs of prospects and customers  or if certain erp or other software vendors that have announced plans to develop or incorporate functionality that could compete with the company s products successfully develop and market such functionality  software license revenue growth could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract complementary software vendors  consulting firms or other organizations that will be able to market the company s products effectively or that will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and services 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with the company and its products  and the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the timing of releases of the company s software products can be affected by client needs  marketplace demands and technological advances 
development plans frequently change  and it is difficult to predict with accuracy the release dates for products in development  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company has recently hired a significant number of employees 
in order to maintain its ability to grow in the future  the company will be required to increase significantly its total number of employees  sometimes in anticipation of increased revenues 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so successfully 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  which supercedes sop sop addresses software revenue recognition and is effective for transactions entered into for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes  based upon its interpretation of sop  that its current revenue recognition policies and practices are materially consistent with the sop in all material respects 
however  guidelines for implementation of this sop have not yet been issued  and the accounting profession is discussing a wide range of possible interpretations of the requirements of sop any such guidelines for implementation  if and when issued  could lead to unanticipated changes in the company s current revenue recognition policies and practices 
such changes could materially adversely affect the company s future reported revenues and earnings
