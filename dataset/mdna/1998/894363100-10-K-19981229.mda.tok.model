included within net sales is revenue that the company earns related to f i products 
the company  through relationships with various national and local lenders  is able to place financing for its customers boating purchases 
these lenders allow the company to sell the loan at a rate higher than a minimum rate established by each such lender and the company earns fees based on the percentage increase in the loan rate over the lender s minimum rate 
the company sells these loans without recourse except that in certain instances the company must return the fees earned if the customer repays the loan or defaults in the first days 
the company also sells  as a broker  certain types of insurance property casualty  credit life  disability and extended service contracts 
the company may also sell these products at amounts over a minimum established cost and earn income based upon the profit over the minimum established cost 
net sales attributable to f i products increased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to higher net spreads achieved in the placement of customer financing  as well as overall increases in the percentage of customers buying these products which is referred to as sell through

the used boat sales from this facility in fiscal were approximately  the company plans to continue to explore the used boat market and potential sites for used boat superstores 
the company discontinued its emphasis on the sales program featuring weekend sales shows in the parking lots of local sam s clubs or certain other large retailers as certain retailers did not allow for the company to display its entire product line which in turn did not allow for maximum sales reach and productivity 
this parking lot program which was initiated with several shows in late  expanded during fiscal to include a full time travelling sales team and participation in approximately parking lot shows primarily during the second and third fiscal quarters which generated net sales of approximately million during fiscal net sales from comparable stores  which had stores included in the base for calculation  increased in fiscal the company relocated or renovated stores and opened or acquired an additional stores during fiscal years and rendering such locations to be excluded from the comparable store base

strong sales typically begin in january with the onset of the public boat and recreation shows  and continue through july 
over the previous five year period  the average annual net sales for the quarterly periods ended march and june represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
with regard to net income  the company historically generates profits in three of its fiscal quarters and experiences operating losses in the quarter ended december due to a broad seasonal slowdown in sales 
during the quarter ended september  inventory typically reaches its lowest levels and accumulated cash reserves reach the highest levels 
during the quarter ended december  the company generally builds inventory levels in preparation for the upcoming selling season which begins with boat and recreation shows occurring during january through march in certain market areas in which the company conducts business 
travis boats operating results would be materially and adversely affected if net sales were to fall significantly below historical levels during the months of january through june 
the company s business is also significantly affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions that are unseasonable or unusual may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels  as well as excessive rain  may affect the company s sale of boating packages and related products and accessories 
see risk factors impact of seasonality and weather on operations 
quarterly results may fluctuate as a result of the expenses associated with new store openings or acquisitions 
the company  prior to fiscal  had attempted to concentrate expansion during the seasonal slowdown generally occurring in the quarter ending december during fiscal  the company modified its acquisition strategy to acquire store locations through out the fiscal year 
this was done to allow the company the opportunity to derive in season sales from the acquisitions as well as to provide a longer period in which to integrate the acquired store s operations 
accordingly  the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of the expected results for any other quarterly period 
liquidity and capital resources the company s short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations including inventory requirements  off season liquidity and store expansion 
these short term cash needs have historically been financed with cash from operations and borrowings under the company s floor plan and revolving credit lines collectively the credit facilities 
at september   the company had working capital of million  including million in cash  million in accounts receivable primarily contracts in transit from sales and million in inventories  offset by approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million outstanding under floor plan lines of credit  approximately million under revolving lines of credit and million in other current liabilities and short term indebtedness including current maturities of long term debt 
contracts in transit are amounts receivable from a customer or a customer s financial institution related to that customer s purchase of a boat 
as of september   the aggregate maximum borrowing limits under floor plan and revolving lines of credit were approximately million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  operating activities utilized cash flows of  due primarily to an increase of million and million in inventories and accounts receivable  respectively 
these amounts were offset partially by an increase in accrued liabilities of  and an increase in accounts payable of million 
of the increase in inventories  approximately million was related to inventory acquired in seven store acquisitions during fiscal and the initial stocking of travis editions product in the newly acquired locations 
in fiscal  operating activities generated cash flows of million due primarily to increased net profits  controlled inventory growth and proceeds received on unearned manufacturer rebate revenues 
management believes that store inventory levels at september  were below standard stocking levels as the company was in the process of contract discussions with its primary outboard motor supplier  outboard marine corporation 
the company was also in discussions with a new alternate outboard motor supplier  mercury marine 
the company could not order outboard motor powered boats until a determination of what type of outboard motor was to be placed on the boat 
the company agreed in principal to agreements with outboard marine corporation and mercury marine in november of and the company has since re stocked its store locations to levels that management believes are historically appropriate 
financing activities in fiscal provided million of cash flows primarily from the net proceeds of borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the company has a million revolving line of credit agented by nationsbank of texas  na 
the line provides for borrowing pursuant to a borrowing formula based upon the certain of the company s inventory and accounts receivable 
collateral consists of a security interest in specific inventories and proceeds thereof  accounts receivable and contracts in transit 
the line has a maturity on october  and pricing is at the company s election of the prime rate minus or on a libor based price structure 
there is a fee on the unused portion assessed quarterly 
a comprehensive loan agreement governs the line of credit 
the agreement contains financial covenants regulating debt service coverages  tangible net worth  operating leverage and restrictions on dividends or distributions 
as of december   million was drawn on the revolving line and the company could borrow an additional million  of which approximately million was immediately available for borrowing based upon the revolving line s borrowing formula 
as the company purchases inventory  the amount purchase increases the borrowing base availability and typically the company makes a determination to borrow depending upon anticipated working capital requirements 
management believes the company to be in compliance with the terms and conditions of this loan agreement 
the company also maintains floor plan lines of credit with various finance companies totalling approximately million in credit limits  which generally have no stated maturity and utilize subsidies from manufacturers to provide for certain interest free periods each calendar year usually august through at least may 
certain floor plan lines of credit with finance companies are governed by loan agreements containing financial covenants concerning  among others  minimum tangible net worth and leverage ratios 
as of december   approximately million was drawn under the floor plan lines and management believes the company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of these loan agreements 
merchandise inventories were million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
accounts receivable increased by approximately million to million at the end of fiscal from a year earlier 
the receivables amount represents primarily contracts in transit generated from sales 
costs in excess of net assets acquired increased to by approximately million to million in fiscal due to the acquisitions during fiscal discussed previously in the section overview 
the company had capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal and included the acquisitions of the store locations discussed previously in the section overview  the renovation of several facilities to the company s superstore standards and expenditures related to the roll out of the company s management information systems in certain store locations 
the company also acquired raw land for the construction of a new superstore location to relocate the roswell  georgia temporary store location 
the fiscal and capital expenditures were primarily financed under the company s credit facilities and additionally with certain individuals and corporations 
the company s revolving credit facility  floor plan lines of credit and internally generated working capital should be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements in the near future 
disclosure of year issues and consequences the year issue yk is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations in the company s point of sale  accounting and other financial operations which could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  could result in a temporary inability to process financial transactions  or engage in similar normal business or financial reporting activities 
similarly  material suppliers to the company may be unable to produce or ship product in the ordinary course of their business operations 
based on recent system evaluations  surveys  and on site inventories  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace minimal portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  as part of a previously planned company wide upgrade to its accounting systems initiated in march of  the company is presently replacing its integrated accounting and point of sale management information system mis 
the new mis system is currently operating in seven store locations and the company is planning to install the system in approximately new store locations by the end of calendar and in substantially each of the new store locations acquired in fiscal the new mis system was selected in part due to its ability to allow the company increased efficiencies in its efforts to further centralize full financial and accounting operations 
the new mis system is a yk compliant system 
the company s existing integrated accounting and point of sale system currently is not yk compliant 
the system s owner  bell howell  inc has notified the company that the system is expected to have a yk compliant version by the end of the first quarter of calendar having the existing software yk compliant before year greatly reduces any risk of delays in implementation of the new system 
however  in the event the bell howell system is not yk compliant by the second quarter of  the company has determined that an immediate evaluation by the company s management and the board of directors will be required to determine if the company should accelerate its planned implementation of the new mis system 
if acceleration of implementation of the new mis system occurs  the company believes it would experience a cost of approximately  in additional travel  training  consulting  personnel and other costs 
if the company discontinued use of its existing system it would also be required to expense all unamortized system costs 
the company has one other key system that is not part of the integrated package 
the company contracts with automatic data processing adp for payroll processing 
adp has provided the company with separate software in which is used to administer the company wide payroll 
the human resources department of the company has just completed installation of a year compliant version which has been provide to the company by adp 
a survey has been performed on all back office software packages 
we have not seen any material date macros or other date related functions that would be materially affected by dates beyond december  significant non technical systems and equipment that may contain microcontrollers which are not yk compliant are being identified and addressed if deemed critical 
this includes  but is not limited to  telephone systems  copiers  fax machines  point of sale credit card authorization terminals 
the company has  and continues to utilize a written questionaire specifically designed to query significant vendors  including but not limited to  boat suppliers  parts accessory suppliers and wholesalers  and financial institutions 
certain of the companies queried have responded to questionaires stating that their systems are yk compliant 
the company is monitoring the status of the questionaire respondants that have indicated that yk compliance is not yet complete  but is anticipated to be complete during calendar year the company has not received any questionaires from companies that have expressed an inability or business related purpose that would render them unable to reach yk compliance 
to date  the company is not aware of any yk issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that significant vendors will be yk ready 
the inability of vendors to complete their yk resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by significant vendors is not determinable 
while the company believes its efforts will provide reasonable assurance that material disruptions will not occur due to internal failure  the possibility of interruption still exists 
in the ordinary course of business  the company has acquired or plans to acquire a significant amount of yk compliant hardware and software 
these purchases are part of specific operational and financial system enhancements with completion dates during late that were planned without specific regard to the yk issue 
these system enhancements resolve many yk problems and have not been delayed as a result of any additional efforts addressing the yk issue 
minimal costs will be associated with yk issue 
the company does not expect the year cost of unforeseen hardware or software applications to exceed  management believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the yk issue in a timely manner 
in the event that the company does not complete implementation of its new system or installation of the yk version of its existing software  it could experience disruptions in its operations 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from the yk issues could also result in a materially adverse affect to the company 
the company currently has assigned two management level employees to further identify risks and to develop contingency plans in the event the company does not complete all phases of the yk program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in april and determine whether formal implementation of such contingency plans are necessary

in april  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effects of adoption must be reported as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
the company expects that the impact of adoption will not be material to its financial position or results of operations 
inflation the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
item a quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   approximately of the company s notes payable and other short term obligations bear interest at variable rates  generally tied to a reference rate such as the prime rate of interest of certain banks 
accordingly  the company s earnings and after tax cashflow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming a two percentage point change in the fiscal average interest rate under the fiscal average of these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s fiscal interest expense would have changed by  and that the company s fiscal net income and after tax cashflow would have changed by  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken such as re financing debt  or seeking lower borrowing costs through adjusting debt maturities and their possible effects  the aforementioned analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
at september   the company has an interest rate protection agreement on million of the million revolving line of credit agreement  calling for a five year fixed interest rate of 
this agreement  the fair value of which is not material at september  and is not expected to become material in the near term  has not been considered in the above analysis
