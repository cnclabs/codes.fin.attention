inflation  economic conditions most of the company s leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include escalation clauses with fixed increases or increased related to changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
the leases may also contain clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its pro rata share of the property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
the company  as a general policy  endeavors to obtain fixed rate financing 
the company s financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which its properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some existing tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s properties are typically anchored by supermarkets  drug stores and other consumer necessity and service retailers which usually offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items 
these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions
