item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since its initial public offering in may  the company has focused on growth through acquisitions 
during this period  the company significantly expanded its international operations by acquiring saevik supply for approximately million in cash  pursuant to a public bid made in accordance with the rules of the oslo stock exchange and acquired supply boats for use in the gulf at an aggregate cost of million 
as a result of this growth  trico is now the second largest owner and operator of supply boats in the gulf and a leading operator in the north sea 
this aggressive strategy of growth through acquisitions  together with increased vessel day rates and strong vessel utilization  has enabled the company to significantly increase total revenues and achieve strong operating results 
the company s results of operations are affected primarily by day rates and fleet utilization 
demand for the company s vessels is primarily impacted by the level of offshore oil and gas drilling activity  which can be influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices and drilling budgets of exploration and production companies  and  to a lesser extent  the market for the maintenance  repair and salvage of existing platforms 
as a result  trends in oil and gas prices may significantly affect utilization and day rates 
the company s day rates and utilization rates are also affected by the size  configuration and capabilities of the company s fleet 
in the case of supply boats  psvs and ahtss  the deck space and liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacity are important attributes 
in certain markets and for certain customers  horsepower and dynamic positioning systems are also important requirements 
for crew boats  size and speed are important factors  and in the case of lift boats  longer leg length and greater crane capacity add versatility and marketability 
the company s day rates and utilization can also be affected by the supply of other vessels available in a given market with similar configuration and capabilities 
the company s operating costs primarily are a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
generally  increases or decreases in vessel utilization only affect that portion of the company s direct operating costs that is incurred when the vessels are active 
as a result  direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization 
in addition to these variable costs  the company incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of its fleet and costs for the routine drydock inspection  maintenance and repair designed to ensure compliance with us coast guard regulations and to maintain abs certification for its vessels 
maintenance and repair expense and marine inspection amortization charges are generally determined by the aggregate number of drydockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period 
costs incurred for drydock inspection and regulatory compliance are capitalized and amortized over the period between such drydockings  typically two to three years

the amended facility is collateralized by a mortgage on certain of the company s vessels 
amounts borrowed under the amended facility mature on december  and bear interest at libor plus a margin that depends on the company s leverage ratio currently approximately 
the amended facility requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and limits the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions

capital expenditures planned for consist primarily of construction costs 
to expand its north sea operations  the company is completing construction of a foot psv that is scheduled for delivery in march and is committed to a three year charter for a uk oil and gas operator 
the company also has entered into a contract to build a foot  technologically advanced ahts with  horsepower that is scheduled to be delivered no later than may expenditures for these vessels are expected to total million in the company also expects to spend approximately million to complete two foot supply vessels  which are currently under construction at a shipyard on the us gulf coast 
the first vessel  which is expected to be completed by july  has been committed to a three year charter to an oil and gas company active in the gulf 
the second vessel is expected to be delivered at the end of the remainder of the company s planned capital expenditures for include i costs to complete the upgrade of two supply boats for the gulf  ii costs to complete the construction of the swath vessel and a supply boat for use in the brazilian market and iii us coast guard drydocking costs 
the company has received a commitment from the maritime administration s title xi ship financing program to provide long term financing for approximately million of the swath vessel s cost 
the company believes that cash generated from operations together with available borrowings under the amended facility will be sufficient to fund the company s currently planned capital projects and working capital requirements 
the company s strategy  however  is to make other acquisitions and to selectively construct new special purpose vessels as part of an effort to expand its worldwide presence 
to the extent the company is successful in identifying such opportunities  it most likely will require additional debt or equity financing depending on the size of the investments required 
during the company began an evaluation of its existing software systems to determine which computer programs need to be upgraded or modified to become year compliant 
the company has determined that the cost to upgrade or modify those software systems which are not already year compliant will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  operations or cash flows 
currency fluctuations as a result of the growth in the company s international operations  especially following the acquisition of saevik supply  the company is exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
all charter contracts and indebtedness of the company s north sea subsidiaries are denominated in either norwegian kroner  british pounds or danish kroner 
the company is unable to predict the effect of fluctuations in these currencies  but a significant decline in their value relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition
