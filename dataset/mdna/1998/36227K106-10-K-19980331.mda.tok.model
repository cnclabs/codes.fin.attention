item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
international sales and operations 
sales of products and the provision of services to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal year the company anticipates that international sales and services will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company may be subject to certain risks  including risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export including export of high technology products or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy and risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations 
additional risks include potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs  quotas and other barriers  potential difficulties involving the company s strategic alliances and managing foreign sales agents or representatives and potential difficulties in accounts receivable collection 
the company currently sells products and provides services to customers in emerging market economies such as russia  ukraine  bulgaria  and the czech republic  as well as customers in countries whose economies have suffered in the recent asian financial crisis 
the company has taken steps designed to reduce the additional risks associated with doing business in these countries  but the company believes that such risks may still exist and include  among others  general political and economic instability  lack of currency convertibility  as well as uncertainty with respect to the efficacy of applicable legal systems 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the company s ability to expand its business into certain emerging international markets is dependent  in part  on the ability of its customers to obtain financing 
revenues in the nuclear power industry 
although  the company has reduced its reliance on the development of large application systems having multi year delivery schedules  such as full scope nuclear power plant simulation projects  the company will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from customers in the nuclear power industry  particularly the international nuclear power industry  for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to supply nuclear power plant simulators and related products and services is dependent on the continued operation of nuclear power plants and  to a lesser extent  on the construction of new nuclear power plants 
a wide range of factors affects the continued operation and construction of nuclear power plants  including the political and regulatory environment  the availability and cost of alternative means of power generation  the occurrence of future nuclear incidents  general economic conditions and the ability of customers to obtain adequate financing 
revenues in the chemicals industry 
the company derives a portion of its revenues from companies in the chemicals industry 
accordingly  the company s future performance is dependent to a certain extent upon the demand for the company s products by customers in the chemical industry 
the company s revenues may be subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of industry cycles  as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors affecting spending by companies in the company s target process industries 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product development and technological change 
the company believes that its success will depend in large part on its ability to maintain and enhance its current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer needs 
the company s product development activities are aimed at the development and expansion of its library of software modeling tools  the improvement of its display systems and workstation technologies  and the advancement and upgrading of its simulation  process control and data acquisition technologies 
the life cycles for software modeling tools  display system software  process control  data acquisition and simulation technologies are variable and largely determined by competitive pressures 
consequently  the company will need to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance and expand its capabilities in these areas and to maintain its competitive advantage 
the company s products are offered in markets affected by technological change and emerging standards which are influenced by customer preferences 
the company has expended significant resources in developing versions of its core products which operate in the increasingly popular windows nt environment  however  there can be no assurance of customer acceptance of these windows nt based products or that these products will be competitive with products offered by the company s competitors 
although the company believes that no significant trends to migrate to other operating platforms currently affect the markets for the company s products  there can be no assurance that customers will not require compatibility with such other operating platforms in the future 
intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are important to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position  the company s business depends  in part  on its intellectual property rights in its proprietary technology and information 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark law  contractual arrangements and technical means to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants  joint venture and alliance partners  customers and other third parties that are granted access to its proprietary information  and generally limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company has protected or will be able to protect its proprietary technology and information adequately  that the unauthorized disclosure or use of the company s proprietary information will be prevented  that others have not or will not develop similar technology or information independently  or  to the extent the company owns patents  that others have not or will not be able to design around those patents 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are sold do not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
competition 
the company s businesses operate in highly competitive environments with both domestic and foreign competitors  many of whom have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
the principal factors affecting competition include price  technological proficiency  ease of system configuration  product reliability  applications expertise  engineering support  local presence and financial stability 
the company believes that competition in the simulation and process automation fields may further intensify in the future as a result of advances in technology  consolidations and or strategic alliances among competitors  increased costs required to develop new technology and the increasing importance of software content in systems and products 
the company believes that its technology leadership  experience  ability to provide a wide variety of solutions  product support and related services  open architecture and international alliances will allow it to compete effectively in these markets 
as the company s business has a significant international component  changes in the value of the dollar could adversely affect the company s ability to compete internationally 
emergence of new requirements 
the company is aware of general industry concerns that software products provide consistent operation through and after the year the company has established a compliance program to test and  if necessary  modify new versions of its products which are designed for use in connection with applications for actual plant operations 
an evaluation of the company s products which are not designed for use in connection with actual plant operations has also been commenced 
any failure or delay in testing and or modifying its products to be year compliant could affect the company s competitive position or lead to product obsolescence 
reliance on key technical and executive personnel 
the company s operations are dependent on the efforts of its technical personnel and its senior management 
thus  recruiting and retaining capable personnel  particularly engineers  computer scientists and other personnel with expertise in computer software and hardware  are critical to the future performance of the company 
competition for qualified technical and management personnel is substantial  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to continue to operate profitably 
certain of the company s senior executives are subject to employment agreements which include noncompetition covenants 
although the company s other key personnel are not generally subject to long term employment or noncompetition agreements  they are subject to standard confidentiality agreements 
legal liability 
the company s business could expose it to third party claims with respect to product  environmental and other similar liabilities 
although the company has sought to protect itself from these potential liabilities through a variety of legal and contractual provisions as well as through liability insurance  the effectiveness of such protections has not been fully tested 
the failure or malfunction of one of the company s systems or devices could create potential liability for substantial monetary damages and environmental cleanup costs 
such damages or claims could exceed the applicable coverage of the company s insurance 
although management has no knowledge of material liability claims against the company to date  such potential future claims could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
certain of the company s products and services are used by the nuclear power industry  although the company believes that it does not have significant liability exposure associated with such use as nearly all such products and services relate to training  and although the company s contracts for such products and services typically contain provisions designed to protect the company from potential liabilities associated with such use  there can be no assurance that the company would not be materially adversely affected by claims or actions which may potentially arise 
influence of affiliate stockholders 
as of the date of this report  certain directors  executive officers and other parties which are affiliates of the company own in excess of of the common stock of the company 
if these stockholders vote together as a group  they will be able to effectively control the business and affairs of the company  including the election of individuals to the company s board of directors  and the outcome of actions which require stockholder approval 
item properties 
as of the date of this report  gse systems maintains its headquarters and leases a facility of approximately  square feet in columbia  maryland 
however  in order to better meet the company s expected facilities requirements for the foreseeable future  the company has entered into commitments whereby the lease for its existing columbia facility will be terminated and the operations presently occupying such facility are scheduled to relocate into two separate facilities during the second quarter of  one of these facilities will be in columbia  maryland approximately  square feet and will be occupied by the company s corporate headquarters offices  the operations of power systems  as well as various other company operations  the other facility will be in baltimore  maryland approximately  square feet and will be occupied by the operations of process solutions 
each of the leases for these smaller facilities has a term of ten years 
in addition  the company also leases office space domestically in arizona  georgia  louisiana  texas  pennsylvania  new jersey  north carolina  and utah  as well as in belgium  japan  korea  singapore  sweden and taiwan 
the company leases these facilities for terms ending between and item legal proceedings 
in december  power systems  ryan  and certain individuals affiliated with ryan reached a comprehensive settlement of the previously reported lawsuit pending among them  pursuant to this settlement  power systems acquired all the capital outstanding stock of ryan and all claims among the parties were dismissed 
see item business background 
various other actions and proceedings are presently pending to which the company is a party 
in the opinion of management  the aggregate liabilities  if any  arising from such actions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders 
no matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter ended december  part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for the common stock reported by the nasdaq national market system 
high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter there were approximately holders of record of the common stock as of march  based upon information available to it  the company believes there are approximately beneficial holders of the common stock 
the company has never declared or paid a cash dividend on its common stock 
the company currently intends to retain future earnings to finance the growth and development of its business  and therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company believes factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations and announcements of new products by the company or by its competitors may cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate  perhaps significantly 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the company s common stock has also experienced a relatively low trading volume  making it further susceptible to extreme price fluctuations 
these factors may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in  the company granted one of its senior executives a stock option to acquire  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
in  in exchange for services  the company granted stock options to two consultants to acquire  shares of common stock in the aggregate at an exercise price of 
none of the aforementioned stock option grants were made pursuant to the company s long term incentive plan 
such transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to section thereunder

the first line for million is guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states exim  is collateralized by power systems contract receivables and inventory  and provides for borrowings up to of eligible receivables and of unbilled receivables 
the second line  also for million  is collateralized by substantially all of process solutions assets  and provides for borrowing up to of eligible receivables and of inventory not to exceed 
the lines require the company to comply with certain financial ratios and preclude the company from paying dividends and making acquisitions beyond certain limits without the bank s consent 
in november  the process solutions line was amended to permit the use of loan proceeds to support the working capital needs of erudite software 
in connection with this amendment  erudite software became fully liable for amounts outstanding under the line and substantially all of its assets were pledged as collateral 
in march  the company entered into agreements with the bank whereby each of the power systems and process solutions lines of credit was conditionally extended through june  and a temporary million over advance limit was established for the process solutions line

the power systems line continues to bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus  as the case may be 
although the company was not in compliance with its cash flow coverage ratio or minimum tangible net worth ratio covenants as of december   the company has received a written waiver of such covenants from its bank

during the year ended december   the company generated a net loss of million 
the company s credit facilities expire at june   and currently the company does not have the financial wherewithal to repay these loans 
the company plans to reduce its borrowings through the proceeds from the sale of erudite software  which sale the company is currently actively pursuing 
further  the company is exploring other options to enhance its liquidity through an additional restructuring of its operations 
although the company intends to seek to renegotiate or replace its expiring credit facilities in connection with these liquidity enhancing actions  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to the company  or if available  will be on terms favorable to the company 
in the event that the sale of erudite software does not result in sufficient proceeds to meet the company s current obligations as they become due  or in the event that the sale of erudite software does not occur before june   certain of the company s principal stockholders mantech and gp strategies have agreed to provide working capital support to the company through credit enhancements  a portion of which is subject to bank approval which is expected to be received  or by taking actions that would result in additional liquidity to the company 
although the specific form s of this working capital support has not yet been determined  such support may be in the form of credit enhancements  corporate guaranties and or purchases of certain of the company s assets 
management believes that the above actions will result in sufficient liquidity and working capital resources necessary for planned business operations  debt service requirements  planned investments and capital expenditures 
although the terms of the aforementioned credit working capital support arrangements have not yet been determined  such arrangements could have a dilutive effect on the interests of other holders of the company s common stock 
foreign exchange 
a portion of the company s international sales revenue is received in a currency other than the currency in which the expenses relating to such revenue are paid 
the company manages its foreign currency exposure primarily by entering into foreign currency exchange agreements and purchasing foreign currency options 
the former requires the company  on a specified date or during a specified period  to exchange a set amount of foreign currency for united states dollars or another base currency 
the latter provides the company with the option to exchange foreign currency for united states dollars or another base currency on a specified date or during a specified period 
the company utilizes these foreign exchange agreements and options only to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on its operating results and does not engage in foreign currency speculation 
foreign exchange contracts do not expose the company to material risk because any losses on the contracts are calibrated to be offset by gains on the value of the foreign receivables being hedged 
foreign exchange options do not expose the company to material risk since the company has the right not to exercise the option 
at december   the company had forward option contracts of  to hedge future german mark receipts and the company s swedish subsidiary had forward exchange contracts of swedish krona million  or approximately  to hedge future japanese yen and german mark receipts 
gains and losses on such contracts are recognized as part of the cost of the underlying transactions being hedged 
foreign exchange contracts have an element of risk that the counterparty may not be able to meet the terms of the agreement 
however  the company minimizes such risk exposure by limiting counterparties to nationsbank and nordbanken ab 
management believes that the risk of incurring such losses is immaterial 
the company has also entered into foreign exchange option contracts with nationsbank  which permit  but do not require  the company to exchange foreign currencies at a future date with the bank at a contracted exchange rate 
costs associated with such contracts are amortized over the life of the contract matching the underlying receipts
