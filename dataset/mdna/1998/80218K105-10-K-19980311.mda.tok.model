the company has expended significant financial and managerial resources to comply with such regulations 
although the company believes its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas operations 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from the company s operations  could result in significant costs and liabilities in the future 
as it has done in the past  the company intends to fund its cost of environmental compliance from operating cash flows
