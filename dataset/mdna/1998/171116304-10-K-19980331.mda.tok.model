overview the company was formed in to research and develop and to commercialize intellectual properties for marketing to a variety of industries  including  but not limited to  the medical  dental  biological  cosmetic  hair color  beauty aid and fashion industries 
the intellectual properties relate to the application of color science technology to the scientific measurement and analysis of human skin  tissue  fluid  hair  teeth or biological subject  the classification of such measurements  the detection and monitoring of conditions affecting the coloration of such human skin  tissue  fluid  hair  teeth or biological subjects and the scientific classification and color oriented organization of various consumer sensitive products such as cosmetics  tooth enamel  hair color  hosiery  fashion  textiles  etc 
the company has incorporated certain of the intellectual properties into a proprietary color measurement system and software marketed for various commercial applications as the colormate tm system 
the company has developed intellectual properties which it believes are capable of detecting and monitoring chromogenic diseases 
in this regard  the company developed the colormate tm bilirubin device to measure the incremental increase of the yellow content of the skin color in newborns to monitor bilirubin infant jaundice 
on july  the company received fda clearance for commercial marketing of the colormate tm bilirubin device for the non invasive monitoring of bilirubin infant jaundice in newborns 
the company s efforts are currently focused on seeking to commercialize this medical application of its intellectual properties for non invasive detection and monitoring of bilirubin infant jaundice 
the company has also developed its own line of scientifically color coordinated proprietary cosmetics my colors by chromatics tm and scientifically color coordinated proprietary color charts and material swatchpacks for use in the cosmetics  beauty and dental and fashion industries 
to date  the company s marketing activities have principally involved licensing the intellectual properties  including conducting laboratory product chromaticity studies  leasing the colormate tm system and marketing the beauty aid products in the cosmetic  hair color  beauty aid and fashion industries i in a national sales program with avon  and in limited test markets with clairol and hanes  all conducted prior to june  ii under current agreement with gordon laboratories and certain leasing and licenses to beauty related businesses and beauty salons 
although the company from time to time is engaged in preliminary discussions including limited consumer testing and laboratory chromaticity study activities for use of its technology in the cosmetics  dental and beauty aid fields  there can be no assurance that any final agreements will be reached 
in this regard  the company has recently completed research and development for the working prototype of a hand held less expensive led model of the colormate tm system the colormate tm led device which the company anticipates will enhance its marketing efforts 
in  the company furthered implementation of its long range plans to exploit certain medical applications for its technology 
in this regard  the company submitted a marketing application for its colormate tm unit for a certain medical applications with the fda on november  the application  known as a premarket notification or k submission  was accepted officially for filing and review by the fda on november  the application requested  and on july   the company received from the fda s cdrh  marketing clearance pursuant to a substantial equivalence determination order  in the form of a letter dated july   authorizing the company to commercially distribute its colormate tm bilirubin device for non invasive detection and monitoring of bilirubin infant jaundice in the united states 
see business  and risk factors 
since inception the company has financed its operations through i private placements of its securities  ii collaborative research and development arrangements with licensees  iii cash receipts from lease and licensing agreements  iv loans from private investors and certain shareholders  v the february initial public offering the ipo and vi the proceeds of exercise of stock options and warrants 
over the past two years  the company has used substantial portions of the proceeds of such exercise and from the private placement in and of its securities to further its long range business plan with respect to the medical application of its technologies and for the development of the colormate tm units  including a transcutaneous bilirubinometer 
the company has incurred significant research and development and marketing expenses since inception  resulting in losses from operations since and  prior to its ipo  negative shareholders equity 
in particular  over the past two years  the company has incurred significant fda related expenses and research and development and marketing start up expenses relating to the bilirubin infant jaundice medical application 
the company also has not achieved significant operating revenues from marketing its intellectual properties products and colormate tm units in the cosmetic and beauty aid industries since termination of the avon project in  and has never generated any revenue from licensing its intellectual properties or the colormate tm system in any industry other than the cosmetics  haircolor  beauty aid and fashion industries 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the foregoing factors raise substantial doubt as to the company s ability to generate profitable operations 
see risk factors 
since limited revenues have been derived from licenses  leases  service contracts and beauty aid product sales to several beauty related businesses  testing and laboratory fees from potential licensees evaluating the company s technology  and from an exclusive licensing and lease contract with ims 
in  the company did not generate any lease  license and service contract revenues from ims 
from december  until the ipo  the company had been primarily engaged in a pursuing the company s litigation against avon  b developing and testing further applications of the intellectual properties and colormate tm units  such as the clinical research studies for medical applications  and c obtaining additional financing to support marketing of the company s intellectual properties  systems  beauty aid products and related services 
the company s ability to generate revenues in the future will depend on its success in marketing its intellectual properties  the related chromaticity studies capabilities  the colormate tm bilirubin device  the colormate tm units and the beauty aid products 
if such marketing is not successful in the future  the principal effect would be a write down of the book value of the colormate tm units and an impairment of the company s ability to obtain future financing  which could result in a diminution in the value of an investment in the company 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to timely place such units or identify alternative markets

the company incurred research and development expenses primarily consisting of compensation of officers  employees and consultants of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the loss was mitigated by the capitalization of  of software development costs  decreased fda medical application costs  and a decrease in other expenses described below 
see note of notes to financial statements for a discussion of the effect on net losses and net losses per share attributable to i the company s outstanding convertible securities and ii accounting for stock based compensation on the intrinsic value method  rather than the fair market value method 
the company believes that the level of expenses relating to the fda application and related patent applications will not be recurring in the future at previous levels and that any future expenses incurred in connection therewith will be significantly less than the amount incurred in  although no assurance can be given of such result 
bad debt expense decreased to  in from  in primarily attributable to the adjustment of amounts due from ims in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  in from  in  primarily attributable to the amortization of deferred legal expenses incurred in in respect of financing activities

see notes and of notes to financial statements 
revenues from lease  license and service contracts decreased in as the company continued to focus its resources on implementation of its long range business plan for medical applications of its technologies 
the company receives payments from licensees  distributors or other sources sporadically during the year 
accordingly  these payments have had  and payments that may be received in the future will have  a significant impact on quarter to quarter comparisons inasmuch as the company has not developed stable recurring revenues 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur substantial and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future as increased expenses are incurred in implementing its long range business plan for medical applications of its technologies and as revenues from the company s existing activities in the cosmetics  beauty aid and fashion areas are anticipated to continue to be insignificant relative to its anticipated expenses in the foreseeable future 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company incurred net losses of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  as revenues received have not been significant relative to the company s expenses incurred in implementing its business plan 
the  increase in such losses in as compared to is primarily attributable to  of expenses incurred to prepare and complete the company s fda application and related patent application   in patent applications costs including related research and development expenses  write offs of uncollectible receivables and certain inventory  expenses for compensation of officers and employees  and legal fees and deferred costs incurred in connection with the company s financing activities and potential acquisition activities

the company has applied a substantial portion of the proceeds of the private placement and debenture financing to continue its implementation of its long range business plan for commercialization of its technologies for medical applications in diagnosing certain diseases  including the completion of the fda application and the related patent applications 
in this regard  the company hired fda and governmental regulatory consultants in addition to legal counsel to assist in obtaining marketing regulatory clearances for such medical applications and is currently applying for foreign regulatory approvals of commercial use of its technology for the detection and monitoring of bilirubin infant jaundice 
the company anticipates that any initial penetration of the medical marketplace will be accomplished through the relationships with specialized distributors  rather than through a direct sales force 
management believes that  if its proposed marketing plans for non medical applications of its technology are successful  then it will generate revenues from fees from the licensing of the intellectual properties and leasing of the colormate tm units  sales of swatch packs  consulting fees  and sales of cosmetics  although there can be no prediction or assurance as to which or any of these potential revenue sources will be successful 
however  since consummation of the ipo  the company s marketing of its intellectual properties  beauty aid products and colormate tm units in the beauty aid industry have resulted in immaterial revenues 
as of december   management expects that the company will have sufficient liquidity at least until december   even if no revenues from operations are generated 
if the company is able to profitably market its intellectual properties  the colormate tm units  the colormate tm bilirubin device and beauty aid products  the company would use any cash flow obtained from operations  and may seek additional debt or equity financing  to further support and expand its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding 
if the company has not been able to attract additional future financing at such point in time it may have to cease operations
