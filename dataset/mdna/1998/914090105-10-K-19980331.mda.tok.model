competition community banking  ann arbor the bank s attraction and retention of deposits depends on its ability to provide investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of investors with respect to rate of return  liquidity  risk and other factors 
the bank competes for these deposits by offering competitive rates  personal service  a variety of savings programs  tax deferred retirement programs and foreign currency deposits 
the bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges  the quality of services it provides to its loan customers  and the range of services it offers 
the bank s competition in originating loans comes principally from other commercial banks  credit unions  insurance companies and savings and loans 
the following table shows market share of deposits for washtenaw county by financial institution for june and june from the fdic s annual branch deposit survey june data is not yet available washtenaw county financial institution deposits change great lakes bancorp first of america bank nbd first chicago bank comerica bank key bank republic bank standard federal fsb citizens bank chelsea state bank university of michigan cu michigan natl bank huron river area cu ann arbor commerce bank hospital health services cu automotive fcu charter one bank of ann arbor old kent university credit unions  s l total deposits bn total deposits in the county declined from june to june in attracting deposits  the bank s primary competitors are other commercial banks  credit unions and savings and loans operating outside of the upper peninsula of michigan 
at year end  the bank had approximately  in retail deposits from washtenaw county  which is approximately a market share 
the bank s main office is adjacent to the university of michigan hospital complex 
the complex employs a total of  persons 
the nearest competitors to the bank s main office are first of america bank and hospital health services credit union 
the bank s main office was formerly the headquarters of the latter credit union  which moved its office to a new office building three miles from the complex 
the ann arbor banking market is dominated by banks which are owned by out of area holding companies 
in the city of ann arbor  the university of michigan credit union is the largest locally owned financial institution 
the only locally owned community financial institutions  excluding university bank  are the hospital health services credit union and bank of ann arbor  a new start up bank 
mortgage banking origination 
the bank s ann arbor community bank  varsity mortgage and to a lesser extent varsity funding s retail origination offices purchase or originate internally residential home loans which generally qualify for sale to secondary market investors under the underwriting criteria of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or the federal national mortgage association fnma from correspondents in michigan and in the eastern united states 
loans purchased or originated internally are either sold directly to fhlmc or fnma  or are pooled into mortgage backed securities and the securities are sold to investors in the secondary market 
the bank s retail mortgage origination operations encounter competition for the origination of residential real estate loans primarily from savings institutions  commercial banks  insurance companies and other mortgage banking firms 
many of these firms have a well established customer and or borrower client base 
some competitors  primarily savings institutions  insurance companies and commercial banks  have the ability to create unique loan products from time to time because they are able to close the loans for their own portfolio rather than sell into the secondary market 
most loans sold into the secondary market  however  go to the same sources  those being federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and government national mortgage association gnma guaranteed securities 
most lenders have access to these secondary market sources  therefore  competition often becomes more a matter of service and pricing than that of product 
as a mortgage loan originator and a purchaser of mortgage loans through correspondents  the bank and its affiliates must be able to compete with respect to the types of loan products offered by competitors to borrowers and correspondents  including the price of the loan in terms of origination fees or fee premium or discount  loan processing costs  interest rates  and the service provided by the bank s staff 
during lower interest rate environments  competition for loans is less intense due to the large number of loans available for origination 
as interest rates rise and the number of loans available for origination diminishes  competition becomes quite intense and companies with larger investor bases  flexibility with respect to type of product offered and greater experience in dealing in these types of markets tend to be the most successful 
the bank also originates residential loans to be held in portfolio  and management believes that this product together with the product offerings which fhlmc and fnma have is sufficient for its competitive needs 
although the bank is currently licensed as a hud title  title and multifamily seller servicer  it has no plans at this time to expand its utilization of hud or gnma programs 
however  varsity funding recently initiated a gnma single family retail lending capability utilizing the bank s hud seller servicer licenses 
the bank and varsity funding also are correspondents for several impaired credit conduits and sell this type of residential mortgage on a non recourse  servicing released basis 
varsity funding operates in similar fashion to varsity mortgage and the bank s ann arbor community bank  in that it purchases or originates internally residential home loans which generally qualify for sale to secondary market investors under the underwriting criteria of a wide variety of secondary market correspondents in michigan and the midwest united states 
loans purchased or originated internally are either sold directly to private conduits  or are pooled into mortgage backed securities and the securities are sold to private conduit investors in the secondary market 
varsity funding s retail origination operation also sells secondary market conforming loans to varsity mortgage on a correspondent basis 
varsity funding competes primarily with other mortgage banking firms  insurance companies  commercial banks  and savings and loans 
the bank s accounting department continues to administer the bank s table funding mortgage broker lending operation from the ann arbor office 
by providing working capital funding for mortgage bankers  the bank is able to earn interest income on the amount of loans outstanding at any given time 
the bank competes in providing this service on interest rate and service 
the bank encounters competition in table funding of mortgage brokers primarily from savings institutions  commercial banks  insurance companies  other mortgage banking firms and wall street broker dealer conduits 
varsity funding and varsity mortgage are the bank s largest tablefunding customers 
mortgage subservicing and servicing 
the bank currently retains of all fhlmc and fnma mortgage servicing rights originated or purchased to date 
in the third quarter of  the bank sold of its portfolio of accumulated servicing rights to reduce its investment in this class of asset for a gain of  in the third quarter of  the bank sold an additional of its accumulated portfolio at no significant gain 
servicing competition is somewhat less intense than the loan origination aspect of mortgage banking 
due to net worth and management requirements  many mortgage origination companies do not have the capacity to service loans 
falling interest rates present competitive challenges for the mortgage servicing operation in that mortgagors are more likely to refinance existing mortgages 
the quality of service and the ability of the origination operation to compete on price and service is important in retaining such customers by refinancing them internally  rather than losing the refinancing transaction to a competitor 
increased refinancing activity as a result of falling interest rates should decrease profitability of mortgage servicing by increasing amortization charges on purchased mortgage servicing rights 
in the subservicing business  midwest loan services competes primarily with a small group of specialized servicing units of mortgage banking companies  and a few specialized units owned by banks and savings and loans 
most of these companies have substantially larger financial resources than midwest loan services 
midwest loan services is located in houghton  michigan in the western upper peninsula of michigan 
personnel and occupancy costs are the largest costs in a mortgage servicing operation  and the prevailing wages and occupancy costs in the upper peninsula of michigan are substantially below the national average 
as a result  the company believes that midwest loan services mortgage servicing operation potentially offer its mortgage banking operations a competitive advantage in the future if the mortgage servicing operation were to continue to grow 
during growth in loans serviced for third parties was partially offset by sales of bank owned servicing  so that the amount of loans serviced by midwest rose by approximately during the year 
if midwest loan services adds additional subservicing customers in the future  the company intends to continue to pursue this strategy of selling company owned servicing rights so that its subservicing operation is not dependent upon company owned mortgage servicing rights to maintain a critical mass and economies of scale 
however  at year end  just  loans serviced by midwest loan services were serviced for the bank or midwest loan services own account 
since the bank acquired midwest loan services  the annual compound growth in mortgages subserviced for others has been

the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and statistical information presented elsewhere in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements which reflects the company s expectation or belief containing future events that involve risks and uncertainties 
among others  certain forward looking statements relate to the continued growth of various aspects of the company s community banking  mortgage banking and money management operations and the nature and adequacy of allowances for loan losses 
the company can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in its forward looking statements will prove to be correct 
various factors could cause results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
without intending to be exhaustive  these factors include reliance on key personnel and the potential inability of the company to attract or retain qualified managers  the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  including substantial operating losses  associated with the establishment and growth of the bank s ann arbor branch  without any assurance of future profitability  significant competition from other financial institutions with far greater assets and resources than the company  credit and loan loss risks associated with the relative lack of geographic diversity of the bank s borrowers who tend to be concentrated in the ann arbor  michigan area  the sensitivity of the company s operations to many factors beyond its control  including general economic conditions and monetary policies  and the effects of extensive governmental regulation and supervision  including risks that regulatory examiners give negative examination ratings 
the above cautionary statement is for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of general the discussion below must be considered in light of the fundamental changes resulting from the opening in february of a new main office of the bank in ann arbor  and the closing on december  of the sale by the bank of assets pertaining to its newberry  michigan headquarters office and its two branches in sault ste 
marie  michigan  which included the sale of deposits and loan portfolios the branch sale 
accordingly  historical results of operations of the commercial banking division are not indicative of future operations 
in addition  results of operations for   and  were significantly affected by the opening in february of the bank s office in ann arbor 
the operations of the company and the banking industry in general are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve board frb  the michigan state financial institutions bureau fib  and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by interest rates in competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for loan borrowing  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the economy and the availability of funds 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets of the company at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  loans receivable  net of reserves  increased by million to million from million 
cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold on an overnight basis at the end of decreased by million from the prior year  while securities decreased by million 
loans held for sale in the bank s mortgage banking division decreased by million from million to million 
during the second half of  management of the bank pursued a policy of decreasing reliance on certain high cost deposits and borrowings  reducing low yielding assets such as federal funds sold and increasing the rate at which loans held for sale were sold to improve profitability 
this reduced total assets  loans held for sale  federal funds sold  fhlb borrowings  and deposits

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars with the exception of the bidco  which uses the investment company method of accounting  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in the current interest rate environment  where there are rapid increases and decreases of interest rates  liquidity and the maturity structure of the bank s assets and liabilities are crucial determinants of the bank s profitability 
asset liability management all financial institutions are significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
the principal exposure of a financial institution s earnings to interest rate risk is the difference in time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest earning assets compared to the time between interest rate adjustments or maturities on interest bearing liabilities 
such difference is commonly referred to as a financial institution s gap position 
in periods when interest rates are increasing  a positive gap position will result in generally higher earnings as short term assets are repricing upward faster than longer term liabilities 
however during a declining rate environment  the opposite effect on earnings is true  with earnings being reduced due to short term assets repricing downward faster than longer term liabilities 
the following table presents the bank s interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the table is based upon various assumptions of management which may not necessarily reflect future experience

summary of results of operations the net loss from operations of the company was  in   in and  in earnings loss per share for  and were  and  respectively 
the increased loss in versus was principally due to increased losses at the bank s new ann arbor main office 
during the year fixed costs were higher than revenues  and although certain aspects of underlying operating results including key indicators such as net interest income improved  the break even point was only reached from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter 
a change in management at the bank also led to high severance and other expenses in the fourth quarter 
the bank s mortgage banking and other specialized financial subsidiaries had total increased profits of  in  a return on average investment and offset a portion of the losses from the community bank operations 
the increased loss in versus was principally due to start up losses of the bank s new ann arbor main office 
was a year where the bank grew its deposits in ann arbor from zero to a market share of 
ann arbor originated loans also grew  with an increase in porfolio loans of million 
although certain aspects of underlying operating results including key indicators such as net interest income improved each quarter  the main office s fixed costs were higher than available revenue 
the bank s mortgage banking and other specialized financial subsidiaries were substantially more profitable in than and offset a portion of the losses from the community bank operations 
was primarily a transition year following the sale in december of the bank s former main office in newberry and two branch offices in sault ste 
marie  including deposits and associated loan portfolios the branch sale 
during plans were laid to establish a new main office of the bank in ann arbor and to expand the bank s mortgage banking activities 
expenses associated with these initiatives and other unusual expenses decreased income in also  the bank sold most of its core loan portfolio in december  and a decrease in average earning assets together with the resulting decrease in net interest income as a percent of earning assets depressed the income of the bank in recent events the company approved and declared a partial stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend  by distributing to the holders of record at pm central standard time  on february   shares of common stock of the company  par value per share  at a rate of shares for each share of common stock issued and outstanding on such record date 
such distribution had the equivalent effect on the outstanding common stock as would a for stock split 
whole shares of common stock were distributed in lieu of any resulting fractional shares 
the stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend  as described above  was approved in order to comply with one of the new requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq small cap stock market  specifically the requirement that a listed company have at shares not held directly or indirectly by an officer or director of the issuer or any other person who is the beneficial owner of more than percent of the total shares outstanding 
towards the end of  the management of the company determined that the future success of the bank was dependent upon firm management response to regulatory criticism of past performance of the bank with respect to earnings and compliance  and the fact that the bank did not meet its internal budgetary goals for since mid november  a variety of measures have been taken by the company s ceo acting as the bank s new president  including replacing senior management at the bank  replacing the bank s board of directors  cutting employment levels at the bank approximately  reducing substandard loans via an aggressive collection effort by over  outsourcing the internal audit function to an independent cpa firm under the direction of the bank s internal audit coordinator  and hiring an experienced compliance officer who is also an attorney to ensure ongoing quality results 
as a result  the company and the bank reported an unaudited profit in both january and february net interest income net interest income represents the dollar amount by which interest income generated by interest earning assets exceeds the cost of funds 
interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  and the principal cost of funds is the interest paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings 
net interest income is affected by i the difference between the average rate of interest earned on the bank s interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and ii the relative amounts of its average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in order to maintain and increase earnings during periods of fluctuating interest rates  it is imperative that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities be managed effectively 
trends in net interest income provide a measure of the effectiveness by which a financial institution manages its interest rate sensitivity 
in each period  net interest income on a consolidated basis was reduced by interest expense associated with the holding company s bank loan indebtedness 
such interest expense was million in  million in and million in in the following table  non accrual loans are included in the average balances

provision for loan losses the bank charges to operations a provision for possible loan losses which is intended to create an allowance for future loan losses 
each year s provision reflects management s analysis of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for possible loan losses at a level adequate to absorb anticipated losses 
in its evaluation  management considers such factors as historical loan loss experience  specifically identified problem loans  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
a loan is charged off by management as a loss when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur 
non performing loans are defined as loans which have been placed on non accrual status and loans over days past due as to principal or interest and still in an accrual status 
where serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the accrual of interest is discontinued 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impaired and past due loans 
non performing loans amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in non performing loans during is the result of an increase in delinquent single family loans associated with the repurchase of loans from the bank s portfolio of residential mortgage servicing rights 
approximately  of the non performing commercial loans at december  were paid in full with no loss  subsequent to year end

with the opening of the bank s new ann arbor operation  management increased the monthly loan loss provision to a rate of  in february from in the prior year period 
in september  management accrued a special increase of  in the loan loss provision and increased the monthly rate beginning in october to  per month 
the special increase and the increase in the monthly rate was the result of a specific charge off of  on one upper peninsula commercial loan  which had a targeted reserve of  at december   combined with management s desire to build reserves at a faster rate  as new loan activity in ann arbor exceeded original management projections 
at year end  management added another  to the reserve based upon its analysis of the growth of the loan portfolio 
a special loan loss provision of  was charged to income in june as directed by the bank s regulatory examiners 
they required the special provision as a result of ratio analysis rather than specific loan problems  expected loan losses or actual loss experience 
using the same methodology as at june  an additional provision of  was added in december based upon management s analysis based on all available data at that time 
subsequent to year end several substandard commercial loans were paid in full  which would tend to increase the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
the historic and current levels of the reserve have been set at a level which management believes will be sufficient to maintain the overall allowance at an appropriate amount 
at year end  such ratio was  or  management believes that the ratio reflects a relatively conservative allowance level compared to expected future experience of the bank s loan portfolio based upon currently available facts 
with few exceptions  the bank no longer has loans to commercial borrowers located in the eastern upper peninsula of michigan  and the remaining loans generally appear to be well secured 
the bank s overall loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in ann arbor and the future performance of these loans is dependent upon the performance of relatively limited geographical areas 
based upon current economic conditions in the ann arbor and eastern upper peninsula market area  management currently anticipates that net loan losses in will not exceed  while the bank has just begun lending in the ann arbor area  and the local economy is among the fastest growing in the state of michigan  management needs to complete another full year to create a historical basis upon which to predict credit losses from this new lending activity 
management believes that the current reserve level is adequate to absorb future losses inherent in the loan portfolio  although the ultimate adequacy of the reserve is dependent upon future economic factors beyond the company s control 
a downturn in the general nationwide economy will tend to aggravate  for example  the problems of local loan customers currently facing some difficulties 
a general nationwide business expansion could conversely tend to diminish the severity of any such difficulties

based on recent comparable sales and indications of market value from industry brokers  management believes that the current market value of the bank s portfolio of mortgage servicing rights exceeds cost
