competition and restructuring electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
legislative authority has existed since that would permit vermont cities  towns and villages to own and operate public utilities 
since that time  no municipality served by the company has established or  as far as is known to the company  is presently taking steps to establish  a municipal public utility 
in  the vermont general assembly enacted legislation that authorized the department to sell electricity on a significantly expanded basis 
before the new law was passed  the department s authority to make retail sales had been limited 
it could sell at retail only to residential and farm customers and could sell only power that it had purchased from the niagara and st 
lawrence projects operated by the new york power authority 
under the law  the department can sell electricity purchased from any source at retail to all customer classes throughout the state  but only if it convinces the vpsb and other state officials that the public good will be served by such sales 
the department has made limited additional retail sales of electricity 
the department retains its traditional responsibilities of public advocacy before the vpsb  and electricity planning on a statewide basis 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and among states across the country  including vermont  are considering how to restructure the electric industry to facilitate competition for electricity sales at wholesale and retail levels

vermont yankee 
the company and central vermont public service corporation acted as lead sponsors in the construction of the vermont yankee nuclear plant  a boiling water reactor designed by general electric company 
the plant  which became operational in  has a generating capacity of mw 
vermont yankee has entered into power contracts with its sponsor utilities  including the company  that expire at the end of the life of the unit 
pursuant to its power contract  the company is required to pay of vermont yankee s operating expenses including depreciation and taxes  fuel costs including charges in respect of estimated costs of disposal of spent nuclear fuel  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity  whether or not the vermont yankee plant is operating 
in  the company sold to other vermont utilities a share of its entitlement to the output of vermont yankee 
accordingly  those utilities had an obligation to the company to pay of vermont yankee s operating expenses  fuel costs  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity 
as a result of the bankruptcy of one of those utilities  a portion of the entitlement has reverted back to the company 
accordingly  those utilities have an obligation to the company to pay of vermont yankee s operating expenses  fuel costs  decommissioning expenses  interest expense and return on common equity 
vermont yankee has also entered into capital funds agreements with its sponsor utilities that expire on december  under its capital funds agreement  the company is required  subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  to provide of the capital requirements of vermont yankee not obtained from outside sources 
on april   vermont yankee applied to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for an amendment to its operating license to extend the expiration date from december to march  in order to take advantage of current nrc policy to issue operating licenses for a year term measured from the grant of the operating license 
prior nrc policy  under which the operating license was issued  called for a term of years from the date of the construction permit 
on august   the state  opposing the license extension  filed a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene  which petition was subsequently granted 
on december   the nrc issued an amendment to the operating license extending the expiration date to march   based upon a no significant hazards finding by the nrc staff and subject to the outcome of the evidentiary hearing on the state s assertions 
on july   vermont yankee reached a settlement with the state  and the state filed a withdrawal of its intervention 
the proceeding was dismissed on september  in new england  five nuclear units are currently under orders from the nrc not to operate until shown to be in compliance with applicable safety provisions 
in december and august  decisions were made to retire two new england nuclear units  connecticut yankee and maine yankee  effective immediately  with several years remaining on each license 
the nrc s most recently issued vermont yankee s systematic assessment of licensee performance scores are for the period july  to january  operations  engineering and maintenance were rated good  while plant support was rated superior 
these scores are identical to vermont yankee s scores for the prior month period 
during periods when vermont yankee is unavailable  the company incurs replacement power costs in excess of those costs that the company would have incurred for power purchased from vermont yankee 
replacement power is available to the company from nepool and through special contractual arrangements with other utilities 
replacement power costs adversely affect cash flow and  absent deferral  amortization and recovery through rates  would adversely affect reported earnings 
routinely  in the case of scheduled outages for refueling  the vpsb has permitted the company to defer  amortize and recover these excess replacement power costs for financial reporting and ratemaking purposes over the period until the next scheduled outage 
vermont yankee has adopted an month refueling schedule 
on march   vermont yankee began a scheduled refueling outage 
in the case of unscheduled outages of significant duration resulting in substantial unanticipated costs for replacement power  the vpsb generally has authorized deferral  amortization and recovery of such costs 
vermont yankee s current estimate of decommissioning as approved by ferc is approximately  of which  has been funded 
at december   the company s portion of the net unfunded liability was  which it expects will be recovered through rates over vermont yankee s remaining operating life 
during  the company incurred  in vermont yankee annual capacity charges  which included  for interest charges 
the company s share of vermont yankee s long term debt at december  was  during the year ended december   the company utilized  mwh of vermont yankee energy to meet of its retail and requirements wholesale rate w sales 
the average cost of vermont yankee electricity in was cents per kwh 
in  vermont yankee had an annual capacity factor of  compared to in and in insurance the price anderson act currently limits public liability from a single incident at a nuclear power plant to billion 
any liability beyond billion are indemnified under an agreement with the nrc  but subject to congressional approval 
the first million of liability coverage is the maximum provided by private insurance 
the secondary financial protection program is a retrospective insurance plan providing additional coverage up to billion per incident by assessing premiums of million against each of the reactor units in the united states that are currently subject to the progam  limited to a maximum assessment of million per incident per nuclear unit in any one year 
the maximum assessment is expected to be adjusted at least every five years to reflect inflationary changes 
the above insurance now covers all workers employed at nuclear facilities for bodily injury claims 
vermont yankee had previously purchased a master worker insurance policy with limits of million with one automatic reinstatement of policy limits to cover workers employed on or after january  vermont yankee no longer participates in this retrospectively based worker policy and has replaced this policy with the guaranteed cost coverage mentioned above 
vermont yankee does  however  retain a potential obligation for retrospective adjustments due to past operations of several smaller facilities that did not join the new program 
these exposures will cease to exist no later than december  vermont yankee s maximum restrospective obligation remains at million 
the secondary financial protection layer  as referenced above  would be in excess of the master worker policy 
insurance has been purchased from nuclear electric insurance limited neil to cover the costs of property damage  decontanmination or premature decommissioning resulting from a nuclear incident 
all companies insured with neil are subject to retroactive assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available 
the maximum potential assessment against vermont yankee with respect to neil losses arising during the current policy year is million 
vermont yankee s liability for the retrospective premium adjustment for any policy year ceases six years after the end of that policy year unless prior demand has been made 
hydro quebec highgate interconnection 
on september   the highgate transmission facilities  which were constructed to import energy from hydro quebec in canada  began commercial operation 
the transmission facilities at highgate include a mw ac to dc to ac converter terminal and seven miles of kv transmission line 
velco built and operates the converter facilities  which are jointly owned by a number of vermont utilities  including the company 
nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
velco and certain other nepool members have entered into agreements with hydro quebec providing for the construction in two phases of a direct interconnection between the electric systems in new england and the electric system of hydro quebec in canada 
the vermont participants in this project  which has a capacity of  mw  will derive about of the total power supply benefits associated with the nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
the company  in turn  receives about one third of the vermont share of those benefits 
the benefits of the interconnection include access to surplus hydroelectric energy from hydro quebec at a cost below that of the replacement cost of power and energy otherwise available to the new england participants  energy banking  under which participating new england utilities will transmit relatively inexpensive energy to hydro quebec during off peak periods and will receive equal amounts of energy  after adjustment for transmission losses  from hydro quebec during peak periods when replacement costs are higher  and provision for emergency transfers and mutual backup to improve reliability for both the hydro quebec system and the new england systems 
phase i 
the first phase phase i of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection consists of transmission facilities having a capacity of mw that traverse a portion of eastern vermont and extend to a converter terminal located in comerford  new hampshire 
these facilities entered commercial operation on october  vetco was organized to construct  own and operate those portions of the transmission facilities located in vermont 
total construction costs incurred by vetco for phase i were  of that amount  velco provided  of equity capital to vetco through sales of velco preferred stock to the vermont participants in the project 
the company purchased  of velco preferred stock to finance the equity portion of phase i 
the remaining  of construction cost was financed by vetco s issuance of  of long term debt in the fourth quarter of and the balance of  was financed by short term debt 
under the phase i contracts  each new england participant  including the company  is required to pay monthly its proportionate share of vetco s total cost of service  including its capital costs  as well as a proportionate share of the total costs of service associated with those portions of the transmission facilities constructed in new hampshire by a subsidiary of new england electric system 
phase ii 
agreements executed in among the company  velco and other nepool members and hydro quebec provided for the construction of the second phase phase ii of the interconnection between the new england electric system and that of hydro quebec 
phase ii expands the phase i facilities from mw to  mw  and provides for transmission of hydro quebec power from the phase i terminal in northern new hampshire to sandy pond  massachusetts 
construction of phase ii commenced in and was completed in late the phase ii facilities commenced commercial operation november   initially at a rating of  mw  and increased to a transfer capability of  mw in july the hydro quebec nepool firm energy contract provides for the import of economical hydro quebec energy into new england 
the company is entitled to of the phase ii power supply benefits 
total construction costs for phase ii were approximately  the new england participants  including the company  have contracted to pay monthly their proportionate share of the total cost of constructing  owning and operating the phase ii facilities  including capital costs 
as a supporting participant  the company must make support payments under year agreements 
these support agreements meet the capital lease accounting requirements under sfas at december   the present value of the company s obligation was  the company s projected future minimum payments under the phase ii support agreements are  for each of the years and an aggregate of  for the years the phase ii portion of the project is owned by new england hydro transmission electric company  inc and new england hydro transmission corporation  subsidiaries of new england electric system  in which certain of the phase ii participating utilities  including the company  own equity interests 
the company owns approximately of the equity of the corporations owning the phase ii facilities 
during construction of the phase ii project  the company  as an equity sponsor  was required to provide equity capital 
at december   the capital structure of such corporations was common equity and long term debt 
see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at times  the company requests that portions of its power deliveries from hydro quebec and other sources be routed through new york 
the company s ability to do so could be adversely affected by the proposed tariff that nepool has filed with the ferc 
a reduction of the company s allocation of capacity on transmission interfaces with new york could adversely affect the company s ability to import power to vermont from outside new england which would impact the company s power costs in the future

small power production 
the vpsb has adopted rules that implement for vermont the purchase requirements established by federal law in the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
under the rules  qualifying facilities have the option to sell their output to a central state purchasing agent under a variety of long and short term  firm and non firm pricing schedules  each of which is based upon the projected vermont composite system s power costs which would be required but for the purchases from small producers 
the state purchasing agent assigns the energy so purchased  and the costs of purchase  to each vermont retail electric utility based upon its pro rata share of total vermont retail energy sales 
utilities may also contract directly with producers 
the rules provide that all reasonable costs incurred by a utility under the rules will be included in the utilities revenue requirements for ratemaking purposes 
currently  the state purchasing agent  vermont electric power producers  inc veppi  is authorized to seek mw of power from qualifying facilities under purpa  of which the company s current pro rata share would be approximately or mw 
the rated capacity of the qualifying facilities currently selling power to veppi is approximately mw 
these facilities were all online by the spring of  and no other projects are under development 
the company does not expect any new projects to come online in the foreseeable future because the excess capacity in the region has eliminated the need for and value of additional qualifying facilities 
in  the company  through both its direct contracts and veppi  purchased  mwh of qualifying facilities production to meet of its retail and requirements wholesale sales at an average cost of cents per kwh 
short term opportunity purchases and sales 
the company has made arrangements with several utilities in new england and new york under which the company may make purchases or sales of utility system power on short notice and generally for brief periods of time when it appears economic to do so 
opportunity purchases are arranged when it is possible to purchase power from another utility for less than it would cost the company to generate the power with its own sources 
purchases also help the company save on replacement power costs during an outage of one of its base load sources 
opportunity sales are arranged when the company has surplus energy available at a price that is economic to other regional utilities at any given time 
the sales are arranged based on forecasted costs of supplying the incremental power necessary to serve the sale 
prices are set so as to recover all of the forecasted fuel or production costs and to recover some if not all associated capacity costs 
during  the company purchased  mwh  meeting of the company s retail and requirements wholesale sales  at an average cost of cents per kwh

during  the company s retail and requirements wholesale sales were provided by the following fuel sources from hydro company owned  nypa  hydro quebec and small power producers  from nuclear  from coal  from wood  from natural gas  from oil  and from wind 
the remaining was purchased on a short term basis from other utilities and through nepool 
vermont yankee has approximately  of requirements based purchase contracts for nuclear fuel needs to meet substantially all of its power production requirements through under these contracts  any disruption of operating activity would allow vermont yankee to cancel or postpone deliveries until actually needed 
vermont yankee has a contract with the united states department of energy doe for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
under the terms of this contract  in exchange for the one time fee discussed below and a quarterly fee of mil per kwh of electricity generated and sold  the doe agrees to provide disposal services when a facility for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste is available  which is required by contract to be prior to january  the actual date for these disposal services is expected to be delayed many years 
the doe contract obligates vermont yankee to pay a one time fee of approximately  for disposal costs for all spent fuel discharged through april  although such amount has been collected in rates from the vermont yankee participants  vermont yankee has elected to defer payment of the fee to the doe as permitted by the doe contract 
the fee must be paid no later than the first delivery of spent nuclear fuel to the doe 
interest accrues on the unpaid obligation based on the thirteen week treasury bill rate and is compounded quarterly 
through  vermont yankee accumulated approximately  in an irrevocable trust to be used exclusively for defeasing this obligation at some future date  provided the doe complies with the terms of the aforementioned contract 
the company does not maintain long term contracts for the supply of oil for the oil fired peaking unit generating stations wholly owned by it mw 
the company did not experience difficulty in obtaining oil for its own units during  and  while no assurance can be given  does not anticipate any such difficulty during none of the utilities from which the company expects to purchase oil or gas fired capacity in has advised the company of grounds for doubt about maintenance of secure sources of oil and gas during the year 
coal for merrimack is presently being purchased under a long term contract from balley mine in western pennsylvania and occasionally on the spot market from northern west virginia and southern pennsylvania sources 
wood for the mcneil plant is furnished to the burlington electric department from a variety of sources under short term contracts ranging from several weeks to six months duration 
the mcneil plant used  tons of wood chips and mill residue and  cubic feet of gas in the mcneil plant is forecasting consumption of wood chips for to be  tons and gas consumption of  cubic feet 
the stony brook combined cycle generating station is capable of burning either natural gas or oil in two of its turbines 
natural gas is supplied to the plant subject to its availability 
during periods of extremely cold weather  the supplier reserves the right to discontinue deliveries to the plant in order to satisfy the demand of its residential customers 
the company assumes for planning and budgeting purposes that the plant will be supplied with gas during the months of april through november  and that it will run solely on oil during the months of december through march 
the plant maintains an oil supply sufficient to meet approximately one half of its annual needs 
wind project 
the company s years of research and development work in wind generation was recognized in when the company was selected by the doe and the electric power research institute epri to build a commercial scale wind powered facility 
the company was awarded  by the doe and epri to provide partial funding for the wind project 
the overall cost of the project  located in the southern vermont town of searsburg  is estimated to be  the eleven wind turbines have a rating of mw and were commissioned july  the company is a utility leader in wind power research 
the company s extensive wind resource database shows that wind power is technically feasible and is becoming economically viable at other sites within vermont 
several years of wind turbine operation at mt 
equinox  vermont  has provided the company with valuable knowledge about the effects of icing and extreme cold on the performance of wind turbines  and the necessary adaptations for these conditions 
the searsburg wind project affords an opportunity to employ turbines that are of an advanced design and larger scale than the mt 
equinox turbines 
the economies of scale and advanced technology inherent in these turbines offer a more competitive and reliable source of power than earlier designs 
first hand knowledge about these turbines in vermont s climatic conditions will enable the company to make intelligent and timely decisions about this power resource  which can be installed in increments that closely match the need for power 
furthermore  the project s size and northerly location will boost the commercialization of wind power by deploying a new model of turbines in sufficient quantities to obtain statistically valid operations and maintenance data  which will be shared with other utilities 
finally  information related to the siting  permitting  and possible impacts on the natural environment will also be documented and shared with the industry and the public 
the company estimates that the wind project will cause rates to rise less than one half of in the first several years of the project 
early in the next century  however  the company projects that electricity from wind energy will cost less than comparable power from other sources 
over the life of the project  the average cost of electricity from the wind farm  which provides electricity at times of peak demand for the company  is expected to be competitive with the cost of alternatives in the market

energy efficiency in  the company continued to focus its energy efficiency services on lost opportunity programs which encouraged customers to install energy efficient equipment when they are planning to replace or buy new equipment 
this strategy  along with careful management  has helped the company to further reduce its cost per kilowatthour saved by below its costs in the current cost of saving per kilowatthour is approximately cents which is a reduction in costs since in  the company s energy efficiency programs saved  mwh  above targeted savings for the year 
during the past five years  the company s efficiency programs have achieved a cumulative savings of  megawatthours 
in  the company worked with other vermont utilities and the department to develop a set of statewide energy efficiency programs 
this effort should reduce the cost of delivering these programs and provide a more standardized service to customers throughout the state 
in  the company spent approximately  on energy efficiency programs  approximately of retail revenue 
rate design 
the company seeks to design rates to encourage the shifting of electrical use from peak hours to off peak hours 
since  the company has offered optional time of use rates for residential and commercial customers 
currently  approximately  of the company s residential customers continue to be billed on the original time of use rate basis 
in  the company received regulatory approval for a rate design that permitted it to charge prices for electric service that reflected as accurately as possible the cost burden imposed by each customer class 
the company s rate design objectives are to provide a stable pricing structure and to accurately reflect the cost of providing electric services 
this rate structure helps to achieve these goals 
since inefficient use of electricity increases its cost  customers who are charged prices that reflect the cost of providing electrical service have real incentives to follow the most efficient usage patterns 
included in the vpsb s order approving this rate design was a requirement that the company s largest customers be charged time of use rates on a phased in basis by at year end december   approximately  of the company s largest customers  comprising of retail revenues  continue to receive service on mandatory time of use rates 
in may  the company filed its current rate design with the vpsb 
the parties  including the department  ibm and a low income advocacy group  entered into a settlement that was approved by the vpsb on december  under the settlement  the revenue allocation to each rate class was adjusted to reflect class by class cost changes since  the differential between the winter and summer rates was reduced  the customer charge was increased for most classes  and usage charges were adjusted to be closer to the associated marginal costs 
no rate redesign has taken place since the vpsb order issued on december  dispatchable and interruptible service contracts 
in  the company had interruptible dispatchable power contracts with three major ski areas  interruptible only contracts with five customers and dispatchable only contracts with an additional twenty four customers 
the interruptible portion of the contracts allow the company to control power supply capacity charges by reducing the company s capacity requirements 
during  the company did not request any interruptions due to the surplus capacity in the region 
the dispatchable portion of the contracts allows customers to purchase electricity during times designated by the company when low cost power is available 
the customer s demand during these periods is not considered in calculating the monthly billing 
this program enables the company and the customers to benefit from load control 
the company shifts load from its high cost peak periods while the customer uses inexpensive power at a time when its use provides maximum value 
these programs are available by tariff for qualifying customers 
construction and capital requirements the company s capital expenditures for through and projection for are set forth in item md a liquidity and capital resources construction 
construction projections are subject to continuing review and may be revised from time to time in accordance with changes in the company s financial condition  load forecasts  the availability and cost of labor and materials  licensing and other regulatory requirements  changing environmental standards and other relevant factors

earnings summary earnings per average share of common stock in were as compared with in and in the earnings represent an earned return on average common equity of percent 
the earned return on average common equity in was percent and percent in the decrease in earnings was primarily due to diminished results by two of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
mountain energy  inc  the company s subsidiary that has invested in energy generation and energy and wastewater efficiency projects  earned million less in than in  primarily due to operating losses incurred by micronair  llc  a company in which mountain energy acquired a percent interest in  and a decline in rates paid for power generated by one of the california wind facilities in which it has invested 
green mountain resources inc s gmri loss in was million greater than the loss in due primarily to the development costs of its investment in green mountain energy resources llc gmer  the retail energy company in which the company sold a percent interest to an affiliate of the sam wyly family during the third quarter of subsequently  the wyly family affiliate invested an additional million in gmer  increasing its ownership percentage to percent 
the decrease in earnings was primarily due to increased mandatory purchases of power from independent power producers resulting from greater production from in state hydroelectric plants and unusually warm weather in december that adversely affected the company s electric operating revenues and sales of propane by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  green mountain propane gas company 
future outlook competition and restructuring the electric utility business is being subjected to rapidly increasing competitive pressures stemming from a combination of trends  including the presence of surplus generating capacity  a disparity in electric rates among and within various regions of the country  improvements in generation efficiency  increasing demand for customer choice  and new regulations and legislation intended to foster competition 
to date  this competition has been most prominent in the bulk power market  in which non utility generators have significantly increased their market share 
electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
as a result  competition for retail customers has been limited to i competition with alternative fuel suppliers  primarily for heating and cooling  ii competition with customer owned generation  and iii direct competition among electric utilities to attract major new facilities to their service territories 
these competitive pressures have led the company and other utilities to offer  from time to time  special discounts or service packages to certain large customers 
in states across the country  including the new england states  there has been an increasing number of proposals to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems also known as retail wheeling 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices high enough to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and among states across the country  including vermont  are considering how to facilitate competition for electricity sales at the wholesale and retail levels 
on october   the vermont public service board vpsb and the vermont department of public service the department convened a roundtable on competition and the electric industry  consisting of representatives of affected parties 
on july   a subgroup of the roundtable agreed on a set of principles intended to guide the debate in vermont concerning competition 
these principles  among other things  call for exploration of the potential for retail competition  honoring of past utility commitments incurred under regulation  protection for low income customers  and continued exploration of renewable resources  energy efficiency and environmental protections 
on september   governor dean of vermont announced his desire to provide for competition and a restructuring of the electric utility industry 
the governor s announcement included proposed legislative adoption of restructuring principles  a vpsb proceeding to address the issue  the submission by vermont electric utilities of detailed plans by may   and implementation of restructuring by the beginning of in response to a department petition  the vpsb opened a proceeding on utility industry restructuring by order dated october  on december   the company released its proposed restructuring plan  calling for corporate separation into a regulated company for transmission and distribution functions and an unregulated company for generation and sales functions 
on october   the vpsb issued a draft report and order which proposed the commencement of competitive retail sales of electricity in early  while distribution and transmission functions would remain subject to regulation 
the company and other parties responded to the draft report and order in november  and the vpsb issued its final report and order on december  final report 
the final report indicated that vermont investor owned utilities may be required to divide their competitive retail and regulated distribution and transmission functions into separate corporate subsidiaries in order to achieve a functional separation of regulated and unregulated businesses  and envisioned competition for all customer classes to be completed by the end of in view of this potential change in structure as well as the unknown relative level of competition each corporation may face  the company cannot predict the future cost or availability of capital for the new subsidiary corporations  except to the extent that it has already created a functionally separate retail marketing affiliate  gmer 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unregulated businesses green mountain resources  inc furthermore  most of the assets of the company are encumbered by a lien of the company s first mortgage indenture 
the company cannot predict with certainty at this time the cost and feasibility of obtaining approval from the existing bondholders  to the extent that it is determined that such approvals are necessary  in order to achieve functional separation 
the final report proposed an approach that takes into account multiple factors that the vpsb believes will create the opportunity for full recovery of stranded costs provided they are legitimate  verifiable  otherwise recoverable  prudently incurred and non mitigable  but the final report also stated the vpsb s belief that an opportunity for full recovery must be explicitly tied to successful mitigation 
the final report further provided that  where a utility has successfully mitigated its stranded costs  the opportunity should exist for substantial or full recovery of stranded costs when the magnitude of the post mitigation stranded costs  among other things  allows for rates that are comparable to regional rates 
the final report proposed that allowed stranded cost recovery be accomplished through the use of a non bypassable access charge  or competitive transition charge ctc  collected by the regulated distribution company 
the final report also endorsed the securitization of stranded costs through the assignment of ctc receipts as a means of achieving lower cost financing and supported legislative action to achieve these savings 
in early  the company  central vermont public service corporation cvps  representatives of the governor of vermont and the department negotiated a memorandum of understanding mou that outlined agreed upon positions among the parties relative to the recovery of stranded costs  distribution company rates  corporate unbundling and societal benefit programs 
in early april  the vermont senate passed senate bill no 
s 
 an electric utility restructuring bill  which requires passage by the vermont house of representatives and signature by the governor before becoming law 
this bill was opposed by the company and other utilities in vermont in the legislative session that ended in june s 
establishes several goals  including the conflicting objectives that stranded costs be shared equally between utilities and customers and that the continuing financial integrity of the utility be preserved 
under s 
 full retail competition in vermont would have started in october and the vpsb was given considerable discretion to weigh various potentially conflicting objectives  including the two objectives set forth above  in deciding the extent to which and manner under which a utility can recover stranded costs 
s 
also provides that utilities must either divest unregulated enterprises or functionally separate them from regulated business activities  an incentive for the early closing and decommissioning of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant  that any retail electricity provider in vermont shall have ownership of sufficient tradable renewable energy credits as defined in s 
 that the vpsb may order performance based regulation for distribution functions if it finds that departure from cost of service regulation is in the public interest  for the provision of out placement service and severance pay for utility employees adversely affected by restructuring  with such costs shared equally by the utility and its customers  and that if a utility has received some above market cost recovery and then the utility is acquired  the vpsb is to determine how much  if at all  the value of the acquired company was enhanced by the recovery of above market costs and thereafter determine how the enhanced value should be shared equitably between the acquired utility s shareholders and customers 
the company has strenuously opposed the enactment of s 
into law principally because its stranded cost sharing provisions would jeopardize the company s financial viability 
the ability of the company to apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effect of rate regulation and record regulatory assets and liabilities would be significantly challenged by the proposed enactment of s 
in the event that the criteria for applying statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas are no longer met  the company would be required to write off a material amount of its regulatory assets 
more significantly  the company would be required to record its best estimate of the loss resulting from the equal sharing between the company and its customers of the portion of stranded costs represented by above market purchase power obligations 
these obligations result from contracts for power entered into by the company to meet its obligation to serve its retail customers 
such losses could impact the company s credit rating  dividend policy and financial viability 
in mid april  the vermont house of representatives indicated through its speaker that there was insufficient time in the legislative session which ended in june to act upon a utility restructuring bill 
s 
was not considered by the vermont house of representatives in the legislative session 
however  along with other proposed bills  it is being considered by the house of representatives during the session 
on july   the speaker of the house named an eleven member non standing committee to consider reform of the vermont electric utility regulatory system 
in mid october  the chair of the committee reported that the committee did not recommend that the vermont legislature consider legislation during the session to allow customer choice at this time 
nevertheless  proposed electric utility related legislation  which the house has taken no action on  consists of the following h 
 which would create performance based regulation  but not provide for competitive retail sales of electricity  h 
 which would mirror most of the terms of the mou but would not provide reasonable stranded cost recovery for the company  and h 
 which also would mirror most of the terms of the mou but would confer jurisdiction on the vpsb to provide for stranded cost recovery as a ratemaking function 
there is no assurance that any restructuring legislation will be enacted by the vermont general assembly in its session that is scheduled to adjourn mid april or  if legislation is enacted  that it will be consistent with the terms of the final report 
the company has stated its position that if legislation is enacted that threatens the company s financial integrity  it will pursue all remedies available to it under law 
risk factors the major risk factors for the company arising from electric industry restructuring  including risks pertaining to the recovery of stranded costs  are i regulatory and legal decisions  ii the market price of power  and iii the amount of market share retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that a final restructuring plan ordered by the vpsb  the courts  or through legislation will include a ctc or other mechanism that would allow for full recovery of stranded costs and include a fair return on those costs as they are being recovered 
if laws are enacted or regulatory decisions are made that do not offer an adequate opportunity to recover stranded costs  the company believes it has compelling legal arguments to challenge such laws or decisions 
the largest category of the company s stranded costs are future costs under long term power purchase contracts 
the company intends to pursue compliance with the steps outlined in the final report and aggressively to pursue mitigation efforts in order to maximize its recovery of these costs 
the magnitude of stranded costs for the company is largely dependent upon the future market price of power 
the company has discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  have resulted in estimates of the company s stranded costs of between million and billion 
if retail competition is implemented in vermont  there will be an impact on the company s revenues from electricity sales 
however  the company is unable to predict at this time the extent of this impact 
gmer  the company s affiliate  is expected to participate in the residential and small commercial and industrial customer market in vermont at such time when restructuring occurs 
the company has agreed not to compete against gmer in the retail energy business for a period of seven years 
the company  itself or through another marketing affiliate  may elect to endeavor to retain and attract larger commercial customers in a competitive retail environment  but neither its relative prospects or the margins it will realize on any such sales can be estimated at this time 
historically  electric utility rates have been based on a utility s cost of service 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that are not applicable to other business enterprises in general 
sfas requires regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
as described in note a 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company complies with the provisions of sfas in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  non cash charge to operations of an amount that could be material 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include increasing competition that restricts the company s ability to charge prices to recover specific costs and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the provisions of the final report  if implemented  would meet the criteria for continuing application of sfas as to those costs for which recovery is permitted 
s 
 however  would not meet the criteria for the continuing application of sfas under sfas  accounting for contingencies  the enactment of s 
or other restructuring legislation or order containing comparable provisions on stranded cost recovery would also require the company to immediately estimate and record losses  on an undiscounted basis  for any discretionary above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are not probable of recovery from customers  to the extent that those costs are estimable 
the company is unable to predict what form enacted legislation will take  and it cannot predict if or to what extent sfas will continue to be applicable in the future 
members of the staff of the securities and exchange commission have raised questions concerning the continued applicability of sfas to certain other electric utilities facing restructuring 
on july   the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board indicated that utilities should immediately discontinue application of sfas for those business segments which will become unregulated  if the utility has a final plan in place for transition to competition 
to the extent that the discontinued segment has assets secured in arrangements such as a ctc  those assets would continue to be accounted for under sfas sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which was implemented by the company on january   requires that any assets  including regulatory assets  that are no longer probable of recovery through future revenues be revalued based upon future cash flows 
sfas requires that a rate regulated enterprise recognize an impairment loss for regulatory assets which are no longer probable of recovery 
as of december   based upon the regulatory environment within which the company currently operates  no impairment loss was incurred 
competitive influences or regulatory developments may impact this status in the future 
the company cannot predict whether restructuring legislation enacted by the vermont general assembly or any subsequent report or actions of  or proceedings before  the vpsb or the vermont general assembly would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  financial condition or credit ratings 
the company s failure to recover a significant portion of its purchased power costs  or to retain and attract customers in a competitive environment  would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including its operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at current levels 
for a discussion of a major risk factor arising from vermont regulatory treatment of the company s recent rate filing  see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
unregulated businesses the following is a discussion of the company s unregulated enterprises 
mountain energy  inc  which has invested in energy generation and energy and waste water efficiency projects  earned  in  compared to net income of million in the decrease in earnings was due primarily to start up operating losses incurred by micronair  llc 
and a decline in rates paid for power generated by one of its wind facilities in california 
the results contributed cents of earnings per share to the company s consolidated results as compared to cents in since its formation in  mountain energy has invested more than million in ten operating energy projects  including two california wind projects  hydroelectric projects in california and new hampshire  a gas cogeneration facility in illinois and energy efficiency installations in maine  new york  new jersey  massachusetts and hawaii 
in  mountain energy broadened its investment portfolio by acquiring an initial percent ownership interest in micronair  llc  which owns certain patent rights to a wastewater treatment system that provides an innovative and efficient solution to the biosolids disposal issues facing the united states 
the micronairr system enhances both the processing and energy efficiency at wastewater facilities  virtually eliminating biosolids as a byproduct 
mountain energy increased its ownership interest in micronair to percent at the end of green mountain propane gas company gmpg  which sells propane gas at retail in vermont and new hampshire  experienced a  loss in as compared to a  loss in the loss in was due primarily to a decrease in propane sales caused by warmer than normal weather in early in and  the losses incurred by gmpg reduced the company s consolidated earnings by cents and cents  respectively  per share of common stock 
on february   gmpg and the company entered into a sales agreement with vgs propane  llc for the sale of all gmpg assets 
the sale was completed on march  see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the loss in was due primarily to strong competition  low margins due to significant wholesale price fluctuations  increased producer pipeline restrictions beginning in november and warmer than normal weather in december the company s unregulated rental water heater business earned  in  a slight increase from s net income of  the and results contributed and cents of earnings  respectively  per share to the company s consolidated results 
green mountain resources  inc  which was formed in april to explore opportunities in competitive retail energy markets  experienced a loss of million in that was million greater than its loss of  in  due primarily to the development costs of its investment in gmer 
on august   the company and the sam wyly family announced that their affiliates will jointly own gmer  a delaware limited liability company of which gmri was the sole owner 
gmer is competing in the emerging consumer retail energy market starting in california where customers are able to choose their electricity supplier as of march  gmer has created retail brands of electricity and natural gas that will be sold to consumers who care about the environment in competitive markets across the nation 
an affiliate of the sam wyly family  green funding i  llc the investor  entered into an operating agreement with gmri governing the ownership of gmer 
pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement  the investor initially agreed to invest up to million in gmer in exchange for an equity interest of percent while gmri contributed certain assets and business development concepts in exchange for an equity interest of percent in gmer 
subsequently  the investor agreed to invest an additional million in gmer  increasing its ownership percentage to percent 
these ownership interests may be reduced further if gmer warrants and options issued to gmer management and consultants are exercised 
gmri s ownership percentage of gmer will be further diluted if the investor and or third parties contribute additional capital to gmer and gmri does not make pro rata additional capital contributions at such time 
gmri received a payment of million from gmer at the closing as reimbursement for certain development expenses incurred 
pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement  funds provided by the investor will be used to pay future gmer development expenses and operating costs 
gmri is not obligated to fund future development costs  and the operating agreement provides that gmri will not be allocated operating losses from gmer  thus limiting the company s shareholders future financial risk while preserving their opportunity to participate in the success of gmer 
in addition  the company and the investor have agreed that neither the company nor the investor will compete against gmer in the retail energy business for a period of seven years 
douglas g

 in  total electricity sales decreased percent due principally to a decrease in wholesale sales caused by a reduction in low margin  off system sales 
sales of electricity to residential customers was negatively impacted by winter temperatures in the first quarter of that were substantially warmer than normal 
total operating revenues were virtually unchanged in total retail revenues increased percent in primarily due to an increase in sales of electricity to the company s small commercial and industrial customers resulting from modest customer growth and an increase in sales to ibm 
the increase in retail revenues was nearly offset by a percent decrease in wholesale revenues caused by a reduction in low margin  off system sales  which had a minimal impact on earnings and a percent decrease in other operating revenues caused by a one time adjustment in to account for higher charges under a transmission and interconnection agreement between cvps and the company 
in  total electricity sales increased percent due principally to an increase in electricity consumption by the company s commercial and industrial customers and regional market conditions that allowed the company to buy electricity and to resell it to other utilities at prices slightly higher than the purchase price 
total operating revenues increased percent in primarily due to retail rate increases of percent and percent that went into effect in june and june  respectively  and the increase in electricity sales mentioned above 
total retail revenues increased percent in primarily due to the retail rate increases mentioned above 
wholesale revenues increased percent in primarily due to the regional market conditions mentioned above 
ibm  the company s single largest customer  operates manufacturing facilities in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its main plant and an adjacent plant accounted for  and percent of the company s operating revenues in  and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue 
in february  the company and ibm entered into an economic development agreement eda i that governed the prices to be paid by ibm at its essex junction facility for incremental electric usage during  and the contract  intended to promote growth in ibm s operations and create jobs in the company s service area  applied only to that portion of ibm s load that exceeded its consumption level 
most of ibm s electric usage is billed under the company s tariff rate 
the eda i price  although lower than the company s tariff rate  exceeded the company s marginal costs of providing this incremental electric service to ibm 
the vpsb approved the eda i in june prior to the expiration of the eda i on december   the company and ibm negotiated a new  similar eda eda ii 
the agreement has most of the features of the eda i  including use of the base to determine incremental load and pricing above the company s marginal costs 
a separate pricing provision applies to load above levels 
the company expects the vpsb to approve eda ii as presented in early the company believes that the eda i and eda ii benefit the company because the agreements encourage the incremental purchase of electricity by ibm at a price above the company s marginal cost of providing such incremental service 
power supply expenses power supply expenses constituted percent  percent and percent of total operating expenses for the years  and  respectively 
these expenses increased by  percent in and by million percent in total power supply expenses were slightly higher in  although the cost of several individual sources were significantly different from their costs in power supply expenses from vermont yankee increased percent in primarily due to the deferral in and the amortization in of costs associated with a scheduled refueling outage 
company owned generation expenses increased percent in primarily due to the increased usage of company owned plants necessitated by the outage of certain nuclear power plants in the region 
these increases were nearly offset by a percent decrease in power supply expenses from other resources primarily due to the recognition of million received from hydro quebec under a memorandum of understanding entered into in as described below consistent with a vpsb accounting order dated december  this accounting treatment was subsequently changed 
see below 
during  the company negotiated an arrangement with hydro quebec that reduces the cost impacts associated with the purchase of schedules b and c under the contract over the november through october period the july agreement 
under the july agreement  the company  in essence  will take delivery of the amounts of energy as specified in the contract  but the associated fixed costs will be significantly reduced from those specified in the contract 
as part of the july agreement  the company is obligated to purchase million in dollars worth of research and development work from hydro quebec over the four year period  and made a million in dollars cash payment to hydro quebec in hydro quebec retains the right to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in quebec 
under an arrangement negotiated in january  the company received cash payments from hydro quebec of million in and million in consistent with allowed ratemaking treatment  the million payment reduced purchase power expense by million in  the balance of the payment reduced power costs in the million payment reduces purchase power expense ratably over the period beginning june and ending may an order issued by the vpsb in march requires the company instead to amortize the million over a four year period 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the arrangement requires the company to shift up to megawatts of its schedule c deliveries to an alternate transmission path  and use the associated portion of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection facilities to purchase power for the period from september through june at prices that vary based upon conditions in effect when the purchases are made 
the arrangement also provides for minimum payments by the company to hydro quebec for periods in which power is not purchased under the arrangement 
although the level of benefits to the company will depend on various factors  the company estimates that the arrangement will provide a minimum benefit of million on a net present value basis 
under a separate agreement executed on december   hydro quebec provided a cash payment of million to the company in in return for this payment  the company is providing hydro quebec with the choice of selecting one of two alternatives by april   described below alternative a for the period commencing november  and effective through the remaining term of the contract  which expires in  hydro quebec can exercise an option to purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis  at energy prices established in accordance with the contract  for an amount of energy equivalent to the company s firm capacity entitlements in the contract 
the cumulative amount of energy purchased over the remaining term of the contract shall not exceed  mwh 
hydro quebec may not exercise its annual rights to purchase power in the amounts specified under an arrangement made in november during those years in which hydro quebec exercises its rights to curtail energy deliveries in accordance with the july agreement 
alternative b for the period commencing november  and effective through the remaining term of the contract  hydro quebec can exercise an option to purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis  at energy prices established in accordance with the contract  for an amount of energy equivalent to the company s firm capacity entitlements in the contract 
the cumulative amount of energy purchased over the remaining term of the contract shall not exceed  mwh 
unlike alternative a  hydro quebec s option to curtail energy deliveries pursuant to the july agreement can be exercised in addition to the purchase option under alternative b 
finally  for the period commencing january  and effective though the remaining term of the contract under alternative b  hydro quebec can exercise an option on an annual basis to purchase up to  mwh at the contract energy price 
hydro quebec can purchase no more than  mwh in any given year 
under modifications agreed to by hydro quebec and the company  hydro quebec has until april  to elect either alternative a or b

notwithstanding the december  accounting order  the vpsb ordered a change in accounting treatment in an order released on march  the company intends to appeal or request reconsideration of this decision 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
power supply expenses increased in primarily due to higher costs for power purchased from hydro quebec  increases in mandatory purchases from independent power producers and purchases of additional power to service increased electricity sales 
vermont yankee s operating expenses for exceeded the level of such expenses incurred during by approximately million  of which approximately  was allocated to the company 
in  vermont yankee elected to accelerate certain safety and management related projects intended to improve efficiency of the plant and assure compliance with nuclear regulatory commission regulations and the facility s operating license 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased percent in primarily due to an increase in work performed on behalf of gmri  effectively reducing payroll and overhead expenses for the company 
additionally  the organizational changes attributable to the creation of gmer resulted in fewer company employees  causing a reduction in payroll expense 
other operating expenses decreased percent in primarily due to a decrease in salaries resulting from a reduction in the workforce and to a decrease in medical insurance claims experienced by the company 
transmission expenses transmission expenses increased percent in primarily due to higher tariffs under a new operating agreement with new england power company 
transmission expenses increased percent in primarily due to higher tariff rates under a transmission and interconnection agreement between cvps and the company discussed below 
this increase was offset to a large extent by revenues generated by the same transmission and interconnection agreement 
in august  the company received a bill totaling approximately million from cvps for service at certain transmission interconnections that are the subject of a transmission and interconnection agreement between the company and cvps 
the bill covered the period october through june in september  the company charged approximately  of the cvps invoice to transmission rent expense and deferred the remaining charges 
the company paid the cvps billing but sought relief under the agreement s arbitration clause on the ground  among others  that substantial portions of the bill  inclusive of interest  were not properly chargeable under the agreement 
the company submitted a bill totaling approximately  to cvps for its services under the same transmission and interconnection agreement  and credited this amount to transmission services in september cvps disputed a portion of the amount billed by the company  but paid the bill 
on december   the company received an accounting order from the vpsb permitting amounts deferred under the transmission and interconnection agreement to be expensed over the remaining eleven years of the agreement subject to review in future rate cases 
in february  following arbitration  the company received  from cvps  in resolution of each of the parties claims under this agreement 
management sought to recover in rates by inclusion in ratebase the month average balance of the charges from cvps net of amounts recovered in prior rate orders of the costs of transmission under this agreement  revenues that the company received under the agreement for providing service to cvps  and the approximate amount of the arbitration award 
the amount sought in the rate case was approximately  management received ratemaking treatment for these costs in an order released by the vpsb on march  maintenance expenses maintenance expenses increased percent in and percent in primarily due to scheduled increases in plant maintenance 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were virtually unchanged in depreciation and amortization expenses increased percent in primarily due to the amortization of expenditures related to energy conservation programs and the pine street barge canal site environmental matter see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements and to the depreciation of expenditures related to additional investment in the company s distribution facilities 
income taxes the effective federal income tax rates for the years  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the increase in income taxes is primarily due to an increase in taxable income  an increase in the combined federal and state income tax rate and an increase in the reserve for unaudited income tax years 
other income other income decreased percent in primarily due to diminished results by two of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
mountain energy  inc  the company s subsidiary that invests in energy generation and energy and waste water efficiency projects  earned million less in primarily due to start up operating losses incurred by micronair llc  a company in which mountain energy bought a percent interest in  and a decline in rates paid for power generated by one of the california wind facilities in which it has invested 
gmri s loss in was million greater than the loss in due primarily to the development costs of its investment in gmer  the retail energy company in which the company sold a controlling interest to an affiliate of the sam wyly family during the third quarter of other income decreased percent in primarily due to a  loss experienced by gmri 
the impact of the gmri loss on consolidated earnings was diminished to a large extent by offsetting payments received by the company from gmep for work performed on its behalf 
dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock increased percent in and percent in primarily due to the issuance of  shares of the company s percent  class e  series preferred stock in october interest charges interest charges increased percent in primarily due to an increase in long term interest related to the sale of million and million of the company s first mortgage bonds in november and december  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest charges related to a lower amount of short term debt outstanding during the year 
interest charges were virtually unchanged in an increase in interest charges related to a higher amount of long term debt outstanding during the year and a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction were slightly more than offset by a reduction in interest charges related to a lower amount of short term debt outstanding during the year 
transmission issues federal open access tariff orders on april   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued orders and which  among other things  required the filing of open access transmission tariffs by electric utilities  and the functional separation by utilities of their transmission operations from power marketing operations 
order also supports the full recovery of legitimate and verifiable wholesale power costs previously incurred under federal or state regulation 
on july   the company filed with the ferc the non discriminatory open access tariffs required by order and subsequent modifications to the tariff 
the tariff defined the company s transmission system to include subtransmission facilities owned by the company including phase i and phase ii facilities and the company s entitlement to facilities owned by velco 
the company s tariffs included charges related to the use of the velco transmission system by customers 
other vermont utilities required to make filings with the ferc under order followed the same course of action 
on july   the ferc approved the company s open access transmission tariff  and on august  the company filed its compliance refund report 
in accordance with order  the company has also functionally separated its transmission operations and filed with the ferc a code of conduct for its transmission operations 
the company is currently revising the code of conduct in response to a ferc order respecting it issued on november  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects or loss of wholesale customers due to the ferc orders mentioned above 
proposed nepool transmission tariff under an allocation agreement among velco  northeast utilities and new england power corporation the three party agreement  velco currently has percent of the capacity of transmission facilities between new england  new york and canada 
velco s capacity for such transmission facilities is allocated among vermont electric utilities  including the company 
the company s ability to use these delivery paths has been adversely impacted by a proposed nepool open access tariff nepool fourth supplement to amendment on file with the ferc 
under the tariff as filed  transmission capability or transfer capacity between new york and new england will no longer be allocated in a manner consistent with the three party agreement 
instead  rights to the transfer capacity will be made more generally available to the market subject to certain contingencies related to nepool generation availability and accounting for the delivery of various grandfathered contracts 
efforts by the company and other velco members to negotiate with nepool participants for the preservation of rights to deliver long term firm contracts necessary to serve native load on these delivery routes were unsuccessful 
consequently  on november  velco filed with the ferc on behalf of the vermont utilities including the company a motion to intervene and seeking summary judgment with respect to the nepool filing of the fourth supplement filing or the velco filing 
the company and other vermont utilities have argued inter alia that the fourth supplement was a proposal to terminate the vermont utilities existing and future rights under the three party agreement allocating the new york and new england transmission ties and  specifically  the pv tie with the new york power authority nypa 
environmental matters public concern for the environment has resulted in increased government regulation of the licensing and operation of electric generation  transmission and distribution facilities 
the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
the company must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
the company maintains an environmental compliance and monitoring program that includes employee training  regular inspection of company facilities  research and development projects  waste handling and spill prevention procedures and other activities 
subject to developments concerning the pine street barge canal site described below  the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with such requirements  and no material complaints concerning compliance by the company with present environmental protection regulations are outstanding 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund law  generally imposes strict  joint and several liability  regardless of fault  for remediation of property contaminated with hazardous substances 
the company has been notified by the environmental protection agency epa that it is one of several potentially responsible parties prps for cleanup of the pine street barge canal site in burlington  vermont  where coal tar and other industrial materials were deposited 
from the late th century until  gas was manufactured at the pine street barge canal site by a number of enterprises  including the company 
in  the company was one of the parties that agreed to pay a total of  of the epa s past response costs under a consent decree 
the company remains a prp for other past  ongoing and future response costs 
in november  the epa proposed a cleanup plan estimated by the epa to cost million 
in june  the epa withdrew this cleanup plan in response to public concern about the plan and its cost 
the cost of any future cleanup plan  the magnitude of unresolved epa cost recovery claims  and the company s share of such costs are uncertain at this time 
since  the epa has established a coordinating council  with representatives of the prps  environmental and community groups  the city of burlington and the state of vermont presided over by a neutral facilitator 
the council has determined  by consensus  what additional studies were appropriate for the site  and is addressing the question of additional response activities 
the epa  the state of vermont and other parties have entered into two consent orders for completion of appropriate studies 
work is continuing under the second of those orders 
most recently  on september   the council reached tentative agreement on a key component of the proposed remedy for the pine street site  namely  placement of an underwater sand silt cap on areas of the canal and wetland sediments  combined with long term monitoring to ensure effectiveness of the cap and to ensure that groundwater does not reach lake champlain  adjacent to the site 
the epa has estimated the costs of this remedy at between to million  subject to change 
in addition  the council is exploring supplemental projects in and around the site and burlington as part of a larger plan to improve environmental conditions in the vicinity 
on december   the company and two other prps  new england electric system nees and vermont gas systems vgs  entered into a confidential settlement agreement with the state of vermont  the city of burlington and nearly all other landowner prps under which  subject to certain qualifications  the liability of those landowner prps for future superfund response costs would be limited and specified 
on december   the company entered into a confidential agreement with vgs compromising contribution and cost recovery claims of each party and contractual indemnity claims of the company arising from the sale of the manufactured gas plant to vgs 
in march  the company and nees entered into a confidential agreement compromising past and future contribution and cost recovery claims of both parties relating to response costs 
in december  the company and southern union co 
entered into a confidential settlement agreement compromising past and future contribution and cost recovery claims of both parties relating to response costs 
the company has received payment of the full amount provided for in the settlement 
in january  the company and ugi utilities  inc entered into a confidential settlement agreement compromising past and future contribution and cost recovery claims of both parties relating to response costs 
the company has received payment of the initial amount provided for in the settlement 
the epa has advised the company that it has incurred substantial unrecovered response sums at the site which  together with interest the epa alleges may be payable  amount to approximately million 
the company has not yet received a formal demand for these sums 
the company will vigorously dispute the epa s recovery of such costs  which include substantial sums for studies and other activities that were not reasonably necessary and were not undertaken consistent with legal and regulatory requirements 
further  the company s agreements with certain prp s will reduce the extent to which it may bear these past response costs 
consequently  the company is not able at this time to predict with certainty whether  or the extent to which  it will be required to pay such past response costs 
in december  the company brought suit against eight previous insurers seeking recovery of unrecovered past costs  cost of defense and indemnity against future liabilities associated with environmental problems at the site 
discovery in the case  which was previously subject to a stay  is complete 
the company has reached confidential settlements with the defendants in this litigation  several such settlements are in the final stages of documentation 
the company has deferred amounts received from third parties  under confidential settlements  pending resolution of the company s ultimate liability with respect to the site and rate recognition of that liability 
although the cost of the coordinating council s tentative remediation plan  described above  is not expected to approach the epa s earlier estimate of remediation costs for its original clean up plan  the current epa estimate is subject to change 
since the company believes it may prevail with respect to some of the epa s unrecovered response costs  the company is unable to predict at this time the magnitude of any liability resulting from potential claims for the costs to investigate and remediate the site  or the likely disposition or magnitude of claims the company may have against others  including its insurers  except to the extent described above 
through rate cases filed in    and  the company has sought and received recovery for ongoing expenses associated with the pine street barge canal site 
specifically  the company proposed rate recognition of its unrecovered expenditures incurred between january  and june  in the total of approximately million for technical consultants and legal assistance in connection with the epa s enforcement action at the site and insurance litigation 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of rate recovery for the pine street barge canal site related costs  the company and the department reached agreements in these cases that the full amount of the pine street barge canal site costs reflected in those rate cases should be recovered in rates 
the company s rates approved by the vpsb in those proceedings reflected the pine street barge canal site related expenditures referred to above 
the company proposed in the rate filing made on june  recovery of an additional million in such expenditures 
in an order released march   the vpsb suspended the amortization of expenditures associated with the pine street barge canal site pending further proceedings 
although it did not eliminate the rate base deferral of these expenditures  or make any specific order in this regard  the vpsb indicated that it was inclined to agree with other parties in the case that the ultimate costs associated with the pine street barge canal site  taking into account recoveries from insurance carriers and other prp s  should be shared between customers and shareholders of the company 
as of december   total expenditures for the pine street barge canal site were million  inclusive of the million referred to above 
an authoritative accounting standard  statement of position sop  has been issued by the accounting profession addressing environmental remediation obligations 
this sop is effective for years beginning in  and addresses  among other things  regulatory benchmarks that are likely triggers of the accrual of estimated losses  the costs included in the measurement  including incremental costs of remediation efforts such as post remediation monitoring and long term operation and maintenance costs and costs of compensation and related benefits of employees devoting time to the remediation 
this sop  adopted by the company in january  as required  did not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
clean air act because the company purchases most of its power supply from other utilities  it does not anticipate that it will incur any material direct cost increases as a result of the federal clean air act or proposals to make more stringent regulations under that act 
furthermore  only one of its power supply purchase contracts  which expires in early  relates to a generating plant that is likely to be affected by the acid rain provisions of this legislation 
overall  approximately percent of the company s committed electricity supply a contract to purchase coal fired generation that expires in early is expected to be affected by federal and state environmental compliance requirements 
liquidity and capital resources construction the company s capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
if restructuring does occur  the company will reassess its capital expenditures for generation and other projects and the terms of financing thereof 
capital expenditures over the past three years and projected for are as follows total net actual generation transmission distribution conservation other expenditures dollars in thousands and net of afudc and customer advances for construction forecasted includes and million for wind project in and  respectively 
rates on june   the company filed a request with the vpsb to increase retail rates by percent million in additional annual revenues and the target return on common equity from percent to percent 
initial hearings before the vpsb began november  the vpsb allowed the intervention of various other parties 
in august  several groups  including the vermont public interest research group vpirg  demanded that the vpsb appoint an independent counsel to advocate against recovery of hydro quebec power costs by the company 
the vpsb issued an order appointing an independent investigator  described as a person or persons who will perform a rigorous and impartial analysis of the company s actions with respect to its power supply options  including the hydro quebec contract 
on november   the vpsb selected a firm  msb energy associates  inc msb to undertake the tasks 
in testimony filed with the vpsb on october   the department asked the vpsb to find the company s negotiation  execution and decision to lock in the contract with hydro quebec to be imprudent and uneconomic 
the department had supported the contract in the period after completing its own analysis  based on substantially the same information that was available to the company 
the vpsb in   and issued orders that determined the contract to be needed to supply electricity to vermont customers  economically beneficial to the state and an appropriate part of the company s legally required least cost integrated resource plan 
on october   the company filed with the vpsb objections and a motion to strike relating to the hydro quebec contract testimony and requested that the vpsb schedule oral argument on the motion prior to november  the grounds for the motion were that the vpsb had previously decided the issues sought to be relitigated 
the vpsb heard argument on the motion on november  and ruled against the company  but granted the company leave to renew the motion 
the company did so in its post hearing briefs 
in its testimony  submitted in late  msb was critical of the company s power supply decision making in  and recommended a steep disallowance of the hydro quebec power costs  in excess of million per year 
during the rebuttal phase of the rate case  the company showed that msb was not independent and did not present rigorous analysis as the vpsb had ordered 
msb s presentation adopted the testimony of the department s principal witnesses as well as theories espoused by a professional expert retained by ibm and msb failed to present its own analysis showing that  based on any information possessed or available to the company during the critical summer and fall of  the long term hydro quebec contract was uneconomic 
the company filed a motion to strike the msb testimony and to impose sanctions upon msb for submitting testimony without any good faith factual or legal basis 
the vpsb struck several portions of msb s testimony forming the core of their arguments on imprudence  based on legal or contract interpretation  on the ground that msb had no qualifications to present this testimony 
briefs in the case on non hydro quebec issues were filed january   the hydro quebec briefs were filed on february  all reply briefs were filed on february in its final submissions  the company reduced the requested increase to percent million in additional annual revenues due to changed estimates of costs to be incurred in the rate year 
on march   the vpsb released a decision in the rate case 
the order granted a million increase in annual revenue in response to the company s request for a million increase in annual revenue 
the company is exploring all legal and regulatory remedies open to it to challenge the vpsb s decision 
the vpsb s ruling  if not changed  would have a significant adverse impact on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations and  depending on future proceedings to be conducted by the vpsb  could impact the company s credit rating  dividend policy and financial viability 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion 
dividend policy on september   the company s board of directors announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend from per share to per share on the company s common stock 
historically  the company has based its dividend policy on the continued validity of three assumptions the ability to achieve earnings growth  the receipt of an allowed rate of return that accurately reflects the company s cost of capital  and the retention of its exclusive franchise 
the company s common stock dividend payout has ranged from to percent of earnings over the past five years 
the company s revised dividend policy  which incorporates a target payout ratio of to percent  reflects the greater risks facing the company as a result of the changing environment of the electric utility industry 
this policy contemplates a target payout that is in line with industry trends and is comparable to that of other companies in the utility industry 
the policy assumes fair and appropriate ratemaking 
however  the vpsb s recent rate order  if unchanged  will require the company to reassess the current dividend level 
financing and capitalization for the period through  internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provided approximately percent of total capital requirements for construction  sinking funds and other requirements 
the company anticipates that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of total capital requirements for regulated operations 
at december   the company s capitalization consisted of percent common equity  percent long term debt and percent preferred equity 
the company has a comprehensive capital plan to increase the equity component of its capital structure 
in may  the rating of the company s first mortgage bonds by standard poor s was upgraded from bbb to a  reflecting standard poor s revised assessment of the ultimate recovery risk of the senior secured debt of utilities 
the company s corporate credit rating remains at bbb 
the preferred stock rating remains at bbb 
in march  standard poor s placed the company s credit ratings on creditwatch with negative implications in reaction to what they characterize as an adverse ruling by the vpsb regarding the company s rate increase request 
the rating of the company s first mortgage bonds by duff phelps remains at bbb 
the ratings of the company s preferred stock remains at bbb 
in march  duff phelps placed the company s credit ratings on rating watch down in reaction to what they characterize as a negative outcome in the company s rate increase request decided by the vpsb 
the rating of the company s first mortgage bonds by moody s investment services remains at baa the rating of the company s preferred stock remains at baa in march  moody s changed its rating outlook for the company to negative and indicated the company s credit ratings were pressured in reaction to what they characterize as a negative order from the vpsb regarding the company s rate increase request

year computer compliance the company utilizes software and related technologies throughout its businesses that will be affected by the date change in the year the company is in the process of implementing new customer service and financial systems which are year compliant 
an internal study is currently underway to determine the full scope and related costs to insure that the company s systems continue to meet its internal needs and those of its customers 
maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life 
these expenditures may be significant and continue through the year the company expects to have achieved compliance with year requirements for its financial and operating systems by june  failure to comply by january  would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt
