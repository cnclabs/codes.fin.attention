overview from its founding  the company s focus has been large  long duration us government programs in defense intelligence  ultra reliable hf communications systems and high power broadcasting systems 
to meet the demands of a changing world market brought about by the end of the cold war  the company has sought to diversify its product offerings in the s 
as a result  its primary focus has changed from military to more commercial applications with a customer mix dominated by international entities and domestic non governmental broadcasting organizations 
today  the company has three core product lines  the broadcast and communications division bcd  the signal processing division spd  and the test and measurement division tmd 
bcd offers antenna systems for medium wave broadcasting and broad band antenna solutions for hf broadcasting and communications systems 
recently  the company has introduced proprietary antenna and transmission feeder solutions for the fm and tv broadcast markets 
spd sells direction finding  signal collection  and specialized communication receiver and transmitter equipment into military and intelligence markets 
the company s core products consist of receivers and transmitters  dsp based direction finding processors  and specialized application software that routinely operate from khz to ghz in frequency 
tmd was created in to introduce commercial variants of the company s direction finding technology into the itu spectrum monitoring market 
its product offerings consist of specialized application and database software and proprietary monitoring  measurement  and direction finding hardware that operates from khz to ghz 
these systems are used by national regulatory agencies in foreign countries similar in function to the federal communications commission fcc to maintain order and discipline in the radio spectrum 
management believes that each of the three product lines offers core technology in stable marketplaces that is of significant value 
however  in order to achieve substantial growth in revenues and profits  the company must continue to find ways to diversify and leverage its technology and intellectual capital into adjacent  growing markets 
in this regard  the company  teamed with hewlett packard  achieved its first diversification successes in fiscal and as it won contracts to supply radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance sms equipment to foreign customers 
in march  in an effort to increase both its market share and its gross profit  tmd committed itself to replace the equipment previously supplied by hewlett packard with an all dsp based solution of proprietary origin and design 
during fiscal  tmd won its first two contracts for the supply of this new generation equipment 
as a result of the company s expenditure on sms research and development efforts  it has developed a full featured uhf vhf direction finding and comint hardware platform suitable for direction finding and specialized communications intelligence opportunities of interest to friendly military and intelligence customers 
the availability of these new products will allow spd to pursue a select group of uhf vhf opportunities with domestic and overseas military and intelligence customers 
currently  no additional development funds are planned to further develop the hardware platform 
the company expects  however  that additional development will be required to add software features necessary to prosecute certain types of digital modulation formats inherent in today s digital communication systems 
in order to more quickly realize its financial objectives  the company is pursuing relationships with potential strategic partners who offer complimentary features  such as software capabilities or an established presence in markets not currently served by the company 
the same research and development efforts have afforded the company the opportunity to leverage the combination of its dsp based products and software with its specialized receiver and down converter products into a large specialized automated test and measurement ate equipment market 
the company plans to partner with at least one significant vendor in this market to jointly offer custom products and solutions 
management believes that the company has application software skills and experience with rf component integration that is unique and is of substantial value to these specialized ate markets 
current efforts are focused on establishing an effective distribution channel 
the company s bcd is expanding into offering the supply of digital tv and fm broadcasting equipment 
the company has designed and has begun selling a line of fm antennas in both domestic and international markets 
in addition  management believes the fcc mandated switch from analog tv frequency assignments to digital assignments will create a substantial requirement for new antenna  feeder and transmission systems in the us market between now and the year consequently  bcd s focus will be on developing products for this market that offer proprietary solutions to the adjacent channel assignment problem and providing engineering services to deal with installations of new antennas on existing tower structures 
the company believes that with the right strategic partners it can win a significant share of business in this market 
this opportunity will require investment in development during each of the next three years 
while the transmission formats are different  there exists an overseas market for similar digital tv technology 
efforts are currently underway to explore these markets more fully in australia and europe 
during the last three years the company has expended approximately  on internal research and ir d efforts related to its product and market diversification efforts 
all costs for such product development are presently funded internally and are expensed as incurred 
the company expects that the future costs of these and other efforts  including potential acquisitions  may be significant enough to generate a loss from operations in fiscal the investment of financial and human resources will continue in each of these commercial efforts until either successful product introduction is achieved or it is determined that a viable market does not exist for these products 
in addition to ir d  a significant portion of engineering effort is customer sponsored by both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
such engineering effort relates to the design and development of new products as well as improvements to existing products 
expenditures for customer sponsored research  development and engineering were approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
additionally  a portion of new product development work of a conceptual nature is charged to bid and proposal costs when the development may lead to an immediate  potential contract 
on july   the company announced that it had signed an agreement with a nasd registered investment banking entity to assist the company with the enhancement of shareholder value 
as a result  the company has been party to strategic discussions with a select group of organizations  both domestic and international  which may serve to leverage the company s core technology and intellectual capital into adjacent  faster growing and higher margin market segments 
separately  the company has entered discussions with various financial institutions regarding it s objective of increasing the percentage ownership of common stock held by institutional investors and in order to create greater research coverage of its common stock by industry analysts and market makers 
although there can be no certainty as to the ultimate outcome of these efforts  management believes this effort will contribute to the accomplishment of its primary goal for fiscal increasing shareholder value 
the company s funded backlog as of september   was approximately million  compared to approximately million as of september  the following table sets forth the total backlog  which includes the value of unexercised options on us government contracts which the company believed were likely to be exercised  for the periods indicated in thousands as of september  backlog  of the million backlog at fiscal year end  approximately million is expected to be recognized as revenue prior to september  most contracts are  by their nature  subject to termination for cause or default and  on occasion  can be terminated for reasons beyond the control of the company 
the company s backlog reflects several factors that have combined to reduce sales to the company s traditional customers for its broadcast and signal processing products 
the first factor has been the end of the cold war which has reduced the us government s requirements for high power short wave broadcasting systems manufactured by bcd and for signal processing systems used by us military organizations that are manufactured by spd 
the second factor is the declining economies in asia  africa  and the middle east that have reduced civilian budgets and resulted in cancellation or delay of projects using the company s equipment 
the third factor  related to the economic decline overseas  is the increase in value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of most of the company s customers 
this has made the company s products appear more expensive than those of its foreign competitors 
the company expects to reverse the decline in its backlog by redirecting its engineering  manufacturing  and marketing efforts to products and market segments that are less affected by these general trends 
among these are digital tv products for the us broadcasting industry  signal collection systems used by foreign military organizations for intelligence or other national security operations  and test and measurement products used by telecommunications organizations for regulatory operations or system testing 
all of these market segments are growing and present significant sales opportunities for the company s new products 
results of operations as an aid to understanding the company s consolidated operating results  the following table indicates the percentage relationships of income and expense items for each of the last three fiscal years 
percentage of revenue years ended september  revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue marketing  general and administrative loss from operations investment income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes 

net income loss the approximate revenue attributable to contracts from both domestic and overseas customers is shown below in thousands domestic revenue    overseas revenue    total    fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased by while the net loss decreased by when compared to fiscal the delay or loss of key program awards in asia  latin america and europe adversely affected revenues in fiscal most of these programs were bid under highly competitive pricing situations 
recent economic uncertainties in asia and latin america  coupled with the devaluation of currencies against the us dollar  have intensified pricing pressures across all product lines 
in addition  adversely affecting revenues and corresponding gross profits in fiscal was the unexpected delay in obtaining system acceptance of one significant overseas contract 
an exceptionally high management and technical personnel turnover rate within the customer s organization during the course of the contract created a lack of understanding of the system s original goals and objectives and hindered acceptance of the system 
the company continues to work diligently with the customer to address all outstanding issues  including the need to conduct additional training before and after the system acceptance  and using third party independent experts to assist the customer in the process of system acceptance 
management remains confident that it will achieve system acceptance and field a system that meets the customer s expectations 
during fiscal  the company recorded an adjustment reflecting management s best estimate of additional cost to bring this contract to completion 
to date  the company has received payment of approximately  or of the total contract value 
the company has an outstanding performance bond equivalent of  or of the contract value 
in order to ensure the success of future projects of this type  the company plans to change how these systems are delivered to customers 
in the future  a consulting team consisting of technical  functional and business experts will be focused on each project from the beginning 
this team will manage the project in partnership with the customer 
as part of the implementation  customers will be able to run a series of pilot tests to ensure that their ultimate goals and objectives can be realized at the end of the implementation 
an extensive training curriculum specifically tailored for the customer will be designed and conducted during system implementation 
this process should serve to eliminate all uncertainties regarding how the system will work once installed and should contribute substantially to the stream of after sale revenue 
the cost of revenue expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal decreased to from last year 
this decrease was due to an inventory adjustment of  made in fiscal year this inventory adjustment was the result of lower demand for the br product line  which was designed originally for military and specialized communications purposes 
without the inventory adjustment in fiscal  the cost of revenue would have decreased to from 
the additional favorable decrease of in cost of revenue expressed as a percentage of revenue was due to the mix of contracts being executed in fiscal that had inherently lower margins than those executed during fiscal marketing  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue increased to from 
this increase was partly due to a lower revenue level in fiscal actual marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal this decrease was due largely to lower agent commission expenses 
investment income decreased by or  this decrease was due to the lower interest rates earned on investments and a decrease in cash available for investment 
net loss decreased from  to  or 
the decrease in net loss was due largely to the inventory adjustment made in fiscal of  the company is currently reorganizing itself to focus on achieving divisional profitability objectives in its product lines 
as part of this effort  the company will pursue opportunities to reorganize  consolidate  or eliminate underperforming parts of its current business while satisfying all of its customer and product support obligations 
the company will place a greater emphasis on generating gross profits from its current product offerings 
achieving growth in sales and earnings represents the company s ultimate goal and the company will be aggressively implementing the growth strategies imbedded in its current operating plan 
fiscal compared to fiscal the revenue growth experienced in fiscal over fiscal was mainly due to the company s diversification success in the radio monitoring and spectrum compliance market 
revenue for fiscal increased by over revenue in fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased by in fiscal when compared to fiscal this was due to an inventory write down in fiscal of  the inventory write down was a result of a decrease in customer demand for the existing br communications product line 
this product line was originally designed for military and highly specialized communication purposes 
but such communication requirements are now being satisfied by the use of various commercial communications mediums which provide faster  more robust means of communicating  including secure satellite and other wireless communication technologies 
in addition  cost of revenues reflected the company s execution of a backlog that consists of inherently lower margin contracts 
marketing  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue slightly increased in fiscal from to 
this was due largely to the greater emphasis placed on marketing and selling related activities  as well as a general increase in personnel costs 
investment income in fiscal decreased by  over fiscal due to a higher cash balance available for investment in fiscal the cash balance in fiscal was positively impacted by a significant customer deposit received from an overseas contract 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was of net loss before income taxes compared to of net income before income taxes in fiscal the tax provision recorded in fiscal was to cover the company s foreign tax liability associated with the execution of a certain contract in a south american country 
because no tax treaty exists between the u 
s 
and this south american country  the company was not able to offset these tax liabilities with its net operating loss carryforward originally generated in fiscal net loss as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was compared to in fiscal factors that may affect future operating results the company operates in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons 
while there is no seasonality to the company s business  because of the company s relative small size  combined with the extended delivery cycles of its long term project oriented business  revenue and accompanying gross margins are inherently difficult to predict 
because the company plans its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  based on the assumption of stable performance  a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause profitability from operations to suffer 
historically  the company has endured periods of volatility in its revenue results due to a number of factors  including shortfalls in new orders  delays in the availability of new products  delays in subcontractor provided materials and services  and delays associated with foreign construction activities 
gross margins are strongly influenced by a mix of considerations  including pressures to be the low price supplier in competitive bid solicitations  the mix of contract material and non recurring engineering services  and the mix of newly developed and existing products sold to various customers 
the company believes these historical challenges will continue to affect its future business 
the company intends to leverage its expertise in rf technology applications and its ability to conduct business in foreign markets by pursuing outside technology and business acquisitions which complement various characteristics of its existing core businesses 
the company expects that the future cost of this product diversification strategy may be significant enough to generate a loss from operations during any fiscal quarter through the end of fiscal managing a changing business the company is in the process of adopting a business management plan that includes substantial investments in its sales and marketing organizations  increased funding of existing internal research and development programs  and certain investments in corporate infrastructure that will be required to support the company s diversification objectives during the next three years 
accompanying this process are a number of risks  including a higher level of operating expenses  the difficulty of competing with companies of larger size for talented technical personnel  and the complexities of managing a changing business 
there also exists the risk the company may inaccurately estimate the viability of any one or all of its diversification efforts and as a result  may experience substantial revenue shortfalls of a size so significant as to generate losses from operations 
risk associated with expansion into additional markets and product development the company believes that its future success is substantially dependent on its ability to successfully acquire  develop and commercialize new products and penetrate new markets 
in addition to the company s ongoing efforts to diversify its product offerings within its core broadcast  signal processing and test and measurement  the company intends to pursue a diverse  but focused product and market development initiative during the next three years 
the company believes that its general knowledge of rf technology and its related applications combined with its proven ability to conduct business in overseas markets can be exploited to return the company to an aggressive growth posture 
while not strictly limited to these product areas  the company is currently pursuing development of proprietary broad band antenna systems for fm and tv broadcasting and specialized receivers and processors to increase the usefulness and reduce the cost of its signal processing and test and measurement systems 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully develop these or any other additional products  that any such products will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable cost  or that any such products will achieve market acceptance 
should the company expend funds to acquire outside entities or technology  there can be no assurance that sufficient returns will be realized to offset these investments 
the inability of the company to successfully develop or commercialize new products or failure of such products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with conducting business overseas a substantial part of the company s revenue is derived from fixed priced contracts with foreign governmental entities 
with increasing frequency  the company finds a demand for its products in third world countries and developing nations which have an inherently more volatile and uncertain political and credit risk profile than the us government market with which the company is accustom to conducting its business 
while the company seeks to minimize the collection risks on these contracts by normally securing significant advanced payments with the balance secured by irrevocable letters of credit  the company cannot always be assured of receiving full payment for work that it has performed due to unforeseen credit and political risks 
the company is in the process of executing contract obligations in a number of countries that have been subjected to substantial devaluations of currency during the last fiscal year 
while the majority of payments owed the company are made in us dollars and are secured before product shipment with irrevocable letters of credit  scenarios could occur that make it difficult for the company to collect all the money owed against the payment of a given contract 
should such a default on payments owed the company ever occur  a significant effect on earnings  cash flows and cash balances may result 
competition most all of the company s products are positioned in niche markets which include strong elements of imbedded proprietary technology 
in most of these markets  the company competes with companies of significantly larger size  many of whom have substantially greater technical  marketing  and financial resources compared to similar resources available within the company 
this type of competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant price competition 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations in fiscal and fiscal was 
million and million  respectively 
cash provided from operations was million in fiscal in fiscal cash used in operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  and a prepayment of million in sales tax vat for importation of equipment under an overseas contract offset by cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to the timing between revenue recognition  billings and collections 
different payment terms are negotiated for each contract  depending on the customer 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to payments made to a significant subcontractor 
the prepayment for sales tax will be offset against the sales tax to be collected from the customer which is expected to be final billed in fiscal in fiscal cash provided by operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and customer deposit and billing on uncompleted contracts in excess of revenue recognized of million 
in fiscal cash was principally provided from a net income of million  and an increase in accounts payable of million resulting in total net cash provided from operations of million 
cash of million was used in investing activities in fiscal through the maturity of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million and cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million 
as of september   the company had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
as of the same date  the company had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately million 
these standby letters of credit are collateralized by the company s cash or short term investments 
see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently believes that its cash and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations through fiscal a significant portion of the company s revenues is associated with long term contracts and programs in which there are significant inherent risks 
these risks include the uncertainty of economic conditions  dependence on future appropriations and administrative allotments of funds  changes in governmental policies  difficulty of forecasting costs and work schedules  product obsolescence  and other factors characteristic of the industry 
contracts with agencies of the us government or with prime contractors working on us government contracts contain provisions permitting termination at any time for the convenience of the government 
no assurance can be given regarding future financial results as such results are dependent upon many factors  including economic and competitive conditions  incoming order levels  shipment volume  product margins and foreign exchange rates 
the large size of certain of the company s orders makes it possible that a single contract termination  cancellation  delay  or failure to perform could have a significant adverse effect on revenue  results of operations  and the cash position of the company 
a portion of the company s revenues is derived from governments in areas of political instability 
the company generally attempts to reduce the risks associated with such instability by requesting advance payments if appropriate  as well as letters of credit or central government guarantees 
most of the company s overseas contracts provide for payments in us dollars 
however  in certain instances the company  for competitive reasons  must accept payment in a foreign currency 
management does not consider inflation to be a significant factor in its operations 
year issue many currently installed computer systems and software products are designed to accept only two digit entries in the date field 
soon  beginning january   these date fields must accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
if a computer system or software product is not year compliant  it may not operate properly during the transition from december  l to january   and may not recognize the year as a leap year 
a non compliant system or product may suddenly halt  continue operating but interpret or calculate data incorrectly  or otherwise operate improperly  causing disruption to the company s operations or the operations of others 
in order to minimize the disruption to business and government that may be caused by computer systems and software products that are not yk compliant  many companies and government agencies worldwide have established programs to evaluate and mitigate the risks and adverse effects of the yk problem 
accordingly  the company has established a program to review and assess yk compliance of its internal business systems  manufacturing and design tools  current products  products sold in recent years  and the most critical systems  services and products supplied to the company by third parties 
the company has assigned a program manager  accountable to executive management  to oversee  coordinate  and report on the company s yk assessment and remediation efforts 
a four phase approach has been defined to determine the year readiness of the company s systems  software  equipment  and products 
such approach is expected to provide a detailed method for tracking the evaluation  repair  and testing of systems  software  equipment and products that may be affected by yk issues 
phase  assessment  includes taking an inventory of all systems  software  equipment and products  and the identification of those with year issues which need remediation 
phase also calls for the preparation of plans needed for remediation 
phase  remediation  includes repairing  upgrading  and or replacing any non compliant equipment or systems identified in phase phase  testing  includes testing the company s systems  software  and equipment for year readiness  or in certain cases  relying on test results or certifications provided to the company by third parties 
phase  implementation  involves placing compliant systems  software  and equipment into service 
as part of the phase effort  the company began preparing an inventory of its critically important systems and is currently determining specific remediation approaches 
in doing so  the company has determined that it must replace the year old software and hardware used in its internal business system 
this system is used for numerous day to day operations  such as general and project planning and accounting  purchasing  inventory management  production planning and control  and quality assurance 
a steering committee comprised of senior management in key functional areas  including accounting  engineering  marketing and manufacturing  has been established to oversee the selection and implementation of a new business system 
a detailed assessment of the company s requirements for a new business system was completed 
the company plans to start the implementation process in january with a target date for completion in june if the company should not complete the implementation by january   the company will and has the capability to operate manually until the implementation is complete 
also underway during phase is an inventory of all current company products  as well as those which have been delivered to customers in recent years 
this inventory is being reviewed to identify those products for which the yk issue may be critical 
current products  and recently delivered products still under warranty  will be corrected as necessary 
for older company products that are determined to be critically non compliant  the company may offer moderate cost software or hardware upgrades 
preliminary reviews of the company s three major product lines indicate that few products  if any  are not yk compliant 
although most of the company s antenna products do not include computers of any kind  some larger antenna systems rely on small to mid sized computers for automatic monitoring and control functions 
generally  these computers are not date sensitive and do not perform date sensitive calculations 
the company believes that the planned detailed review of the antenna product line will not reveal any significant yk non compliances in the antenna product line 
the company has conducted a preliminary review of its sounder product line and believes that few products  if any  are critically yk non compliant 
older ionospheric sounder systems did not incorporate computers or other devices which were date sensitive  making them inherently yk compliant 
however  newer sounder systems  designed and produced in the last few years  use integrated computers for system control  data analysis  and data logging 
some of these computers  using company developed software  create and store files which are identified by dates provided by third party operating system software 
these systems do not perform calculations or analyses using date information  but use dates solely to identify stored records 
based on the preliminary reviews of both the older and newer products  the company believes that the planned detailed review of the sounder product line will not reveal any significant yk non compliances 
the company s spectrum management products are heavily dependent on company developed software and third party computers and operating systems 
these systems are typically tasked by external customer equipment to perform certain real time measurements and analyses  and to report the results immediately to the customer s equipment 
although the time of the measurement and analysis is reported back to the customer s equipment  the date is typically not included 
since the date is not used in the measurements  analyses  or reports  the company believes that its past and current spectrum management products are substantially yk compliant 
some systems  however  may require the users to perform simple  one time procedures to allow the system to continue functioning properly after the to transition 
the company expects to identify those systems  develop the corrective procedures  and notify the users well before the transition 
the cost of this effort has been included in the company s estimate of the overall costs to achieve company wide yk compliance as stated below 
the planned  detailed review of this product line is not expected to reveal any additional  significant yk non compliances 
in addition to the reviews of its current and past products  the company plans to initiate communications with significant third party vendors and suppliers whose systems  services or products are important to the company s operations 
this will help resolve mutual yk issues before they become critical  and should minimize possible disruptions to the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that yk non compliant systems and products of other companies on which the company relies  and for which the company has no direct compliance knowledge or control  will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
if the company determines its primary suppliers are not yk compliant  then additional inventory may be purchased prior to january   and or alternative suppliers that are yk compliant may be identified 
the failure to correct material year problems could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could negatively affect the company s business  and the general uncertainty inherent in yk problems makes it impossible to determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
the company believes that the greatest single  controllable risk posed by yk non compliance is its internal business system  which if uncorrected could result in material business disruption and the company s inability to meet committed product delivery dates 
the company has  therefore  focused the majority of its current remedial effort on its internal business system 
it expects the timely replacement of the system will significantly reduce the possibility of yk related interruptions of its normal operations 
in addition to being year complaint  the acquisition of this new business system will provide more visibility and increase efficiency in our business processes 
the total cost to address the year problem and upgrade the current business system is estimated to not be more than  the company conducts a fair amount of business overseas  mostly to third world countries 
the company might be precluded from traveling to these countries because of yk issues beyond its control 
this might have a significant impact on the company s ability to meet delivery and installation schedules 
the company believes it is diligently addressing the year issues and that it will satisfactorily identify and resolve critical and significant yk problems in its operations and products 
the assessment and remediation plan is expected to significantly reduce the level of uncertainty about the yk problem in the company s internal systems  its products  and its critical third party suppliers 
it believes it has assigned adequate resources to its yk compliance plan to complete substantially all phases during fiscal  with major completion milestones in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
it requires classification of other comprehensive income  as defined by the standard  by their nature eg  unrealized gains or losses on securities in a financial statement  but does not require a specific format for that statement 
the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income is to be displayed separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
the company does not believe the implementation of this sfas will have a material impact on the financial position of the company 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the statement requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments on the basis that is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated and accounted for as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
this statement will be effective for all annual and interim periods beginning after june   and management does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivatives and financial instruments foreign currency hedging instruments the company transacts business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to pesos denominated payments in colombia  a contract denominated in british pounds sterling and local currency denominated operating expenses in the u 
k 
where the company sells primarily in u 
s 
dollars 
however  as of september   the company had no hedging contracts outstanding 
the company s uk operating expenses are in sterling  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to the contract denominated in sterling 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in the uk instead  the company believes that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenues will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
the company assesses the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does the company hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program 
no sensitivity analysis was performed on the company s hedging portfolio as of september  as there was no hedging contracts outstanding as of september  fixed income investments the company s investments in us corporate securities include commercial paper 
foreign securities include certificates of deposit with financial institutions  most of which are denominated in us dollars 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments have generally been held until maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses were negligible as of september  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investments 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments 
the average interest rate on the investment portfolio is 
as of september   there are no investments with maturities greater than months 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio
