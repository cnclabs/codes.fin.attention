item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors affecting future results 
overview the company was founded in as an outgrowth of certain research and development efforts initially undertaken by the company s founders in the early s related to the use of laser technology to treat cardiovascular disease 
from through september  the company engaged in research  development and sale of surgical laser products principally for procedures such as atherectomy and arthroscopy 
in  the company determined that there is a significant opportunity in the tmr market  and that the company is well positioned to enter this market because of the company s expertise with laser based surgical techniques and the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
accordingly  in late  the company changed its strategic direction 
prior to  the company had focused almost exclusively on research and development activities relating to surgical laser products  substantially contributing to annual operating losses since inception 
since  the company has focused on tmr and ptmr activities  particularly research and development activities and clinical trials 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there are currently seven clinical trials in progress in either tmr or ptmr 
the company has submitted an application to the fda for marketing clearance pma or pre market approval of its tmr products in the united states 
the company has received the european conforming mark ce mark allowing the commercial sale of its tmr laser system to the european community 
the company expects to continue to incur operating losses related to the expansion of sales and marketing resources  research and development activities  including clinical studies  and the continued development of corporate infrastructure 
the timing and amounts of the company s expenditures will depend upon a number of factors  including the progress of the company s clinical trials  the status and timing of regulatory approval  the timing of market acceptance  if any  of the company s products  and the efforts required to develop the company s sales and marketing organization 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues net revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to net revenues of  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a change in the mix of lasers sold versus placed 
this change was primarily due to a health care financing administration hcfa policy effective may  which restricts medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures 
the company s products had received third party reimbursement under the preceding hcfa policy 
reimbursement is a significant factor considered by hospitals in determining whether to acquire new equipment 
future revenues could continue to be affected by restrictions on third party reimbursement and the timing and manner of sale of a limited number of units of tmr and ptmr laser systems 
the company intends to continue selling the systems to the hospital outright list price is  or placing the system with the hospital for a placement fee currently  plus an additional fee for each procedure performed 
the company has also made contingency placements which are not taken as revenue until a sale ensues only after fda approval is received or hcfa reimbursement becomes available 
as a result of the hcfa policy restricting medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures  the company anticipates that these sales will continue to be more difficult to obtain in the future than prior to the effective date of the policy 
gross profit gross profit decreased to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a higher level of manufacturing overhead associated with facility and infrastructure expansion including increased headcount  as well as a lower average sales price per laser in due to the higher mix of lasers placed versus sold in as compared to research and development expenses research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses reflects a higher level of costs related to the development of new products  and increases in the number of clinical trials and the cost of supporting clinical trials  and an increase in headcount to from research and development employees at december  as compared to december  the company s products are currently in clinical trials and therefore subject to limitations by the fda 
the company believes that continued investment in the development of new and improved products and procedures and continued investment in the company s clinical trials is critical to its future success 
as a result of the new hcfa policy restricting medicare reimbursement for tmr and ptmr equipment and procedures  the company reimbursed clinical sites for expenses incurred in conjunction with performing clinical trials 
the company anticipates a significant increase in future expenditures relating to hospital support of the company s clinical trials as the number of clinical trials increases 
accordingly  the company believes that research and development expenses may continue to increase over the short term and possibly thereafter 
there can be no assurance that the company s future revenues  if any  will be sufficient to offset the research and development expenses required in connection with ongoing efforts including current and future clinical trials 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to a headcount increase to in from nine in this resulted in significant increases in salary  commission and travel expense 
the additional headcount has been utilized in the areas of international sales  service  training and clinical support to the increasing number of clinical sites 
the company expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as the company continues to focus resources on the development of the tmr and ptmr market 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in as compared to reflects an increase in patent and patent related expenses 
at december   the company had patents or allowed patent applications and patent applications pending relating to various aspects of tmr  ptmr and other cardiovascular therapies as compared to five and at december  the increase also reflects expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including investor relations fees  legal  accounting and stock administration expenses incurred throughout the year as compared to seven months in interest income and expense  net interest income of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the investment of funds received in connection with an initial public offering in may for twelve months in as compared to seven months in interest expense of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease reflects the use of funds from the initial public offering to repay debt  resulting in a lower debt level in as compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to  in from  in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the introduction of the company s tmr products at the end of resulting in increased sales in the last quarter of and throughout the increase in revenues also resulted in an increase in net accounts receivable to  at december  from  at december  since  the company has focused on the tmr market 
sales of tmr related products accounted for and of revenues in and respectively 
gross profit gross profit increased to  in from  in gross margin increased to in  from a gross margin of in the increase in gross margin in from reflects increased sales of tmr products which generally have a higher margin than non tmr surgical products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in these expenses in reflects a higher level of research and development expenses relating to tmr including costs related to the introduction of five new tmr products  filing patent applications  costs to introduce and support four clinical trials  and an increase in headcount to research and development employees at december  from six at december  sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in reflects expansion of the company s sales and marketing staff to nine in from six in  increased travel and trade show expenses  costs to develop the international market  and increased commission expense related to increased sales  expenses associated with the commencement of clinical trials for the company s tmr products and associated recruitment of participating physicians and hospitals 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in as compared to reflects increased headcount to at december  from five in december   and expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including investor relations fees  legal  accounting and stock administration expenses 
interest income and expense  net interest income  net of interest expense  of  in reflects investment income from the proceeds of the company s public offering 
interest expense  net of interest income  was  in the outstanding debt at december  was repaid from july through february resulting in a decrease in interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has satisfied its capital requirements primarily through sales of its equity securities and  to a lesser extent  loans from shareholders 
in addition  the company s operations have been funded in part through sales of the company s products 
at december   the company had aggregate cash and marketable securities of  and at december   the company had cash and marketable securities of  the company used  and  for operating activities in and  respectively 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company anticipates that its current cash and marketable securities  together with sales of products for investigational use  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through at least calendar year there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional sources of cash at an earlier date in the future  depending upon the progress of expansion of the company s clinical trials  any need for additional clinical trials or other testing of the company s products  and the timing of other required expenditures as indicated above 
if the company is required to obtain additional financing in the future  there can be no assurance that capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
recently issued accounting standards management does not believe there are any recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted by the company  the future adoption of which will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting future results certain of the statements above are forward looking statements 
in addition  the company may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
the following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements 
early stage of clinical trials the company must obtain marketing clearance pma from the us food and drug administration the fda before the company will be able to offer its products for tmr or ptmr on a commercial basis in the us a necessary prerequisite for submitting a pma application is completion of clinical testing to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company s tmr products 
on july   the company submitted a pma application to the fda for use of the eclipse laser system to treat patients with class iv angina chest pain caused by coronary artery disease using the tmr procedure 
the fda review process can be lengthy and its results are uncertain 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when the fda will approve this application 
on july  an fda panel recommended non approval of a pma application submitted by plc systems  inc  a major competitor of the company 
the company believes that this decision may have a significant impact on the fda s review and approval of the company s application 
subsequently  the fda requested twelve month follow up data on all tmr applications in addition to the six month data previously provided 
although the company has accumulated this data and is currently preparing it for submission to the fda  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience similar or other issues with the fda which could have a material adverse impact on its business and operating results 
completion of the company s clinical studies on a timely basis will depend  among other things  on the company s ability to successfully establish tmr and ptmr sites and continue to identify and enroll participating patients in a timely fashion 
in addition  the clinical studies will require substantial financial and management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the resources necessary to complete such clinical studies 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s clinical studies will be completed within the currently anticipated time frame or otherwise in a timely manner  nor that such clinical studies will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company s products to the extent necessary to obtain fda and other regulatory approvals and establish a commercial market for the company s products 
moreover  results of the initial clinical testing are not necessarily predictive of results to be achieved in later clinical studies  if undertaken  or commercially  if a pma is obtained 
failure to complete the company s clinical studies in a timely manner or to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company s tmr or ptmr products could delay or prevent regulatory approval and would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
no assurance of fda or other required governmental approvals the company s products are regulated in the us as medical devices by the fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fd c act and  as such  require fda approval of a pma application prior to commercial sale in the us the fda approves pma applications for specific indications only and fda regulation prohibits commercial marketing in the us of devices for indications that have not been approved by the fda 
the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities is lengthy  expensive and inherently uncertain  generally takes several years or longer to complete  if approval is obtained at all  and requires the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda 
on july   the company submitted a pma application to the fda for use of the eclipse laser system to treat patients with class iv angina chest pain caused by coronary artery disease using the tmr procedure 
there can be no assurance that the fda will approve this application in the foreseeable future if at all 
on july  an fda panel recommended non approval of a pma application submitted by plc systems  inc this decision may have an impact on the fda s review and approval of the company s application 
failure to obtain fda approval on a timely basis or for the indications sought by the company would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company will also be required to follow applicable good manufacturing practices gmp regulations of the fda  which include testing  control and documentation requirements  as well as similar requirements in other countries  including international standards organization iso standards 
although the company became certified in may  failure to meet or to continue to satisfy these requirements in the future would preclude the company from marketing its products on a commercial basis  and therefore would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
sales of medical devices outside of the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely by country 
in addition  the fda must approve the export of devices that require a pma but are not yet approved domestically 
foreign and domestic regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
in addition  to obtain such approvals  medical device manufacturers must comply with numerous other requirements of the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities 
for example  the european conforming mark the ce mark is required to sell products in european union countries 
the company received ce marking for its tmr laser in december however  product approvals can be withdrawn due to various factors  including failure to comply with regulatory standards or unforeseen problems following initial marketing 
risks associated with new surgical procedures  no assurance of market acceptance the company s ability to successfully commercialize its tmr and ptmr products will depend upon its ability to achieve acceptance of its products and procedures among cardiologists  cardiac surgeons and other members of the medical community as well as prospective patients 
the company believes that it will not achieve such acceptance until such time  if any  as the company s tmr or ptmr products can be demonstrated to be safe  efficacious and cost effective 
even if the clinical safety and effectiveness of the company s tmr products is established  cardiologists  cardiac surgeons and other members of the medical community may elect not to recommend tmr or ptmr for any number of other reasons 
broad use of the company s products will require training of numerous physicians  and the time required to complete such training could adversely affect market acceptance 
moreover  even if tmr and ptmr become generally accepted by the medical community  physicians trained in competitive products may elect not to consider the company s products  or may elect instead to recommend a competitor s products 
failure of the company s products to achieve significant market acceptance would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on single product line the company has elected to focus its resources on the continued development and refinement of its tmr and ptmr products 
if the company is unable to obtain requisite regulatory approvals or to achieve commercial acceptance of these products  the company s business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected  which could result in cessation of the company s business 
uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology  risks of future litigation the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products  preserve its trade secrets  and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the company s policy is to seek to protect its proprietary position by  among other methods  filing us and foreign patent applications related to its technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of its business 
although the company has a number of patents and patent applications pending relating to various aspects of tmr  ptmr and other cardiovascular therapies  there can be no assurance that any of the company s patents or patent applications will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future or that the rights granted thereunder will provide a competitive advantage 
the company intends to vigorously protect and defend its intellectual property 
it is uncertain whether patent protection will continue to be available for surgical methods in the future 
costly and time consuming litigation brought by the company may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
the company typically requires its employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements in connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationships with the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will not be breached or that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology  or that the company can meaningfully protect its rights in unpatented proprietary technology 
the medical device industry in general  and the industry segment that includes products for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in particular  have been characterized by substantial competition and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in this regard  competitors of the company have been issued a number of patents related to tmr 
in september  the company received from a competitor a notice of potential infringement of the competitor s patent regarding a method for tmr utilizing synchronization of laser pulses to the electrical signals from the heart 
in january  the company received from a second competitor a notice of potential infringement of the competitor s patent regarding a method to perform tmr using fiber optics 
the company has concluded in each case  following discussion with its patent counsel  that it does not utilize the process and or apparatus which is the subject of the patent at issue  and has responded to the respective competitor to such effect 
the company has received no further correspondence on either matter 
there can be no assurance  however  that further claims or proceedings will not be initiated by either competitor  or that claims by other parties will not arise in the future 
any such claims in the future  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to respond to and could divert the attention of the company s technical and management personnel 
the company may be involved in litigation to defend against claims of infringement by the company  to enforce patents issued to the company  or to protect trade secrets of the company 
if any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable in any litigation or administrative proceeding  the company could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each such patent or to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries and the filing of related patent applications 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that current and potential competitors and other third parties have not filed or in the future will not file applications for  or have not received or in the future will not receive  patents or obtain additional proprietary rights that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make  use or sell its products either in the us or internationally 
in the event the company were to require licenses to patents issued to third parties  there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be available on terms acceptable to the company  or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
expectation of intense market competition the company expects that the markets for tmr and ptmr  which are currently in the early stages of development  will be intensely competitive 
competitors are likely to include at least four laser companies plc systems  inc plc  cardiogenesis corporation cardiogenesis  us surgical corporation us surgical  and johnson johnson j j all four of which are currently selling tmr and or ptmr products for investigational use in the us and abroad 
other competitors may include additional companies that elect to enter the market  including large companies in the laser  cardiac devices and cardiac surgery markets 
the company believes that a number of significant companies including boston scientific corp  baxter international  inc  and cr bard  inc 
have distribution rights to current or future products in tmr or ptmr 
many of these companies have significantly greater financial  development  marketing and other resources than the company 
in the event a competitor is able to obtain a pma for its products prior to the company  the company s ability to compete successfully could be materially and adversely affected 
tmr and ptmr also compete with other more conventional or established methods for the treatment of cardiovascular disease  including drug therapy  ptca and cabg 
although the company is seeking to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company s tmr and ptmr procedures in patients for whom other cardiovascular treatments are not likely to provide relief  and in the future intends to pursue the safety and effectiveness of tmr or ptmr when used in conjunction with other treatments  there can be no assurance that the company s products will be accepted in these markets  nor can there be any assurance that physicians will use the company s procedures to replace or supplement established treatments  or that the company s procedures will be competitive with current or future technologies 
in such event  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
any product developed by the company that gains regulatory approval will face competition for market acceptance and market share 
an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
accordingly  the relative pace at which the company is able to develop products  complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes  gain third party reimbursement acceptance and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are expected to be important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
history of operating losses from inception to december   the company incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
the company s revenues and operating income will continue to be constrained until such time  if ever  as fda and other regulatory approval is obtained for the company s products  and for an indefinite period of time after any such approval is obtained 
furthermore  the company expects its expenses in all categories to increase as its clinical trial and other business activities expand 
hence  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
failure to achieve significant commercial revenues or profitability would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of technological change significant resources are continually being expended to develop new and improved treatment methodologies for coronary disease 
accordingly  the market acceptance and commercial success of the company s tmr and ptmr products and procedures will depend not only on the safety and effectiveness of the company s tmr and ptmr products and procedures  but also the relative safety and effectiveness of alternative treatment measures 
any such alternatives could potentially include new treatments or improvements to treatments which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential difficulties in managing business undergoing rapid change the company s future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
in this regard  a number of members of the company s senior management team have only recently joined the company 
moreover  certain members of such management team have limited experience as a senior executive of a public corporation 
there can be no assurance that the management team will operate together effectively 
to compete successfully against current and future competitors  complete clinical trials in progress  prepare additional products for clinical trials and develop future products  the company believes that it must continue to expand its operations  particularly in the areas of research and development  sales and marketing  training  and manufacturing 
if the company were to experience significant growth in the future  such growth would likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain upon the company s management  operating and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate such growth and compete effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
there can be no assurance that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s future operations 
any failure to implement and improve the company s operational  financial and management systems or to expand  train  motivate or manage employees could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential fluctuations in operating results results of operations are expected to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon numerous factors  including the timing and results of clinical trials  delays associated with the fda and other regulatory approval processes  health care reform and reimbursement policies  demand for the company s products  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  the number  timing and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of the company s products on a timely basis  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new or enhanced products offered by the company or its competitors  product quality problems  personnel changes  changes in company strategy  and the level of international sales 
quarter to quarter operating results could also be affected by the timing of the receipt of individual customer orders  order fulfillment and revenue recognition with respect to small numbers of individual laser base units  since each such product carries a high price per unit 
uncertainty regarding third party reimbursement the company expects that its ability to successfully commercialize its products will depend significantly on the availability of reimbursement for surgical procedures using the company s products from third party payors such as governmental programs  private insurance and private health plans 
reimbursement is a significant factor considered by hospitals in determining whether to acquire new equipment 
notwithstanding fda approval  if granted  third party payors may deny reimbursement if the payor determines that a therapeutic medical device is unnecessary  inappropriate  not cost effective or experimental or is used for a non approved indication 
medicare reimburses hospitals on a prospectively determined fixed amount for the costs associated with an in patient hospitalization based on the patient s discharge diagnosis  and reimburses physicians on a prospectively determined fixed amount based on the procedure performed  regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
medicare and other third party payors are increasingly scrutinizing whether to cover new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
in addition  medicare traditionally has considered items or services involving devices that have not been approved or cleared for marketing by the fda to be precluded from medicare coverage 
under a hcfa policy effective november   medicare coverage will not be precluded for items and related services involving devices that have been classified by the fda as non experimental investigational category b devices and that are furnished in accordance with fda approved protocols governing clinical trials 
even with items or services involving category b devices  however  medicare coverage may be denied if other coverage requirements are not met  for example if the treatment is not medically needed for the specific patient 
in november  the company received category b designation for its tmr procedure from the hcfa 
accordingly  the company s procedures had received third party reimbursement in many cases under hcfa s policy 
as of may   although category b status is retained  under a recent hcfa ruling  there will not be coverage for any manufacturer s tmr procedures at this time 
there can be no assurance that this coverage will be given in the future or that medicare will adequately reimburse the costs of the company s tmr and ptmr procedures when and if a pma is granted 
while the company is unable to determine the ultimate effect of this policy change on the business and operating results  the company anticipates that research and development expenses will increase significantly due to increased expenses in support of clinical trials  and revenues from sale of investigational products are likely to decrease  at least over the short term and possibly thereafter 
there can be no assurance as to whether third party payors will cover tmr or ptmr procedures or as to the levels of reimbursement 
there also can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement  if any  will not be decreased in the future  or that future legislation  regulation  or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for the company s products or its ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
fundamental reforms in the healthcare industry in the us and europe that could affect the availability of third party reimbursement continue to be proposed  and the company cannot predict the timing or effect of any such proposal 
if third party payor coverage or reimbursement is unavailable or inadequate  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
limited sales  marketing and distribution systems the company has made limited sales of its tmr products to date  for investigational use only 
accordingly  the company has maintained a limited sales and marketing organization in the us and abroad 
the company plans to market its tmr and ptmr products  if approved  through a direct sales force and through relationships with distributors or agents 
establishment of a sales force capable of effectively commercializing the company s tmr and ptmr products will require substantial efforts and require significant management and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish such a sales capability on a timely basis  if at all 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s distributors will devote sufficient resources to development of the markets for the company s products or that they will be successful in such commercialization efforts 
potential need for additional capital although the company anticipates that its current cash balances  together with sales of products for investigational use  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through at least  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional sources of cash at an earlier date 
this will depend upon the progress of expansion of the company s clinical trials and any need for additional trials or other testing of the company s products  and the timing of required expenditures 
if the company is required to obtain additional financing in the future  there can be no assurance that capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
risk of product liability the company faces an inherent and significant business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products results in personal injury or death  and there can be no assurance that material product liability claims will not be assessed against the company in the future 
the company maintains insurance against product liability claims in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
however  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available in the amount desired or on terms acceptable to the company  or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
also  in the event that any of the company s products prove to be defective  the company may be required to recall or redesign such products 
any uninsured or underinsured claim brought against the company or any claim or product recall that results in significant cost to or adverse publicity against the company could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited manufacturing experience  dependence on key suppliers the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in a timely  cost effective manner and in compliance with gmp  iso and other regulatory requirements 
the manufacture of the company s products is a labor intensive  complex operation involving a number of separate processes and components 
the company s manufacturing activities to date have consisted primarily of manufacturing limited quantities of systems for use in clinical trials 
the company does not have experience in manufacturing its products in the commercial quantities that might be required if the company receives regulatory approval for its tmr and ptmr products 
furthermore  as a condition to receipt of pma approval  the company s facilities  procedures and practices will be subject to pre approval and ongoing gmp inspections by fda 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of new products  including problems involving product yields  quality control and assurance  component and service availability  adequacy of control policies and procedures  lack of qualified personnel  compliance with fda regulations  and the need for further fda approval of new manufacturing processes and facilities 
there can be no assurance that manufacturing yields  costs or quality will not be adversely affected as the company seeks to increase production  and any such adverse effect could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company currently purchases certain laser and fiber optic components from single sources 
although the company has identified alternative vendors  the qualification of additional or replacement vendors for certain components or services is a lengthy process 
there can be no assurance that materials obtained from outside suppliers will continue to be available in adequate quantities or at the times required by the company or that the company will be able to locate alternative suppliers on a timely basis 
any significant supply interruption would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products and  therefore  would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects to manufacture its products based on forecasted product orders  and intends to purchase subassemblies and components prior to receipt of purchase orders from customers 
lead times for materials and components ordered by the company vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the business practices of the specific supplier  contract terms and general demand for a component at a given time 
as a result  there is a risk of excess or inadequate inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
dependence on key personnel the company s future business and operating results depend in significant part aggregate or for each upon the continued contributions of its key technical and senior management personnel  including douglas murphy chutorian  md  the company s chief executive officer  and richard l 
mueller  jr  the company s president and chief operating officer 
the company maintains key person life insurance policies on both of these individuals in the amount of million 
the company s future business and operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified additional management  manufacturing  technical  marketing and sales and support personnel for its operations 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
in this regard  the chief financial officer and vice president of quality assurance  have agreed to remain with the company until suitable replacements have been hired 
although the company has initiated a search for these positions  there can be no assurance that suitable replacements can be identified and successfully recruited in a timely fashion 
the loss of any key employee  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or the company s inability to attract and retain skilled employees  as needed  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trading market for common stock  volatility of stock price the market price of the common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  conditions and trends in the medical device and other technology industries  healthcare reform measures  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the medical device industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general market conditions and other factors
