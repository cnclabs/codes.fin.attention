sales sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
the company expects that comparable store sales increases for fiscal year will be lower than for fiscal year the company believes that current comparable store sales increases have been greater than historical averages due to such factors as increasing sales in stores acquired from fresh fields  the comparison of sales from stores located in southern california which were negatively impacted in the prior year by the name change from mrs 
gooch s to whole foods market  improvements in overall store execution and increased sales of newly released private label products 
comparable store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts  reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market 
additionally  net sales by amrion increased over the prior year by   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales increases by amrion resulted from improved customer acquisition programs and expanded retail and mass market distribution programs 
the company believes that historical sales trends may not necessarily be indicative of future results of operations 
gross profit gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs  plus contribution from non retail grocery distribution and food preparation operations 
the company s consolidated gross profit in fiscal year increased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal year and from in fiscal year these increases reflect increased national buying and private label initiatives which continue to lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis  and continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement and merchandising and controlling spoilage 
in all years  gross profit margins were positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature 
relative to other stores in a region  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting lower spoilage as volumes increase  as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
additionally  gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in departments such as prepared foods where the company achieves higher gross profits 
gross profits were also positively affected for all years by reductions in product cost as a percentage of sales at amrion  offset by a slight increase in indirect costs in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal year and in fiscal year these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales reflect reductions in store labor costs and increases in store sales without comparable increases in administrative staff 
these decreases were offset by increased market development costs and increased administrative staff at amrion 
whole foods market has historically been able to expand without a significant increase in general and administrative costs 
however  in certain circumstances the company has increased the number of administrative and support personnel at the regional and national levels in connection with the implementation of new management information systems and to support current and planned growth

pre opening costs include hiring and training personnel  supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings and are expensed in the quarter of the opening 
pre opening costs are generally higher in locations which are some distance from an existing base of operations due to higher training  travel and moving costs

additionally  fiscal expenses include losses on the disposition of store assets  remaining rent and lease termination costs recognized pursuant to a plan initiated at the time of the fresh fields acquisition to close or relocate duplicate stores 
at september  and september   the company had remaining merger related liabilities related to the fresh fields acquisition totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
these liabilities were reduced primarily as a result of cash payments for rent and lease termination costs 
the company does not expect the ultimate payment of these liabilities to materially affect its liquidity

income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively  and a credit of in fiscal the income tax rate for fiscal reflects the elimination of the approximately million valuation allowance previously provided on net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the fresh fields merger 
as of september   the company had remaining net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to net operating losses incurred by fresh fields from its inception until the fiscal acquisition by whole foods market which are available to offset certain future taxable income 
the fiscal effective tax rate reflects a pre tax loss of million and the non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of certain merger transaction costs that were expensed for financial accounting and reporting purposes in that year 
the company expects its effective tax rate for fiscal will be higher than its effective rate for fiscal as of september   the company considers it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized

quarterly results the first quarter consists of weeks  the second and third quarters each consist of weeks and the fourth quarter consists of or weeks 
fiscal year and are week years with the fourth quarters consisting of weeks 
because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters and contains both the thanksgiving and christmas holidays  it typically represents a larger share of the company s annual sales from existing stores 
quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations may be materially impacted by the number and timing of new store openings for which related costs are deferred as incurred and expensed in the quarter the store is opened

net cash flow from financing activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
whole foods market s principal capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and  to a lesser extent  the resultant increase in working capital requirements 
the company estimates that cash requirements to open a new store will range from million to million after giving effect to any landlord construction allowance 
this excludes new store inventory of approximately  a substantial portion of which is financed by the vendors of whole foods market 
in fiscal  whole foods market plans to open approximately nine new stores  relocate one existing store and will have under development additional stores that will open in fiscal the company will incur additional capital expenditures in fiscal in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at its existing stores  purchase and development of new production  distribution and office facilities for amrion and allegro and continued development of its management information systems

the company expects that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund planned store openings and other cash needs through the end of fiscal  absent any material cash acquisitions 
year issues during fiscal  the company established a project team to coordinate existing year activities and address remaining year issues 
the team has focused its efforts in three areas information systems is software and hardware  facilities and non is equipment with embedded systems  and third party relationships 
the company has adopted a five phase year plan consisting of phase i identification and ranking of the components of the company s systems  equipment  and suppliers that may be vulnerable to year problems  phase ii assessment of items identified in phase i  phase iii remediation or replacement of non compliant systems and components and determination of solutions for non compliant suppliers  phase iv testing and implementation of systems for which remediation is complete  and phase v development of contingency plans to mitigate the potential adverse effects on the company s operations of reasonably likely worst case year scenarios 
the company has completed phase i and plans to complete phase ii by january  phases iii and iv are underway concurrent with phases i and ii 
phase v will begin after phase ii is completed 
information systems software and hardware 
the company has assessed its primary information systems and remediation is in process for those systems that require remediation 
the company s planned testing completion and implementation dates for these systems are summarized below planned testing planned completion implementation date date point of sale northeast may  june  others december  april  store back office mid atlantic april  may  northeast may  june  s

the company has completed an inventory of all non is embedded systems 
assessment of these items is planned to be complete by january  plans are already in place to upgrade a variety of devices such as time clocks  scales  fax machines  and hvac controls 
the company plans to complete remediation  testing and implementation for all non is embedded systems by june  third party relationships 
the company has identified significant third parties upon whom it relies and has sent written requests for representation of their year readiness 
the company is reviewing responses received and will follow up on those not received 
the company will also be conducting discussions with its most significant vendors and suppliers to verify their year readiness and review their contingency plans 
costs to address the company s year issues 
the company estimates that the expense associated with the year plan will be approximately million  of which approximately  has been incurred to date 
additionally  the company estimates that hardware and software purchases totaling approximately million will be capitalized pursuant to the year plan 
risks and contingency plans 
the aforementioned costs and completion dates are based on plans for work to be performed and management s best estimates  which have been derived from assumptions about future events including the availability of certain resources and other factors 
the company believes that the year plan will address its year concerns 
however  if the company is unsuccessful in completing remediation of non compliant systems  if the costs to remediate the company s year issues significantly exceed current estimates  or if significant third parties upon whom the company relies cannot resolve their year issues  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
therefore  the company plans to develop by the end of july contingency plans to address risks that have been determined to be most likely based upon the results of assessment  testing and verification procedures 
there are numerous uncertainties related to year issues including uncertainties related to third parties upon whom the company relies  and at this time the company is unable to fully determine the consequences of year failures on its results of operations 
the company believes that the successful implementation of its year plan will mitigate the risk of a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations
