item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as is the norm in the apparel industry  the company engages in promotional activity with its customers which affect the company s sales  gross profit and gross profit margins 
norton accomplishes this by granting its customers sales allowances  while miss erika sells merchandise at promotional prices 
accordingly  the company s sales  gross profit and gross profit margins vary from fiscal quarter to quarter and fiscal year to year 
in addition  the company generally ships its products in accordance with normal apparel industry shipping cycles 
correspondingly  sales  gross profit and gross profit margins may be affected by the timing of shipping cycles or the delivery of finished goods 
this may result in shipments to customers occurring before or after a particular fiscal quarter end  thereby affecting both fiscal quarter to quarter comparisons and quarter to quarter results during a fiscal year 
the company contracts for the manufacture of all of its products and continues to increase the proportion of its products produced overseas 
contract manufacturing allows the company to avoid significant capital expenditures for manufacturing facilities and the fixed costs of maintaining a large production work force 
foreign contract manufacturing allows it to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs  thereby allowing it to reduce prices to its customers 
the company believes that foreign sourcing also allows the company to avail itself of a better equipped and more skilled labor force  thereby allowing it to produce a higher quality  better valued product for its customers 
the company offsets the longer lead time necessary for foreign sourced fabrics and manufacturing by early and timely attention to production planning 
the company s continuing focus on improving profitability has led the company to undertake certain initiatives to improve gross profit and gross profit margins 
these include the implementation of certain merchandising changes  as well as the closure of underperforming divisions 
in the merchandising area  the company has recently reduced the number of products ie reduced the number of sku s offered in any particular collection of its norton mcnaughton product line in an effort to minimize the number of unrelated items unsold at the end of a selling period 
the company has undertaken this initiative to reduce sales allowances required to compensate retailers for retail price reductions taken to sell unrelated clothing items 
in addition  by taking advantage of product sourcing opportunities  the company has been able to offer quality and fashionable products to retailers at lower price points in an effort to further enhance the sales of the company s products to retailers and to consumers and to further reduce sales allowances 
these initiatives have been undertaken without a change to quality of merchandise 
as a result of these initiatives  the company anticipates that revenue levels in fiscal  excluding miss erika  will decrease from those in fiscal the company continually monitors the success  in terms of sales  profitability and customer acceptance  of its product lines 
in the event that one or more of its product lines does not meet the company s expectations  the company will discontinue their production 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company began selling merchandise under its existing product lines to sears  including norton mcnaughton and norton studio 
correspondingly  the company discontinued the modiano product line  which had been produced exclusively for sears  in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company will discontinue the lauren alexandra private label product line produced for federated department stores and the catalog division in the first quarter of fiscal  and the pant her private label product line produced for the may department stores company in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company decided to close its retail outlet stores due to this division s inability to meet the company s profitability targets 
the company utilized these retail outlets to liquidate excess inventory  including end of stock  out of season and other miscellaneous merchandise 
due to the company s new merchandising strategy  the company believes that it will reduce its need to liquidate excess inventory 
to the extent that the company is required to dispose of excess merchandise in the future  the company believes that it can do so on a more cost effective basis through discounters and other retailers 
in fiscal  the aforementioned discontinued divisions contributed approximately million to net sales and experienced approximately breakeven operating results 
the company recorded special charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million in connection with the closure of these divisions 
the company implemented several other significant initiatives in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company appointed a new president and chief operating officer  and the company s former president and a consultant terminated their relationship with the company 
in addition  the company terminated certain lease obligations  and made the determination to close its retail outlet stores  as discussed above 
in connection with these changes  the company recorded special charges of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in an effort to further streamline operations and in conjunction with the company s decision to discontinue the various divisions discussed earlier  the company reduced its workforce by approximately 
other cost savings measures implemented included merchandising changes  which will enable the company to produce fewer samples  and reductions in executive compensation and ancillary expenses 
as a result of these initiatives and those undertaken in the second quarter  the company anticipates that it without taking miss erika into account may achieve cost savings of up to million in fiscal  although savings as a result of workforce reductions will be offset by any new hires above the company s plan 
this management s discussion and analysis and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking information about the company s anticipated operating results  including following the acquisition of miss erika 
the company s ability to achieve its projected results is dependent on many factors which are outside of management s control 
some of the most significant factors would be a further deterioration in retailing conditions for women s apparel  a further increase in price pressures and other competitive factors  any of which could result in an unanticipated decrease in gross profit margins  an unanticipated need to hire additional personnel above the company s plan  unanticipated problems arising with miss erika s business or the integration of miss erika s business with that of the company  the unanticipated loss of a major customer  the unanticipated loss of a major contractor or supplier  and weather conditions which could impact retail traffic and the company s ability to ship on a timely basis 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company  including following the acquisition of miss erika  will achieve its anticipated operating results
