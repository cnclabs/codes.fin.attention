item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this document contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of a number of important factors 
for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the risk factors set forth below in factors affecting the company s business  in the financial line item discussions below and elsewhere in this document 
overview 
national instruments corporation engages in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of instrumentation software and specialty interface cards for general commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
the company offers hundreds of products used to create virtual instrumentation systems 
the company has identified two major markets for its products test and measurement and industrial automation 
many of the company s products may be used in either environment  and consequently  specific application of the company s products is determined by the end customer and often is not known to the company at the time of sale 
the company approaches both markets with essentially the same products which are used in a variety of applications from research and development to production testing and industrial control 
the company sells to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company s revenues have grown every year since and the company has been profitable in every year since there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will continue to grow or that the company will remain profitable in future periods 
as a result  the company believes historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales north america europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense net foreign exchange loss gain income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales 
in  a continued increase in demand for the company s existing and new products generated a increase over in net sales which follows a increase from to this year marks the fourteenth consecutive year of annual sales growth of or more 
the increase in sales in these periods is primarily attributable to the introduction of new and upgraded products in each period  increased market acceptance of the company s products  and an expanded customer base 
the growth in sales over is attributed to the synergy of focusing the domestic and international efforts on the company s main products and on increasing the number of tradeshows and customer seminars 
in constant dollars  net sales increased   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the relatively higher constant dollar growth rate in is attributed to successful new product introductions 
the decrease in the us dollar annual growth rate  compared to in  is the result of the strengthening us dollar as discussed further in this document 
north american revenue was million in  an increase of from  following a increase in over the increase in the north american revenue growth is attributed to new product sales as the direct result of the company s investment in research and development 
european revenue was million  an increase of over  following a increase in from asia pacific revenue grew to million  following a increase in over levels 
international sales sales to customers outside of north america accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the asia pacific revenue growth rate  in us dollars  during is attributed to the weakening of the japanese yen  korean won and other asian currencies 
see the discussion below for more information concerning the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales growth 
the growth in in the asia pacific region was driven by increased customer acceptance of localized japanese products and local support and increased penetration in the other asian countries 
the company intends to continue to expand its international operations by increasing market presence in existing markets  and continuing to use distributors to sell its products in countries in which the sales volume does not justify direct sales activities 
although international sales as a percent of total sales decreased in us dollars  the company has determined that this is the effect of the strengthening dollar and anticipates that sales outside of north america will continue to represent a significant and possibly increasing portion of its revenues 
the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in and  and they could continue to do so 
in december  the company expanded its foreign currency hedging program to include both foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see foreign exchange gain loss below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated net sales for would have been million representing an increase of million  which represents consolidated sales growth 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million  or 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the comparable sales growth factor would have been growth in over the preceding proforma amounts and percentages are presented for comparison purposes 
if the current trend in exchange rates continue throughout  it will have the effect of lowering the us dollar equivalent of international sales and operating expenses 
gross profit 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit represented   and in   and  respectively 
the relatively high software content of the company s products is demonstrated in the gross margins achieved by the company 
the relatively higher margin in is the result of reduced direct material costs used in production and the favorable leveraging of our production overhead expenses against the increase in sales 
the lower margin in can be attributed to increased software duplication outsourcing costs and inventory reductions 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain the historical margin 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company believes its current manufacturing capacity is adequate to meet current needs 
the company plans to add  if sales dictate  a third production line in there can be no assurances that a delay in the implementation of the third line would not have a material impact on revenues and results of operations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense in increased from  which followed an increase of in from the increase in the expense in absolute amounts during and is primarily attributable to programs to increase the company s international presence in both the european and asia pacific markets  increases in sales and marketing personnel both internationally and in north america  increased marketing for new products and a worldwide seminar series 
sales and marketing personnel increased by during from at december  to at december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue remained steady at of revenue during following a decline in to from in in  the company benefited from reduced promotional costs as a result of converting to more electronic media such as the company s world wide web server accessed through the internet and an interactive cd rom application  instrupedia tm  and more cost effective demonstration disks 
the company expects sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on initial marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expense as reported in increased compared to following an increase of in over when adjusted for the acquisition of the products  technology  and assets of nulogic during and the acquisition of georgetown systems  inc and another software acquisition during  research and development expense grew in following a increase in over see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s acquisitions 
the increase in research and development expenditures excluding the acquisition related charges in and in absolute amounts and as a percentage of sales in each period was primarily due to the hiring of additional product development engineers 
research and development personnel increased from at december  to at december  the company believes that a significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive and continue revenue growth 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company amortizes such costs over the related product s estimated economic life  generally three years  beginning when a product becomes available for general release 
amortization expense totaled million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization expense is due primarily to amortization of  of development costs capitalized as a result of a imaging acquisition software purchase 
software development costs capitalized during such years were million  million and  respectively 
the significant items capitalized in include daq  labview  labwindows cvi cvi and purchased software development costs related to the nulogic acquisition 
the levels of capitalization in prior years are primarily a result of completing significant upgrade projects for labview  labwindows cvi cvi  bridgeview and purchased software development costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense in increased from  which followed an increase of in from the increased spending in absolute dollars in was primarily due to the increase in information systems personnel  costs to train personnel  the use of outside consultants  and costs to implement the new management information system in japan 
the increased spending in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to the increased sales volume and the related supporting activities and also due to the costs of supporting the company s management information systems in north america and europe 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue declined to of revenue during this decline is attributable to the efficiencies in north america and europe achieved primarily as a result of the implementation of the new management information system 
the company expects that general and administrative expense in future periods will increase in absolute amounts and will fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
interest income and expense 
interest income in increased from  which followed an increase of in from the primary source of interest income is from the investment of proceeds from the company s issuance of common stock under an initial public offering in march and cash flow generated from operations 
during  interest income continued to increase due to the investment of cash generated from operations 
interest expense decreased from  which followed a decrease of in from interest expense represents less than one percent of net sales and fluctuates as a result of bank borrowings and interest terms thereon 
the large decrease in interest expense from to is attributed to repayments of the equipment loan and the millennium loan during january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s debt 
foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange losses of million during  compared to losses of  in and gains of  in these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s sales subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
the loss in is attributable to the strengthening of the us dollar 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts against a majority of its foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company typically limits the duration of its foreign exchange forward contracts to days 
in december  the company expanded its foreign currency hedging program to also include foreign currency option contracts in order to reduce its exposure of future net foreign currency cash flows 
the company s policy allows for the purchase of out of the money foreign currency option contracts for up to of its risk and limits the duration of these contracts to months 
as a result  the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
if the strengthening of the us dollar that occurred throughout continues in  the company will continue to experience significant foreign exchange losses due to the foreign exchange risks that are not addressed by the company s hedging strategy 
the company does not currently invest in contracts for speculative purposes nor does it intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward and option contracts and hedged positions 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in and and in the decrease in the effective tax rate from to resulted from a change in the mix of income among taxing jurisdictions and utilization of tax credits for taxes paid in higher tax rate jurisdictions 
at december   six of the company s subsidiaries had available  for income tax purposes  foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million of which  expire between and the remaining  of loss carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in the related tax jurisdictions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
historically  the company financed its capital expenditures  such as the new manufacturing facility constructed in  through borrowings from financial institutions 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december  accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of higher sales levels 
receivable days outstanding of days at december  represent an improvement over days outstanding at december  consolidated inventory balances have increased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns of per year represent an improvement over turns of per year at december  and reflect improvements in inventory management occurring at the company s manufacturing facility in austin  texas as well as at the centralized european warehouse in amsterdam 
cash used for investing activities in includes million for the purchase of property and equipment  including construction in process  capitalization of software development costs of million  net short term investment purchases of million and acquisition costs of million for the purchase of nulogic during the company expects to complete an office building located next to its manufacturing facility in austin  texas in the summer of the company estimates the total cost for the new building  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  will range from million to million 
the company has incurred approximately million in construction costs as of december  with the remainder becoming payable in the first half of the remaining portion of the construction costs and costs of furniture  fixtures and equipment will be paid out of existing working capital and future cash flows 
upon completion of the new building the company anticipates additional quarterly operating expenses of million 
the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances  internally generated funds  and financing arrangements with its current financial institutions 
the company has a million credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na which consists of i an million revolving line of credit  and ii an million manufacturing facility loan 
as of december   the company had no outstanding balance on the line of credit and a balance of million on the manufacturing facility loan 
the revolving line of credit expires on june  the company s credit agreements contain certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters  including the bank s prior approval of significant mergers and acquisitions 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s borrowing activity 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments and credit available under the company s existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
factors affecting the company s business fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates like the recent devaluation in certain asian currencies  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
specifically  if the asian currencies continue to weaken against the us dollar  and if the local sales prices cannot be raised  the company will experience a deterioration of its asian profit margin 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company serves a number of industries such as semiconductors  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in recent years  the company s revenues have been characterized by seasonality  with revenues typically being relatively constant in the first  second and third quarters  growing in the fourth quarter and being relatively flat or declining from the fourth quarter of the year to the first quarter of the following year 
if this historical pattern continues  revenues for the first quarter of may not exceed revenues from the fourth quarter of the company s results of operations in the third quarter of may be adversely affected by lower sales levels in europe which typically occur during the summer months 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenue results from the international mix of its revenue and the variability of the budgeting and purchasing cycles of its customers throughout each international region 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with the company s efforts to increase foreign market penetration 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is hewlett packard company hp  which has been the leading supplier of traditional instrumentation solutions for decades 
although hp offers its own line of proprietary instrument controllers  hp also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
hp is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of hp s strong position in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information systems 
during  the company completed its implementation of new management information systems in europe and japan 
as with any new management information system  unforeseen post implementation issues may arise that could affect management s ability to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions 
furthermore  it is possible that one or more of the company s three regional information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown 
if this shutdown occurred near the end of a quarter it could impact the company s product shipments and revenues as product distribution is heavily dependent on the integrated management information systems in each region 
accordingly  operating results in that quarter would be adversely impacted due to the shipments which would not occur until the following period 
the company is working to achieve reliable regional management information systems to control costs and improve the ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
for further information related to the management information system see the discussion of the impact of year included in this document 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the regulatory environment in some emerging countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the us dollar 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated net sales for would have been million representing an increase of million  which represents consolidated sales growth 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million  or 
if the strengthening of the us dollar continues in the future  it could have a materially adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company s manufacturing processes use large volumes of high quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources 
several of these components are available through sole or limited sources 
sole source components purchased by the company include application specific integration circuits asics and other components 
the company has in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with sole source components  and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future 
accordingly  the failure to receive sole source components from suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on revenues and results of operations 
proprietary rights and intellectual property litigation 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in its principal products 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of the company s intellectual property rights 
as is typical in the industry  the company from time to time may be notified that it is infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others 
while no actions are currently pending by or against the company  there can be no assurance that litigation will not be initiated in the future which may cause significant litigation expense  liability and a diversion of management s attention which may have a material adverse affect on results of operations 
dependence on key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  marketing  research and development and operational personnel including dr 
truchard  mr 
kodosky and other members of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company has no agreements providing for the employment of any of its key employees for any fixed term and the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees in the future could have a material adverse affect on operating results 
the company also believes its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management  technical  marketing  research and development  product development and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies as well as training  motivating and supervising the employees 
in addition  the recruiting environment for engineering and other technical professionals is very competitive 
competition for qualified software engineers is particularly intense 
the company also recruits and employs foreign nationals to achieve its hiring goals primarily for entry level engineering and software positions 
there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to be able to recruit foreign nationals to the current degree if government requirements for temporary and permanent residence becomes increasingly restrictive 
these factors further intensify competition for key personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel or attracting and retaining additional key personnel 
risk of product liability claims 
the company s products are designed in part to provide information upon which the users may rely 
the company attempts to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in its products  and to limit its product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability  including disclaimers in its shrink wrap license agreements with end users 
if future products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely  customer acceptance of the company s products could be adversely affected 
further  the company could be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
although the company maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual provisions used by the company to limit its liability will be sufficient 
impact of year many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
based on a recent assessment  the company believes that its products are year compliant 
while the company is not currently aware of any year compliance issues with its products  no assurances can be made that problems will not arise such as customer problems with other software programs  operating systems or hardware that disrupt their use of the company s products 
there can be no assurances that such disruption would not negatively impact costs and revenues in future years 
the company has been assured by oracle corporation that all of the company s oracle based management information systems  which include the manufacturing  distribution  finance  and order entry systems  are year compliant with the exception of the management information system in japan 
the company expects to upgrade the japanese system during the company plans to begin internal year testing of the major management information systems during as well as assess any additional year issues worldwide 
the company is aware that the current customer marketing database and customer support software are not year compliant 
however  the company expects to upgrade both systems prior to year as part of on going system upgrades 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
it is not anticipated that there will be a significant increase in costs as much of the year activities will be a continuation of the on going process to improve all the company s systems 
the company plans to complete the year project by mid however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
specific factors that might cause a material impact include  but are not limited to  availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  failure by third parties to timely convert their systems  and similar uncertainties
