liquidity and capital resources the company relies on cash generated by operations and borrowings under its credit facility to finance its operations 
the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended june   and were as follows item continued year ended june  in thousands net cash used provided by operating activities    net cash used by investing activities net cash used provided by financing activities   cash used by operations decreased by million from million used in fiscal year to million used in fiscal year principally as the result of increased film amortization of million  a decrease in the change in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in additions to film costs of million  and an increase in the change in minimum guarantees and royalties payable of million  which were partially offset by a decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the company invested million in film inventory 
the additions were primarily related to the theatrical wide release of eve s bayou and star kid and to produce and acquire new films 
the company anticipates a reduction in the level of investment in film inventory in fiscal resulting from its decision not to release any wide theatrical films in fiscal two principal factors have increased the length of time from investment in film costs to recoupment  which has increased the company s cash requirements 
the first factor is the terms of the company s current credit facility entered into in december under the current credit facility  described below  the company directly pays production costs that generally were previously paid by off balance sheet production company financing 
this change in financing has accelerated certain film acquisition payments that were previously made at the time of film delivery and are now made periodically throughout the production process 
the production process often takes from nine months to a year or more 
commitments to purchase films from production companies upon delivery are included in contingent contractual obligations 
the second factor that has increased the length of time from investment in film costs to recoupment is increased theatrical distribution activity 
theatrical films generally require significant marketing expenditures for prints and advertising which are capitalized as film costs 
theatrical marketing campaigns begin well in advance of the theatrical release to generate the maximum level of awareness for the film 
the opening item continued date must be carefully selected and is often changed to address competition  screen availability and other factors 
in addition  the decision to release a film theatrically is often not made until a theatrical test is conducted which can take several months 
the home video release and other ancillary market revenues are also not realized for several months to years after the theatrical release 
for further information see results of operations 
investing activities for the years ended june   and have primarily consisted of expenditures on equipment and leasehold improvements related to the expansion of theatrical operations 
financing activities  consisting primarily of activity under the company s credit facility  were a small use of cash in fiscal   and a large source of cash in fiscal  million 
borrowings under the credit facility in fiscal were primarily the result of motion picture production  acquisition and distribution expenditures exceeding operating cash inflows due primarily to the company s focus on theatrical distribution which began in fiscal the company s cash requirements vary in part with the size and timing of production advances and minimum guarantee payments along with the timing of its theatrical  home video  television and international releases 
in the years ended june   and the principal sources of funds have been provided by the company s credit facility and available cash 
the company s principal operating subsidiaries  trimark pictures  inc and trimark television  inc  on december  entered into a million revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks agented and arranged by the chase manhattan bank which replaced a million revolving credit facility with bank of america nt sa and westdeustche landesbank 
the credit facility expires december  under the credit agreement  the company may borrow for various corporate purposes provided that the aggregate borrowings do not exceed the borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which is derived from specified percentages of approved accounts receivable and film library 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by the company and certain of its subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its significant subsidiaries 
loans outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of above chase manhattan s prime rate or above the london interbank offered rate for eurodollars for the loan term specified 
an unused commitment fee is payable on the average unused item continued availability under the credit facility  at the rate of per annum 
as of june  there was million outstanding under the credit facility 
the company expects to use excess cash flow generated by theatrical and library product to decrease current borrowing levels 
the credit agreement contains various financial and other covenants to which the company must adhere 
these covenants  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum net worth and various financial ratios which are reported to the bank on a quarterly basis and include limitations on additional indebtedness  liens  investments  disposition of assets  guarantees  affiliate transactions and the use of proceeds 
as previously reported  at december   the company was out of compliance with certain financial covenants primarily as a result of the non cash write downs of star kid and chairman of the board to net realizable value 
in march the company obtained a waiver and amendment  including additional covenants  to its credit agreement  which brought the company into compliance with all financial covenants 
the company is currently in compliance with all debt covenants as of june  and believes that its existing capital  funds from operations  and other available sources of capital including funds obtained through pre sales and gap financing will be sufficient to enable the company to fund its presently planned productions  acquisitions  distribution and overhead expenditures for the next twelve months as well as meet all debt covenants provided for in the amended credit agreement 
in the event that the motion pictures released or distributed by the company during such period do not meet with sufficiently positive distributor and audience response  sales and licensing of distribution rights to films in the company s film library and films which the company plans to release during such period are less than anticipated or the company is not able to exploit various sources of capital such as pre sales and gap financing to the extent anticipated  the company will likely need to significantly reduce its currently planned level of productions  acquisitions  distribution activities and overhead as described below and will likely need to obtain additional sources of capital 
the company is currently exploring obtaining additional sources of capital including equity and debt financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such additional capital will be available or available on terms advantageous to the company

the company is currently authorized to spend up to  in fiscal to purchase shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise 
impact of year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of time sensitive information by its computerized information systems 
year issues may arise if computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in such case  programs that have time sensitive logic may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
management is in the process of completing a review of significant software and equipment used in the company s operations and  to the extent practicable  in the operations of its key business partners  in order to determine if any year risks exist that may be material to the company as a whole 
the company has obtained written assurance from several material customers who item continued expect to be year compliant in time 
the company estimates that repairing all time sensitive hardware and software will cost the company approximately  these costs will be expensed as incurred 
this process includes an assessment of year risks on an ongoing basis to alter  validate  or replace time sensitive software 
the costs associated with this process include independent verification and validation of the systems during the testing and implementation phases 
if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  management plans to devote the resources it concludes are appropriate to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner  and as such  the company has not developed a year contingency plan
