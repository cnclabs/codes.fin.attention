item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company derives revenue primarily from hotel room sales at its sumner suites and company owned shoney s inn hotels 
through march  the company managed amerisuites hotels and earned management fees for such services 
the company also receives management fees for services it performs for two franchised shoney s inns 
the company derives additional revenue from franchise fees it receives as the exclusive franchisor of shoney s inns 
the company s hotel operations have been supplemented by contract revenues from construction and development of franchised shoney s inns and  until march  amerisuites hotels for third parties 
revenues from these activities have varied widely from period to period  depending upon whether the company s construction and development activities were primarily focused on its own facilities or on outside projects 
the company has generally undertaken construction and development projects for third parties only when its capacity has been underutilized in constructing its own facilities 
construction revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
because the company expects to concentrate on the development of sumner suites  management does not anticipate generating further significant contract revenues from construction and development 
from through the first quarter of fiscal  the company developed and owned or managed hotels in the amerisuites hotel chain 
in march  the company terminated its relationship with amerisuites by i selling its option to purchase of the voting stock of suites of america  inc suites of america to prime hospitality corp 
prime hospitality for million and ii conveying to suites of america its interest in one additional amerisuites hotel for million 
five million dollars of the aggregate purchase price was paid in cash on closing  while the remaining million was paid pursuant to a note that was repaid in january in connection with the sale of its option in suites of america to the company  the company canceled million in existing indebtedness of suites of america to the company 
these transactions  together with the sale of five amerisuites hotels in and collectively  the amerisuites transaction  have been accounted for as installment sales of real estate in the company s consolidated financial statements  and a pre tax gain of million was recognized through in connection therewith 
the transactions also resulted in the recognition in fiscal of million of previously deferred management fee revenue 
during first quarter of fiscal  the company sold its ownership in five restaurants to the owner for a note receivable 
the income or loss from restaurant operations for each of the reported periods is reported as discontinued operations net of applicable income taxes and minority interest 
the company initially deferred recognition of the gain from the sale of this segment until further principal payments on the note were received 
in fiscal  of this gain was recognized and in fiscal  the remaining  was recognized as gain on disposal of discontinued business segment 
the company s hotel operations have historically been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy rates during spring and summer months  which may be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues and earnings from hotel operations 
the company s fiscal year ends on the last sunday of the calendar year 
this resulted in fiscal consisting of weeks as compared with weeks in fiscal and the company has elected to make a change in accounting for pre opening costs effective with the beginning of its fiscal year to reflect the preferable method of expensing pre opening costs as incurred  rather than capitalizing those expenditures and amortizing them over a three year period 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change for periods prior to recognized in  net of income tax effect  is a reduction in net earnings of  or per share 
the pro forma effect of this change in accounting for pre opening costs on and would be to increase hotel operating expenses by  and  respectively  for expensing these costs as incurred  and to reduce depreciation and amortization expense for and by  and  respectively

only one outside construction project was finished in early and the balance of construction and development other related to the amerisuites transaction discussed in the overview was earned in no outside construction contracts are currently in progress nor planned at present 
franchise revenues in fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to the cancellation of reservation services by two hotel chains in the first quarter of and to a decrease of  in initial franchise fee revenue from to initial franchise fees may vary widely from year to year 
at the end of fiscal there were franchised shoney s inns in operation

the gain on disposal of a discontinued business segment in was the result of the recognition of previously deferred profit from the sale of the company s interest in a restaurant subsidiary to the then owner 
the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt in was due to approximately million of equipment loans being paid off in connection with the sale leaseback transaction with a real estate investment trust

year compliance the company has commenced a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issues and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have two digit time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations 
the company has designated its information systems director to coordinate its year compliance program 
preliminary analysis has been conducted and areas have been identified where the company might be most vulnerable 
a sample of hardware and software has been tested and has operated satisfactorily 
vendors of all the major third party applications have been contacted and the company is obtaining assurances of year compliance from those vendors 
the company currently believes that it will be year compliant on a timely basis to avoid any material operations disruptions 
to date the company has not identified any material expenditures which will be required to become year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that such operations difficulties or expenditures will not be identified or experienced in the future
