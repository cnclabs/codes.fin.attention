item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a worldwide developer  publisher and mass marketer of software for use with entertainment platforms and pcs 
the company owns and operates four studios  located in the united states and the united kingdom  and publishes and distributes its software directly in north america  the united kingdom  germany and france 
the company s operating strategy is to develop and maintain a core of key brands and franchises to support the various entertainment platforms and pcs that dominate the interactive entertainment market at a given time or which the company perceives as having the potential for achieving mass market acceptance 
the company emphasizes sports simulation and arcade style software for entertainment platforms  and fantasy role playing  real time simulation  adventure and sports simulation software for pcs 
the company also engages  to a lesser extent  in the distribution of affiliated labels software and the development and publication of comic book magazines and strategy guides relating to the company s software 
the company believes the software industry is driven by the size of the installed base of entertainment platforms such as those manufactured by nintendo  sony and sega and pcs 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change  resulting in entertainment platform and related software product cycles 
no single entertainment platform or system has achieved long term dominance in the interactive entertainment market 
based on information available in and based on its historical experience with respect to the transition from to bit platforms  the company believed that software sales for bit platforms would  although continuing to decrease overall  remain substantial through the holiday season 
accordingly  the company anticipated that its sales of bit and pc software in fiscal would grow as compared to fiscal but that the majority of its revenues in fiscal would still be derived from bit software sales 
however  the bit software market matured much more rapidly than anticipated by the company  the company s christmas bit software sales were substantially lower than anticipated and  by april  the company derived minimal profits from such software sales and made the decision to exit the bit and portable software markets 
in connection with the company s decision to exit the bit and portable software markets in april  the company recorded a special cartridge video charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal  consisting of provisions of approximately million reflected in net revenues  and approximately million reflected in cost of revenues  respectively  to adjust accounts receivable and inventories at february  to their estimated net realizable values in conjunction with management s decision to exit the bit and portable software market 
the company recorded a loss from operations of million and a net loss on an after tax basis of million for fiscal the net loss for the year reflected write offs of receivables  the establishment of additional receivables and inventory reserves  severance charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of the company and the reduction of certain deferred costs  as well as an operating loss for the year resulting primarily from price protection and similar concessions granted to retailers at greater than anticipated levels in connection with the company s and bit software 
the company recorded a loss from operations of million and a net loss on an after tax basis of million for fiscal the net loss for the year reflects  among other things  a charge for certain claims and litigations for which the settlement obligation was probable and estimable of million  a write down of goodwill of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with acclaim comics to its estimated undiscounted cash flows and downsizing charges of million 
as a result of the company s acquisitions of its studios in two of which were completed in fiscal  the company s fixed costs relating to the development of software and its general and administrative expenses substantially increased in fiscal see factors affecting future performance increased product development costs 
such expenses in the aggregate had a material adverse impact on the company s profitability in fiscal and fiscal the company recorded earnings from operations of million and net earnings on an after tax basis of million for fiscal the improved results for fiscal primarily resulted from increased sales in the united states of the company s bit and  to a lesser extent  bit software 
they also reflect the company s significantly reduced operating expenses  resulting primarily from a reduction in personnel  the sale or discontinuance of certain non profitable businesses  the consolidation of certain of its studio operations to reduce their overhead expenses and various other cost reductions 
as a result of the industry transition to and bit entertainment platforms  the company s software sales during fiscal  and were significantly lower than in fiscal management expects that  unless and until the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms increases substantially  the company s unit sales and revenues from the sale of software for these platforms will be substantially lower than software sales levels achieved prior to fiscal  when the current transition began 
no assurance can be given as to the future growth of the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms or of the company s results of operations and profitability in future periods 
see factors affecting future performance industry trends  platform transition  technological change 
the rapid technological advances in game systems have significantly changed the look and feel of software as well as the software development process 
according to company estimates  the average development cost for a title three years ago was approximately  to  while the average development cost for a title for entertainment platforms and pcs is currently between million and million 
the company s ability to generate sales growth and profitability will be materially dependent on i the growth of the software market for and bit entertainment platforms and pcs and ii the company s ability to identify  develop and publish hit software for entertainment platforms with significant installed bases 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of consolidated operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended august  domestic revenues foreign revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss marketing and sales general and administrative research and development goodwill writedown litigation settlements downsizing charge total operating expenses earnings loss from operations other expense income  net earnings loss before income taxes net earnings loss net revenues the company s gross revenues were derived from the following product categories portable software bit software bit software bit software pc software other the numbers in this chart do not give effect to sales credits and allowances granted by the company in the periods covered since the company does not track such credits and allowances by product category 
such credits and allowances were material to the company s results of operations in fiscal accordingly  the numbers presented may vary materially from those that would be disclosed if the company were able to present such information as a percentage of net revenues 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to increased sales in the united states of the company s bit and  to a lesser extent  bit software 
the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in the installed base of n and playstation consoles worldwide and the quality of the company s titles 
although revenues from the sale of n and playstation software are anticipated to continue to grow in fiscal  the company does not anticipate that it will achieve its growth rate 
the company s domestic sales in fiscal comprised a higher percentage of total net revenues compared to fiscal primarily because the titles published by the company in achieved greater popularity in the domestic market eg  wwf war zone and quarterback club 
the company anticipates that its mix of domestic and foreign net revenues will continue to be affected by the content of titles released by the company 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to sales of the company s n title  turok dinosaur hunter  offset by reduced unit sales of bit software 
to date  the company has not generated material revenues from any of its operations other than software publishing and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to generate such revenues in the future 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are generally derived from software first released in that quarter or in the immediately preceding quarter 
see factors affecting future performance revenue and earnings fluctuations  seasonality 
in fiscal  wwf war zone for multiple platforms  nfl quarterback club for the n  forsaken for multiple platforms and extreme g for the n accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s gross revenues 
in fiscal  turok dinosaur hunter for the n accounted for approximately of the company s gross revenues 
in fiscal  no single title accounted for a significant portion of the company s gross revenues 
in addition  in fiscal  sales of software manufactured by interplay accounted for approximately of the company s gross revenues 
see business distribution of affiliated labels 
the company did not derive material revenues from the sales of affiliated labels software in fiscal and and does not anticipate that such sales will be material in fiscal the company is substantially dependent on nintendo  sony and sega as the sole manufacturers of the entertainment platforms marketed by them  as the sole licensors of the proprietary information and technology needed to develop software for those platforms and on nintendo and sony as the sole manufacturers of software for the entertainment platforms marketed by them 
for the years ended august   and  the company derived  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of nintendo compatible software   and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of software for playstation and  and less than of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of sega compatible software

gross profit gross profit fluctuates primarily as a result of five factors i the level of returns  sales credits and allowances  ii the number of hit products and average unit selling prices  iii the percentage of sales of cd software  iv the percentage of foreign sales  and v the percentage of foreign sales to third party distributors 
all royalties payable to nintendo  sony and sega are included in cost of revenues 
the company s gross profit is adversely impacted by increases in the level of returns and allowances to retailers  which reduces the average unit price obtained for its software sales 
similarly  lack of hit titles or a low number of hit titles  resulting in lower average unit sales prices  adversely impacts the company s gross profits 
the company s margins on sales of cd software currently  playstation and pcs are higher than those on cartridge software currently  n as a result of significantly lower cd software product costs 
the company s margins on foreign software sales are typically lower than those on domestic sales due to higher prices charged by hardware licensors for software distributed by the company outside north america 
the company s margins on foreign software sales to third party distributors are approximately one third lower than those on sales that the company makes directly to foreign retailers 
gross profit increased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  predominantly due to increased unit sales and higher unit selling prices of the company s software 
gross profit increased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  primarily as a result of lower levels of returns and allowances 
management anticipates that the company s future gross profit will be affected principally by i the percentage of returns  sales credits and allowances and other similar concessions in respect of the company s software sales and ii the company s product mix ie  the percentage of cd software 
although gross margins on sales of cd software are higher than on cartridge software  management believes that if the company is required to institute stock balancing programs for its pc software  the company will experience higher rates of returns of such product as compared to the historical rate of return of cartridge software 
in such event  management anticipates that its reserves for such returns will increase  thereby offsetting a portion of the higher gross margins generated from pc software sales 
the company purchases substantially all of its products at prices payable in united states dollars 
appreciation of the yen could result in increased prices charged by nintendo  sony or sega to the company although  to date  none of them has effected such a price increase  which the company may not be able to pass on to its customers and which could adversely affect its results of operations 
operating expenses in fiscal  the company effected a variety of cost reduction measures to reduce its operating expenses 
the company realized the benefits of such measures in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal in the form of reduced operating expenses as compared to prior periods 
in addition  in fiscal  the company consolidated or eliminated certain operations 
marketing and sales expenses decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  and to million of net revenues for the year ended august  the percentage decrease is primarily attributable to increased sales volume and cost reduction efforts initiated by the company to reduce its operating expenses 
the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to increased sales volume 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  and to million of net revenues for the year ended august  primarily due to the cost reduction efforts initiated by the company 
research and development expenses decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  and to million of net revenues for the year ended august   primarily due to the consolidation of certain of the company s studio operations  reduced personnel cost and other cost reduction efforts initiated by the company 
although the company anticipates that its operating expenses will increase in dollars in fiscal  it does not anticipate that such expenses will increase materially as a percentage of net revenues 
however  no assurance can be given that the company s operating expenses will not increase as a percentage of net revenues or that the cost reduction measures heretofore effected will not materially adversely affect the company s ability to develop and publish commercially viable titles  or that such measures  whether alone or in conjunction with increased revenues if any  will be sufficient to generate operating profits in fiscal and beyond

due to acclaim comics operating losses through may  management s assessment of the state of the comic book industry and management s projections for acclaim comics operations  management believed that there was an impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill relating to the july acquisition of acclaim comics 
accordingly  the company recorded a write down of million of goodwill in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with acclaim comics to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
in conjunction with certain claims and litigations for which the settlement obligation was then probable and estimable  the company recorded a charge of million during fiscal no assurance can be given that the company will not be required to record additional material charges in future periods in conjunction with the litigations to which the company is a party

seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with higher revenues and operating income typically occurring during its first  second and fourth fiscal quarters which correspond to the holiday selling season
