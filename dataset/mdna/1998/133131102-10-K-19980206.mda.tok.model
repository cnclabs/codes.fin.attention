the shares were issued from the company s recently filed million universal shelf registration statement discussed in liquidity below 
net proceeds from the july equity offering were used to retire certain secured indebtedness assumed in the paragon acquisition and to reduce amounts outstanding under the million unsecured line of credit the unsecured credit facility which had been advanced to fund recent property developments  acquisitions and other working capital requirements 
camden has maintained on a quarterly basis a financial structure with no more than total debt to total market capitalization since the camden ipo in july at december   the company s ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was approximately based on the closing price of per common share of the company on the new york stock exchange composite tape on december  
this ratio represents total consolidated debt of the company as a percentage of the market value of the company s common shares including common shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities and op units  but excluding common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options plus total consolidated debt excluding the convertible securities 
the interest coverage ratio was times for the fourth quarter of and times and times for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
at december  and  and  respectively  of the company s properties based on invested capital were unencumbered 
liquidity 
the company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash flows provided by operations  the unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings 
the company uses equity capital and senior unsecured debt to refinance maturing secured debt and borrowings under its unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings

the company determines the amount of cash available for distribution from the operating partnership in accordance with the partnership agreement and has distributed and intends to continue to make distributions to the holders of op units in amounts equivalent to the per share dividends paid to holders of common shares 
the company intends to continue shareholder distributions in accordance with reit qualification requirements under the federal tax code while maintaining what management believes to be a conservative payout ratio  and expects to continue reducing the payout ratio by raising the dividends at a rate which is less than the funds from operations ffo growth rate 
financial flexibility 
the company concentrates its growth efforts toward selective development and acquisition opportunities in its core markets  and through the acquisition of existing operating portfolios and development properties in selected new markets

the company funds its developments and acquisitions through a combination of equity capital  op units  debt securities  the unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowing arrangements  and previously has used construction and other mortgage loans 
the company also seeks to selectively dispose of assets that are not in core markets  have a lower projected net operating income growth rate than the overall portfolio  or no longer conform to the company s operating and investment strategies 
the million in net proceeds received from these asset disposals during were reinvested in developments and used to retire debt 
the company s unsecured credit facility matures july  one year prior to maturity  this note becomes a term loan  unless it is extended  renegotiated or repaid 
the scheduled interest rate on the loan is currently based on libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points 
this scheduled rate is subject to change as the company s credit ratings change 
advances under the unsecured credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rate  or the company may enter into bid rate loans bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rate 
these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the unsecured credit facility 
the unsecured credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 
as an alternative to its unsecured credit facility  the company from time to time borrows using competitively bid unsecured short term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured credit facility bank group 
such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured credit facility 
on may   the company issued from its recently filed million universal shelf registration statement an aggregate principal amount of million of its unsecured reset notes maturing may the reset notes 
during the one year period ending may   the interest rate on the reset notes  which will be reset quarterly  will equal day libor plus basis points and interest will be payable on a quarterly basis 
after the one year period  the mode and duration of the interest rate on the reset notes will be reset by the company and a remarketing underwriter as either fixed or floating and for durations of six months to four years 
the reset notes are direct  senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company 
the reset notes are redeemable after may  at the option of the company at par value 
the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the reset notes were million 
the company used the net proceeds to reduce indebtedness incurred under the unsecured credit facility which had been used to liquidate portions of the debt assumed in the paragon acquisition 
on june   the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes from its million medium term note shelf registration 
these fixed rate notes  due in june  bear interest at the annual rate of  payable semiannually on march and september the net proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under short term unsecured notes

funds from operations management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  extraordinary or unusual items  along with significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measure of ffo are typically disregarded in its calculation 
the company s definition of ffo also assumes conversion at the beginning of the period of all convertible securities including minority interests which are convertible into common equity 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation 
camden s ffo for the year ended december  increased million over primarily due to the paragon acquisition  property acquisitions  developments and improvements in the performance of the stabilized properties in the portfolio

inflation the company leases apartments under lease terms generally ranging from six to thirteen months 
management believes that such short term lease contracts lessen the impact of inflation due to the ability to adjust rental rates to market levels as leases expire 
year conversion camden has recognized the need to ensure that its systems  equipment and operations will not be adversely impacted by the change to the calendar year as such  the company has taken steps to identify potential areas of risk and has begun addressing these in its planning  purchasing and daily operations 
the total cost of converting all internal systems  equipment and operations to the year has not been fully quantified  but it is not expected to be a material cost to camden 
however  no estimates can be made as to the potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year camden is attempting to identify those risks as well as to receive compliance certificates from all third parties that have a material impact on camden s operations
