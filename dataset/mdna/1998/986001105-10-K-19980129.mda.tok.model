the company s revenues were   and  for the years ended october   and  respectively 
revenues increased in primarily as the result of sales gains in warehouse clubs and international segments  as well as the introduction of new products 
the revenue gains of in  in  and in over the prior year are reflective of the company s basic strategy 
fundamental to this strategy is the competitive success of the company s products and the introduction of cutting edge new products 
the successes are also due to an established national distribution system including a network of brokers and distributors  expanded direct sales activity  and alliances with other national companies 
management expects this trend to continue as it executes its aggressive growth plan  which includes expanded alliances with other national companies  intensified direct sales activity  and the introduction of new products 
the new products introduced in the last two years include soft scoop by yo cream which is a oz single serve cup of frozen yogurt or sorbet specifically developed in to facilitate national distribution 
this product can be distributed at zero degrees compared to minus twenty degrees for most frozen dairy dessert products 
at the national restaurant association food show in may  the company introduced yo cream pure 
this is the company s new line of nonfat soft serve frozen yogurt and low fat ice cream cups made from organic milk

the company has also developed a new line of nonfat and nondairy yo cream smooothies which include ready to serve products the complete fruit smoothie and premixes for blender operation yo cream  the smoothie way 
the response to these products has been exceptional  opening a new vista of opportunity for branded and private branded sales 
near the end of the fiscal year the yo cream branded smoothies were introduced into the burgerville and taco del mar restaurant chains 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  costco selected the company s smoothies for introduction into its food courts 
other significant contracts are pending 
food service sales  which represent approximately of sales  showed substantial improvement over the prior year  and would have contributed to a significant increase in overall sales had it not been for the loss of one major  low margin account 
this lost account was replaced with higher margin business 
management believes that the improvement in this segment is primarily due to the program of establishing its own regional sales managers and product specialists

shipments to panama and the philippines are expected during the first quarter of fiscal the company is also in the process of developing other strategic alliances with national companies that are expected to increase both branded and private branded sales 
the cost of sales  as a percentage of revenues  were   and in  and respectively  with corresponding gross profit margins of   and for the same periods 
during fiscal margins improved due to increased sales activity  and price increases which were implemented earlier in the year 
during fiscal margins decreased as a result of aggressive pricing earlier in the year to gain market share  and additional costs associated with business expansion 
increases were also experienced in the cost of ingredients  transportation  and warehousing 
however  as a result of the company s analysis of both market conditions and its costs  the company increased prices during the fourth quarter in the food service and certain other segments of its business 
the increase in the gross margin for  as compared to  was primarily the result of increased production efficiencies 
production has increased  but is below plant capacity 
therefore  in the absence of increases in direct costs  management believes that the economies of scale from increased sales and production could result in improvements in gross profit margin and net income in the future 
selling and marketing expenses  as a percentage of revenues  for the years ended october   and were   and respectively 
while such expenses are a direct function of sales and will vary in dollar amount in relation to the level of sales  management has exercised care in controlling these costs

the increase in also reflects the company s expanded marketing and sales activity
