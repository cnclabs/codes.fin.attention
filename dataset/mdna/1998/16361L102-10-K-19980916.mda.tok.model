year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
with respect to its internal systems  the company is taking appropriate steps to remediate the year issues 
systems critical to the business which have been identified as non year compliant either have been  or are being replaced or corrected through programming modifications 
outside companies such as vendors  major customers  service suppliers  communications providers and banks are being asked to verify their year readiness and the company is testing interaction with such systems where appropriate 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to a have material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to assure year compliance  it is dependent on key business partner compliance to some extent 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without costs that might affect future results or cause reporting financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial condition
