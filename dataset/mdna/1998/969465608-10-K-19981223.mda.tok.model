year conversion 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date are a known risk 
the company is addressing this risk to the availability and integrity of financial systems and the reliability of the operational systems 
the company has established processes for evaluating and managing the risks and cost associated with this problem  including communicating with suppliers  dealers and others with which it does business to coordinate year conversion 
the total cost of compliance and its effect on the company s future results of operations is being determined as part of the detailed conversion planning process 
during  the company began implementing the installation of new financial software that is year compliant for the purpose of improving operations and service to its existing and prospective truck and automotive customers

the company has hired outside consultants for its year project  and it may need to purchase additional hardware or software 
the company acquires a majority of its inventory from approximately vendors 
if these vendors have unresolved year issues which affect their ability to supply merchandise  the company could be adversely affected 
the company plans to complete a year readiness survey of its top vendors by march in the event that it appears a vendor will be adversely affected by year issues  the company believes that it will be able to find alternative suppliers 
should the company not achieve full compliance in a timely manner or complete its year project within its current cost estimates  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
however  in the event that the company fails to meet the deadlines above  the company believes that the financial impact will not be material since all systems believed by the company to be critical are expected to be year compliant
