tactical vehicle systems contract status major contracts for military systems are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
the company s ultimate profitability on such contracts will depend not only upon the accuracy of the company s cost projections  but also the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government 
the fmtv contract is a firm fixed price multi year contract whereby the price paid to the company is not subject to adjustment to reflect the company s actual costs  except costs incurred as a result of actions or inactions of the government 
stewart stevenson has incurred significant cost overruns and delivery schedule delays on the fmtv contract which the company believes are primarily due to the government s decision to delay the testing of trucks and other government directed changes to the contract 
the company has and will continue to submit a series of requests for equitable adjustments reas  under the fmtv contract  seeking increases in the fmtv contract price for those additional costs that relate to government caused delays and changes 
revenues and profits realized on the fmtv contract are based on the company s estimates of total contract sales value and costs at completion 
amounts in excess of agreed upon contract price for government caused delays  disruptions  unpriced change orders and government caused additional contract costs are recognized in contract value when the company believes it is probable that the claim for such amounts will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at january   the company s fmtv contract accounting position reflects the expected recovery of substantial amounts in excess of the contract price for government caused delays  disruptions  unpriced change orders and other government caused additional contract costs 
these claims are in varying stages of negotiation 
although management believes that the contract provides a legal basis for the claims and its estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and on a reasonable analysis of contract costs  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation and claims negotiations process  no assurances can be given that its estimates will be accurate  and variances between such estimates and actual results could be material 
in the event that the company is unable to recover a substantial portion of the additional costs  the company may suffer a material adverse effect on its earnings during the accounting period in which such contract issues are resolved 
under the terms of the fmtv contract  approximately  vehicles produced before december were required to be retrofitted with any modifications required by test results or specification changes ordered by the us government 
this retrofit program was commenced during the fourth quarter of fiscal and was substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal full rate production of the fmtv commenced after the retrofit program was substantially completed and  as of january   the company has completed approximately  of the  vehicles covered by the original contract plus options and additional requirements to date 
during fiscal  the company entered into a contract modification that extended the fmtv delivery schedule through december and reduced the annual product requirements 
the total number of vehicles covered by the fmtv contract did not change 
the funding of the contract is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts  the fmtv contracts must be funded annually by the department of the army and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
as of january   the company has received full funding for the current contract 
if the fmtv contract is terminated other than for default  the fmtv contract provides for termination charges that will reimburse the company for allowable costs  but not necessarily all costs 
during fiscal  the company revised its estimate of the total cost to complete and profit on the existing fmtv contract 
this review resulted in a write off of approximately million in profits previously recognized under the fmtv contract and a reduction in the operating profit percentage on the tactical vehicle systems segment to 
during fiscal  the company began negotiations with the us army to produce additional fmtv s under a new multi unit contract on a sole source basis 
these negotiations are expected to be completed during fiscal  and  if the contract is awarded to the company  it is anticipated that production will begin in fiscal  subject to the multi year funding requirements described above 
effect of certain litigation during fiscal  the company entered a plea agreement and a settlement agreement resolving all litigation relating to the contract to supply diesel generator sets for installation in the kingdom of saudi arabia the peace shield litigation 
the company paid a million criminal fine  a million civil penalty  and million in restitution to the us air force 
a million provision for fines  penalties  restitution and certain unrecognized legal fees in connection with the peace shield litigation was made in the third quarter of fiscal after the end of fiscal  the company entered an administrative agreement with the united states air force that extends the application of the interim administrative agreement signed on november  and imposes certain requirements on the company intended to assure the us air force that the company is a responsible government contractor 
a default by the company of the requirements under the administrative agreement could result in the suspension or debarment of the company from receiving any new contracts or subcontracts with agencies of the us government or the benefit of federal assistance payments 
any such suspension could also prevent the company from receiving future modifications to the fmtv contract unless the secretary of the army finds a compelling need to enter into such modification 
the company would also be unable to sell equipment and services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from the export import bank exim bank  overseas private investment corporation opic and similar government agencies during a suspension or debarment 
any such suspension or debarment could have a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations
