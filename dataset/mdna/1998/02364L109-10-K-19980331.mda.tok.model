the company has completed an assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year issue cost is estimated to be immaterial to the operating results of the company 
estimated costs consist primarily of the purchase of new software that will be capitalized 
to date  the company has incurred minimal expenses relating to the year issue 
the project is estimated to be completed not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact of the year issue on the company s operating systems

however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not timely completed  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the estimated date of completion are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
there can be no guarantee  however  that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
