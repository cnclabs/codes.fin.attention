in addition  the company produces and sells sodium azide  the primary component of a gas generant used in automotive airbag safety systems  and halotron tm  a chemical used in fire suppression systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
the perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron tm facilities are located on the company s property in southern utah and the chemicals produced and sold at these facilities collectively represent the company s specialty chemical segment 
the company s other lines of business include the development of real estate in nevada and the production of environmental protection equipment  including waste water and seawater treatment systems 
the company has incurred net losses during the last three fiscal years and an operating loss during the fiscal year ended september  as a result  pre tax income has not been sufficient to recover interest charges 
the company believes that north american demand for ap is currently approximately to million pounds annually 
however  supply capacity has historically been substantially in excess of these estimated demand levels 
in an to effort rationalize the economics of the existing ap market  the company entered into the purchase agreement with kerr mcgee 
upon consummation of the acquisition  the company effectively became the sole north american producer of ap 
sales and operating revenues 
sales of the company s perchlorate chemical products  consisting almost entirely of ap sales  accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in general  demand for ap is driven by a relatively small number of dod and nasa contractors  as a result  any one individual ap customer usually accounts for a significant portion of the revenues of ap manufacturers 
for example  thiokol accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
sodium azide sales accounted for approximately  and of sales during fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company incurred significant operating losses in its sodium azide operation in the fiscal year and prior fiscal years 
sodium azide performance improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  principally as a result of additional sodium azide deliveries under the autoliv agreement referred to below  and the operations were cash flow positive during the year ended september  however  even though performance improved  management s view of the economics of the sodium azide market changed during the fourth quarter of fiscal one major inflator manufacturer announced the acquisition of non azide based inflator technology and that it intended to be in the market with this new technology by model year in addition  although the company had achieved significant gains in market share that appeared to relate to the company s anti dumping petition and the suspension agreement  management believed that the effects of the anti dumping petition were likely fully incorporated into the sodium azide market by the end of fiscal recognizing that the uncertainties respecting the market and discussed above continued to exist  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management concluded that the cash flows associated with sodium azide operations would not be sufficient to recover the company s investment in sodium azide related fixed assets 
as quoted market prices were not available  the present value of estimated future cash flows was used to estimate the fair value of sodium azide fixed assets 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 and as a result of this valuation technique  an impairment charge of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company for further discussion of the impairment charge 
in june  july and august of this year  shipments of sodium azide were negatively impacted by the recent labor strike at certain general motors gm facilities 
although this strike has recently been settled  the company is unable to predict any further impact this strike may have on its sodium azide operations 
sales of halotron tm amounted to approximately  and less than of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
halotron tm is designed to replace halon based fire suppression systems 
accordingly  demand for halotron tm depends upon a number of factors including the willingness of consumers to switch from halon based systems  as well as existing and potential governmental regulations 
real estate and related sales amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the nature of real estate development and sales is such that the company is unable reliably to predict any pattern of future real estate sales or recognition of the equity in earnings of real estate ventures 
environmental protection equipment sales accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
it is currently anticipated that sales of this segment will be adversely affected in fiscal and perhaps beyond by the continuing adverse economic developments and conditions in the company s foreign markets particularly asian markets 
cost of sales 
the principal elements comprising the company s cost of sales are raw materials  electric power  labor  manufacturing overhead and the basis in the real estate sold 
the major raw materials used by the company in its production processes are graphite  sodium chlorate  ammonia  hydrochloric acid  sodium metal  and nitrous oxide 
significant increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse impact on margins if the company is unable to pass along such increases to its customers  although all the raw materials used in the company s manufacturing processes have historically been available in commercial quantities  and the company has had no difficulty obtaining necessary raw materials 
raw material  electric power and labor costs have not changed significantly in the past three fiscal years 
the costs of operating the company s specialty chemical plants are largely fixed 
accordingly  the company believes that the potential additional ap sales volume resulting from the acquisition should generate significant incremental cash flow because of the operating leverage associated with the perchlorate plant 
however  amortization of the acquisition costs are expected to amount to approximately million annually 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
operating expenses in fiscal include approximately million in costs related to the investigation and evaluation of the trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead see note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company is unable to determine the extent to which similar costs will be incurred in the future 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal year the company s effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal as a result of the establishment of a million deferred tax valuation allowance 
the company s effective tax rate will be until the company s net operating losses expire or the company has taxable income necessary to eliminate the need for the valuation allowance 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
net income loss 
although the company s net income loss and diluted net income loss per common share have not been subject to seasonal fluctuations  they have been and are expected to continue to be subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the following factors  among others i as discussed in note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company  the company may incur material legal and other costs associated with certain litigation and contingencies  ii the timing of real estate and related sales and equity earnings of real estate ventures is not predictable  iii the recognition of revenues from environmental protection equipment orders not accounted for as long term contracts depends upon orders generated and the timing of shipment of the equipment  iv weighted average common and common equivalent shares for purposes of calculating diluted net income loss per common share are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the market price of the company s common stock due to outstanding warrants and options  and v the magnitude  pricing and timing of ap  sodium azide  halotron tm  and environmental protection equipment sales in the future is uncertain 
see forward looking statements risk factors below 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  sales and operating revenues 
sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased sales in the company s specialty chemical operations 
the increase in specialty chemical sales was partially offset by decreases in environmental protection equipment and real estate sales 
specialty chemical sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was principally attributable to an increase in perchlorate sales of million 
the increase in perchlorate sales was attributable to additional ap sales volume subsequent to the acquisition 
sodium azide sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal due principally to a decrease in shipments to autoliv in the fourth quarter as a result of the gm strike referred to above 
in may  the company entered into a three year agreement with autoliv 
the agreement provides for the company to supply sodium azide used by autoliv in the manufacture of automotive airbags 
deliveries under the agreement commenced in july the current estimated sales value of the agreement is approximately million over the three year period 
the actual sales value  however  will depend upon many factors beyond the control of the company  such as the number of automobiles and light trucks manufactured and competitive conditions in the airbag market  which will influence the actual magnitude of autoliv s sodium azide requirements  and there can therefore be no assurance as to the actual sales value of the agreement 
halotron tm sales were million in fiscal and environmental protection sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a decrease in equipment shipments 
real estate sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to a decrease in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to the increase in perchlorate sales volume offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million as a result of the sodium azide impairment charge referred to above 
cost of sales is expected to increase an additional million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a full year s amortization of capitalized acquisition costs

segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of the company s industry segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals   environmental protection equipment   real estate   total   the increase in operating income of the specialty chemical segment was attributable to the fixed asset impairment charge of million discussed above and the increase in perchlorate sales and operating performance as a result of the acquisition 
the decrease in operating income of the real estate segment was attributable to a decrease in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in fiscal from million in the increase was principally due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the issuance of the notes

the increase in specialty chemical sales was partially offset by decreases in environmental protection equipment and real estate sales 
specialty chemical sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to increases in perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron tm sales of million  million and million  respectively 
this increase in perchlorate sales was primarily attributable to sales of ap to alliant  for use in solid rocket boosters related to the delta launch vehicle program 
sodium azide sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due principally to an increase in shipments to autoliv resulting from the three year agreement referred to above 
halotron tm sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to increased sales to original equipment manufacturers as a result of the continued acceptance of halotron in the market 
environmental protection sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a decrease in spare part sales 
real estate sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to a decrease in land sales from fiscal cost of sales

operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal fixed asset impairment charge 
as discussed above  the company recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal employee separation and management reorganization costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a charge of million associated with employee separations and management reorganization costs 
in addition  relocation costs of approximately million were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal equity in earnings of real estate venture 
during fiscal and  the company recognized its share of the equity in the company s ventana canyon joint venture 
the company s equity in the earnings of the project amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
profits and losses are split equally between the company and its venture partner  a local real estate development company 
the venture s profits decreased during fiscal principally as a result of the sale of improved land zoned for an apartment site to an outside developer during fiscal segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of the company s industry segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals   environmental protection equipment   real estate   total   the increase in operating loss of the specialty chemical segment relates principally to the fixed asset impairment charge of million discussed above 
the increase in operating loss of the environmental protection equipment segment was primarily due to a reduction in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in operating income of the real estate segment was attributable to a decrease in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in the decrease was principally due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in debt balances 
inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  inflation may have an effect on gross profit in the future as certain of the company s agreements with ap and sodium azide customers require fixed prices  although certain of such agreements contain escalation features that should somewhat insulate the company from increases in costs associated with inflation 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in notes and to notes to consolidated financial statement of the company  in march  the company sold notes in the principal amount of million  acquired certain assets from kerr mcgee for a cash purchase price of million and paid million to repurchase the remaining million principal amount outstanding of the azide notes 
the company incurred approximately million in costs associated with the issuance of the notes 
in connection with the azide notes repurchase  the company recognized an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million 
in september  the company repurchased and retired million principal amount of notes 
although the repurchase was effected at below par  the company incurred an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million as a result of writing off costs associated with the issuance of the notes 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the changes in cash flows from operating activities result principally from changes in certain working capital balances 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of its operations 
however  the resolution of litigation and contingencies  and the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for ap  sodium azide and halotron tm  may have an effect on the use and availability of cash 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
capital expenditures are budgeted to amount to approximately million in fiscal and relate principally to specialty chemical segment capital improvement projects 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during the three year period ended september  the company repaid or repurchased million of debt  repurchased million in treasury stock and issued million in common stock as a result of the exercise of outstanding stock options 
during fiscal  the company received cash of approximately million from its ventana canyon joint venture 
the company currently anticipates that cash returns of invested capital and equity in earnings will continue through the conclusion of the project currently projected to be the end of calendar as a result of the litigation and contingencies discussed in note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company  the company has incurred legal and other costs  and it may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of contingencies in future periods 
any such costs  to the extent borne by the company and not recovered through insurance  would adversely affect the company s liquidity 
the company is currently unable to predict or quantify the amount or range of such costs or the period of time over which such costs will be incurred 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating and resolving the problems that might be associated with the year issue 
the company s year project has four major components evaluation of all major manufacturing and business computing systems to determine which systems are year compliant 
for each computing system found not to be year compliant  development of a strategy to replace  modify or upgrade the system to a year compliant system 
evaluation of core vendors for year compliance 
preparation of contingency plans 
the company s evaluation found that the most critical digital control system  which is used in the manufacture of specialty chemical products  is year compliant 
the company has received a letter of certification from its vendor  and the company has tested the system by turning the dates forward on the computers to the year  and all systems functioned normally 
the company s accounting system is being upgraded to a year compliant version 
this upgrade is in process  and should be completed in the second quarter of fiscal new maintenance and manufacturing mrp software packages are currently being implemented  and each is certified and tested as year compliant 
the majority of pc computers used by the company are pentium class  running microsoft s windows operating system  and are year compliant 
the company s file servers are running on pentium computers with microsoft nt  and each of these is also certified year compliant 
the company also uses microsoft s office suite  which is year compliant 
during the evaluation phase of its year project  the company identified certain potential issues related to many of its programmable logic controller units used in the manufacturing process and certain of the company s laboratory instruments and the computers and software with which they operate 
the company is in the process of updating the equipment that is not year compliant 
the company is also in the process of developing contingency plans for the year issue 
the company recently reevaluated its estimates and assumptions of the costs directly associated with its year project and currently estimates that approximately million in costs will be incurred that are directly associated with the project 
at september   the company had incurred approximately million in costs that were directly related to its year project 
given the inherent risks for a project of this nature  the timing and costs involved could differ materially from those anticipated by the company 
there can be no assurance that the year project will be completed on schedule or within budget
