general act develops  manufactures  and markets wide area network wan access products which support a broad range of integrated voice and data network applications 
service providers and enterprise customers use the company s products to build multimedia networks that are bandwidth efficient  cost effective and easy to manage 
the company s products incorporate advanced voice and data compression algorithms  enhanced switching and traffic management capabilities  and state of the art hardware and software integration technologies 
the company is migrating toward two principal product families  netperformer and servicexchange  which share a common technology foundation but are targeted at different market segments 
netperformer is a family of frame relay access devices frads targeted at enterprise customers who need to integrate and transport voice  fax  lan  and sna data over private or public frame relay networks 
servicexchange addresses the needs of service providers who are especially focused on transporting large volumes of voice traffic cost effectively over frame relay  atm  or ip backbones 
within each family  both chassis based and stand alone configurations will be offered to serve specific customer requirements for price  performance  density  and feature set 
the company s future results will be dependent upon a variety of factors including  without limitation  the company s ability to develop and release new products in a timely manner and within anticipated budgets 
while the company anticipates the release of new products in fiscal  there can be no assurance that such products will be released when anticipated or that such products will achieve market acceptance 
the company anticipates that  in general  the average sales price for its products will decrease over time due to competition and other factors 
the company is currently focusing on developing oem or similar relationships with third parties  which may result in significant pricing discounts and lower gross margins 
in addition  the company has from time to time introduced new products which are less expensive alternatives to the company s older products 
in such instances  the company must sell more units to maintain the same level of aggregate net sales 
price erosion of existing products  significant discounting and the company s introduction of less expensive networking alternatives could adversely affect the company s margins and results of operations 
sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net sales in future periods 
in addition  the company believes that a significant portion of its sales to customers inside north america represent sales of products which are used or resold in markets outside of north america 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  problems and delays in collecting accounts receivable and economic downturns in foreign markets 
a significant number of the company s products are sold or installed in countries  including several in south america and asia  where political or economic issues have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  the purchasing decision of the customer 
in addition  fluctuations in currency exchange rates have caused  and may in the future cause  the company s products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
the company believes that recent events in asia and south america will adversely impact the company s net sales in these regions in the near term 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net sales 
in particular  interexchange accounted for approximately of the company s net sales for the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal years ended june   and  the company s five largest customers collectively accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales 
any reduction  delay or change in orders from significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business

in august  the company acquired out of bankruptcy certain assets of sourcecom  inc  a developer of high performance broadband access devises 
in connection with these acquisitions  the company expensed a portion of the purchase prices as in process research and development 
the products and technologies acquired in the dynatech communications  inc and deltacomm corporation acquisitions are being either de emphasized or discontinued 
restructuring program in july  the company announced a major restructuring program designed to streamline operations and focus on key markets 
as part of the restructuring program  the company is concentrating its resources on the netperformer and servicexchange product lines 
in connection with the restructuring  the company is significantly reducing its workforce  eliminating its business unit matrix structure in favor of a functional organization and de emphasizing engineering  sales and marketing efforts for non strategic products

year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal activities
