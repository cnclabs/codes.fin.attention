item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance standard analog integrated circuits 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the communications  computer and industrial markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mix signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
the company has shifted its focus and revenue base from custom and foundry products to standard products 
for   and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  competitive pricing pressures and the company s ability to meet increasing demand 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the company declared a two for one stock split of its common stock in the form of a stock dividend payable august   on shares of common stock outstanding as of august  all share and per share information has been adjusted to retroactively give effect to the stock split for all periods presented 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net revenues 
net revenues increased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million in principally due to higher standard product revenues  which grew to of net revenues from in sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  computer peripheral ic components  mos drivers  and switching regulators 
such products were sold to manufacturers of portable computing  computing peripherals  telecommunications and industrial products 
while the company has experienced some slowdown in asian orders recently  the company believes that growth in other revenue channels will be sufficient to offset any slowdown in orders from the company s asian customers 
the company believes that pricing pressures continue to be experienced by the general technology sector and by companies in the analog segment of the semiconductor industry despite an increase in unit demand for integrated circuits 
in the fourth quarter of  standard product customer demand continued to be short term focused due to shorter than historical order lead times 
these factors affect the company s ability to predict future sales growth  profitability and forward visibility 
the company s ability to predict demand in future quarters also continues to be affected by the trend of its customers to place orders close to desired shipment dates and to reduce their long term purchasing commitments  which is the result of less predictable demand for such customers products and increased product availability in the semiconductor industry 
the company has sought to address these reduced order lead times by implementing faster production cycles 
net revenues increased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million in principally due to higher standard product revenues  which grew to of net revenues from in sales of standard products by the company were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  computer peripherals  latched drivers and metal oxide semiconductor drivers and such products were sold to manufacturers of portable computing  computing peripherals  industrial and telecommunications products 
international sales represented  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in international sales resulted from shipments to manufacturers of personal computers and communications products and demand for the company s products primarily in asian markets and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic and canadian distributors until such distributors resell the company s products to their customers 
sales to international distributors are recognized upon shipment 
the company estimates international distributor returns and provides an allowance when the revenue is recognized 
gross margin 
gross margin is affected by the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin reflected an increase in manufacturing efficiency resulting from greater capacity utilization 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin reflects an increase in manufacturing efficiency resulting from greater capacity utilization  cost reductions  yield improvements and spreading of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overhead over a larger sales base that was partially offset by an increase in fixed expense levels associated with the expansion of manufacturing facilities 
manufacturing yields  which affect gross margin  may from time to time decline because the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
factors such as minute impurities and difficulties in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of standard products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
the company s research and development expenses increased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with the company s conversion to six inch wafer fabrication  and increased expenses due to engineering staffing  design services  and prototype wafers to support the development of new standard products 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new standard products is critical to its future success and expects that research and development expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future 
the company s research and development expenses increased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with the company s conversion to six inch wafer fabrication and with design services  and prototype wafers used to support the development of new standard products 
in addition to these factors  the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was also due to increased salary expenses associated with expanded engineering staffing to support the development of new standard products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for while decreasing on a percentage basis to in from of net revenues in the dollar increase was due  in part  to higher commissions  advertising and other sales and administrative expenses associated with the growth of the company s standard products revenues 
although the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future  the company seeks to have such expenses not increase as a percentage of net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for while increasing on a percentage basis to in from of net revenues in the dollar increase was due  in part  to higher commissions  compensation  and other sales and marketing and promotion expenses associated with the growth of the company s sales organization to support continuing revenue growth as well as a profit sharing accrual to promote personnel retention 
other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities offset by interest incurred on line of credit borrowings and term notes 
other income  net increased by approximately  to  in from  in such increase reflected a  increase in interest income due to an management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued increase in average cash and investment balances and decrease in interest expense by  due to a reduction in the average amount of notes payable 
the company expects to continue to utilize term financing as appropriate to finance its capital equipment needs 
other income  net increased by approximately  to  in from  in such increase reflected a  gain on the settlement of litigation  which was offset by a  decrease in interest income due to a decline in average interest rates and an increase in interest expense of  due to higher average outstanding loan balances 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was million or of income before provision for income taxes compared to million or for the income tax provision differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was million or of income before provision for income taxes compared to million or for the income tax provision differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation established by the company in the first quarter of  state research and development credits  state manufacturing credits and the reinstitution of the federal research and development tax credit in july liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of cash and short term investments of million and borrowing facilities consisting of i million under a revolving line of credit  of which all was unused and available  and ii million under a non revolving line of credit  under which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  the two lines of credit are covered by the same loan and security agreement 
this agreement expires on september   subject to automatic renewal on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party upon days notice 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the non revolving bank line of credit that is covered by the loan agreement described above  can be used to fund purchases of capital equipment whereby the company may borrow up to of the cost  excluding installation charges  sales tax  freight and software charges 
amounts borrowed under this credit line may be converted to four year installment notes 
all equipment notes are collateralized by the equipment purchased  bear interest at prime and are subject to the same restrictive covenants as the revolving line of credit 
under two other notes payable  the company had million and million outstanding at december  the notes are collateralized by the equipment purchased 
the company s working capital increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable of million combined with increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million which was partially offset by a million reduction in inventories as of december  the company s short term investments were principally invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s cash flows from operating activities increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period and to a million decrease in inventory combined with a million tax benefit from employee stock transactions  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities increased to approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily attributable to net income of million for the year ended december  and increases in income taxes payable and accrued compensation coupled with decreases in accounts receivable  which were offset by increases in inventories 
the company s investing activities in the year ended december  used cash of approximately million compared to million for the increase in cash used by investing activities resulted primarily from an incremental million increase in equipment purchases and leasehold improvements primarily relating to the six inch wafer fabrication operation for the year ended december  and million in net additional purchases of short term investments 
financing activities for the year ended december  provided cash of approximately million as compared to million of cash used in financing activities for the comparable period in this change was the result of an increase of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  and a million reduction in repayments of long term debt during the same periods 
the company currently intends to spend up to approximately million during the next twelve months primarily for the purchase of additional wafer and test manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its existing cash balances and short term investments  cash from operations and its existing credit facilities 
factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  and statements regarding the levels of international sales 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to meet increasing demand  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  the company s access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued development costs 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has transitioned its business to rely more heavily on the sale of standard products 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will continue to depend upon standard products sales 
as compared with the custom and foundry products business  the standard products business is characterized by shorter product lifecycles  greater pricing pressures  larger competitors and more rapid technological change 
generally  the standard products market is a rapidly changing market in which the company faces the risk that  as the market changes  its product offerings will become obsolete 
the company competes in the standard products market with established companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to compete successfully in the standard products market or that it will be able to successfully introduce new standard products in the future 
the failure of the company to compete successfully in the standard products business would materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the analog semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in the analog market include product features  performance  price  timing of product introductions  emergence of new computer standards  quality and customer support 
because the standard products market for analog integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in its various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
due to the increasing demands for analog circuits  the company expects intensified competition from existing analog circuit suppliers and the entry of new competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that these existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that any of the company s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate the company s technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  and economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic conditions in asia or elsewhere 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition or results of operations 
readiness for year the company has and will continue to make certain investments in its software systems and applications to ensure the company is year compliant 
the financial impact to the company has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year
