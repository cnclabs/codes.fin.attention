item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general after five years of consistent growth in premiums written  both from internal growth and acquisitions  the company experienced little growth in direct premiums written and a decrease in net premiums written during during  the company focused on improving operating margins by emphasizing profitable lines  restructuring and reunderwriting marginal lines and discontinuing clearly unprofitable lines 
the company s efforts were rewarded with record operating earnings of million in as well as the continuation of a pattern of profitable quarters begun in the third quarter of when the phasing out of its prior non insurance operations was substantially completed 
the only exception to this pattern was a net loss of million in the third quarter of when the company strengthened loss reserves 
the company has pursued a strategy of focusing on selected niche businesses through acquisitions  new agency relationships and additions of key professional staff 
the company s most significant acquisition was its purchase in july of of the redland group  inc  a major writer of mpci and other crop insurance coverages 
in  the company was the third largest writer of mpci business in the united states 
mpci is a government sponsored program with accounting treatment which differs from more traditional property and casualty insurance lines 
for income statement purposes  gross premiums written consist of the aggregate amount of mpci premiums paid by farmers  and does not include any related federal premium subsidies or expense reimbursement 
the company s profit or loss from its mpci business is determined after the crop season ends on the basis of a profit sharing formula established by law and the rma 
for income statement purposes  any such profit share earned by the company  net of the cost of third party reinsurance  is shown as net premiums written  which equals net premiums earned for mpci business  whereas  any share of losses payable by the company is charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
due to various factors  including timing and severity of losses from storms and other natural perils and crop production cycles  the profit or loss on mpci premiums is primarily recognized in the second half of the calendar year 
the company relies on loss information from the field to determine utilizing a formula established by the rma the level of losses that should be considered in estimating the profit or loss during this period 
based upon available loss information  the company records an estimate of the profit or loss during the third quarter and then re evaluates the estimate using additional loss information available at year end to determine any remaining portion to be recorded in the fourth quarter 
all expense reimbursements received are credited to underwriting expenses 
certain characteristics of the company s crop business may affect comparisons  including i the seasonal nature of the business whereby profits or losses are generally recognized predominately in the second half of the year  ii the nature of crop business whereby losses are known within a short time period  and iii the limited amount of investment income associated with crop business 
in addition  cash flows from such business differ from cash flows from certain more traditional lines 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
the seasonal and short term nature of the company s crop business  as well as the impact on such business of weather and other natural perils  may produce more volatility in the company s operating results on a quarter to quarter or year to year basis than has historically been the case 
forward looking information except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  matters discussed herein may constitute forward looking information 
such forward looking information reflects the company s current best estimates regarding future operations  but  since these are only estimates  actual results may differ materially from such estimates 
a variety of events  most of which are outside the company s control  cannot be accurately predicted and may materially impact estimates of future operations 
important among such factors are weather conditions  natural disasters  changes in state and federal regulations  price competition impacting premium levels  changes in tax laws  financial market performance  changes in court decisions effecting coverages and general economic conditions 
the company s results are significantly impacted by its crop business  particularly its mpci line 
results from the crop lines are not generally known until the third and fourth quarters of the year  after crops are harvested 
crop results are particularly dependent on events beyond the company s control  notably weather conditions during the crop growing seasons in the states where the company writes a substantial amount of its crop insurance  and  with the introduction of the company s new crop revenue coverage  the market price of grains on various commodity exchanges 
additionally  federal regulations governing aspects of crop insurance are frequently modified  and any such changes may impact crop insurance results 
forward looking information set forth herein does not take into account any impact from any adverse weather conditions during the crop season  or the various other factors noted above which may affect crop and non crop operation results 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s net income increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the company s operating income increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  these improved results occurred despite a decrease in the company s insurance premiums earned and the differential between the growth in net income and operating income occurred as the company s tax rate returned to normal levels in after the company s taxes were positively affected by the decrease in the valuation allowance relating to the unrealized loss from the company s investment in major realty 
the improved results were attributed primarily to improved loss and expense ratios in all of the company s property and casualty divisions  excellent crop results resulting from an above average profit sharing earned in the company s mpci program  and increased investment income and realized gains from the company s investment portfolio 
these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio of the crop division  increased interest expense  and an increase in the company s effective tax rate 
after several years of growth in net insurance premiums earned  the company experienced a decline in net insurance premiums earned from million in to million in  a decline of approximately 
during  the company s goal in its property and casualty divisions was to improve underwriting results through an emphasis on profitable lines  a restructuring of marginal lines  and a discontinuation of unprofitable lines 
during this process  growth in profitable lines of business was offset by declining volumes in the discontinued lines resulting in only a 
increase in direct premiums written and a increase in gross premiums written 
in lines of business in which the company was seeking to improve marginal results  the company ceded additional amounts to reinsurers in order to reduce the impact of these lines as well as to help improve the net results of the company 
due to the competitive environment in the property and casualty business  new programs which the company initiated in were also heavily reinsured in order to diminish the impact on the company s results until such time as these new programs confirmed their expected level of profitability 
accordingly  the company increased its cessions to reinsurers by approximately million from million in to million during  resulting in a decline in net premiums written during as compared to in the company s crop division  the company s premium levels were also relatively flat as direct written premiums decreased from million in to million in and gross premiums increased slightly from million in to million in these relatively level written premiums resulted as increases in the company s policy count under the company s largest program  the mpci crop insurance program  were offset by reductions in commodity prices upon which the company s premiums are based 
underwriting results in all three of the company s property and casualty divisions improved during as compared to the company s general agency division experienced a million underwriting loss and a combined ratio of in the twelve months ended december  as compared to a million underwriting loss and a combined ratio of for the twelve months ended december  the general agency division s improved underwriting results were a result of a decrease in both the division s accident year and calendar year loss and loss adjustment expense ratios from to the division s loss and loss adjustment expense ratios fell from and on an accident and calendar year basis respectively during to and on an accident and calendar year basis respectively during these improved loss ratios were offset partially by an increase in the expense ratio of the division from during to during this increase in the expense ratio resulted from a decrease in net earned premiums from million during to million during with expenses remaining level at approximately million in both years 
the company s non standard auto division experienced its first unprofitable year in six years in as the division recorded a million underwriting loss and a combined ratio 
the division s performance improved to an underwriting loss of million and a combined ratio in during  the company continued a pattern of regular rate increases combined with the cancellation of unprofitable programs and agents and was able to improve its loss and loss adjustment expense ratio from in to in in addition  the division was able to increase its insurance premiums earned by while increasing expenses by only  helping to lower its expense ratio from in to in the company expects that profit improvement directives initiated in will continue to improve results within this division during the company also expects continued growth within this division during the year resulting in continued improvement in the division s expense ratio 
the program division improved from an underwriting loss of million and a combined ratio of during to an underwriting loss of million and a combined ratio of during these improved underwriting results were achieved by improvements of just over in both the expense and loss ratios of the division 
during  many of the new programs within the division were in a start up phase in which fixed expenses were not offset by adequate earned premiums 
during  growth in earned premium allowed fixed costs to move into a more normal relationship as a percentage of earned premiums  thus allowing the division to record a noticeable drop in its expense ratios from during to during the improvement in the loss ratio resulted from a change in the mix of business  emphasizing more profitable lines  restructuring of reinsurance to improve the company s net results and the discontinuation of programs and agents with unprofitable loss ratios 
the company expects continued improvement in the results of the program division as the benefit of the initiatives started in are realized in during  non automobile lines of business continued to outperform the automobile lines of business within the company s property and casualty divisions 
for the year  automobile lines recorded a combined ratio while non automobile lines recorded combined ratio 
the company continues to effect significant underwriting changes within its automobile lines in order to bring them closer to the company s desired goal of a combined ratio of or less 
the company s crop division was a significant contributor to the underwriting earnings of the company in both and during  the division contributed million to the company s underwriting earnings as compared to million during during  the company earned a profit share of on its mpci retained premium pool of approximately million or million 
this compares with an earned profit share of on a million retained premium pool generating million in during the first quarter of  the company s operating income benefited from a million profit in the company s crop division 
the principal component of this million was the recording of an additional million in profit sharing under the company s mpci program 
the company s estimate of its profit sharing under the mpci program at december  was affected by a volatile crop growing season during which many of the rules pertaining to preventive planting payments were changed and a combination of unusual weather conditions manifested themselves in an unusually late harvest 
as claims were closed during the first quarter of and the final preventive planting rules applied to these losses  the company was able to earn additional profit sharing 
the growing year did not experience this same degree of volatility  and the harvest was not delayed by unusual weather conditions 
consequently  the mpci profit sharing income recorded at december  more accurately estimated actual results than had the profit sharing recorded at december  during the first quarter of  the company experienced operating income of approximately  from the operations of its crop division 
the company believes that the crop results for the first quarter of were more typical of a normal year than those experienced in the first quarter of the improved profit sharing income in was offset by an increase in the company s net operating expenses under the mpci program 
this increase in net expenses was due to a decrease in expense reimbursement from the federal government under the mpci program from for both mpci and crop revenue coverage crc policies in to and respectively for mpci and crc policies in this resulted in an approximate million decrease in expense reimbursement from to the company was unable to pass along any of this expense reduction to its producing agents due to the competitive environment for mpci business during the company has initiated several automation and cost cutting programs in order to reduce its overall operating expense under the mpci program 
during  the expense reimbursement from the federal government under the mpci program declined again to for mpci policies and for crc policies 
further  the company expects an additional reduction for the crop year 
while the company continues to emphasize cost reduction and automation initiatives  the company will be unable to fully compensate for these reductions in expense reimbursements unless it is able to reduce agents commissions 
given the competitive environment for the mpci policies  it is unknown at this time whether the company will be able to effect such commission reductions without a loss of business in its mpci line 
the company s net income for also benefited from an increase in net investment income and net realized capital gains 
the company s net investment income increased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve month period ended december  while the company s net realized capital gains increased in as compared to the increase in the company s net investment income resulted from an increase in the average size of the company s portfolio from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase in the size of the portfolio was offset by a decrease in the annualized investment yield of the portfolio from during to during this decrease in annual investment yield was due to an increase in the average amount of tax advantaged securities within the company s portfolio and a lower interest rate environment during the company s interest expense increased from million during to million during this increase in interest expense resulted from both an increase in the company s average borrowings and the average interest rate paid by the company 
during  the company s average borrowings were million and the average interest rate was as compared to average borrowings in of million and an average interest rate of 
the increased borrowings during were used to add statutory surplus to the company s insurance company subsidiaries 
the increase in the company s average interest rate paid resulted from the issuance of million in trust preferred securities and the retirement of the company s outstanding bank debt during the third quarter of see discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
the company s taxes were positively effected by the decrease in the evaluation allowance related to the unrealized loss from the company s investment in major realty 
in october  major realty announced that its board of directors had determined that it was in the best interest of the stockholders to seek a merger partner  otherwise seek a transaction for the sale of the company 
at december   the company believed that the realization of the capital loss associated with such a transaction was more likely than not due to sufficient carryforwards of capital gains as well as the likelihood of future capital gains 
no such benefit was realized in  and therefore  the company s effective tax rate increased to a more normal level of as compared to an effective tax rate of in year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s net income increased approximately from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase in net income resulted from improved underwriting results in the company s crop and general agency divisions  growth in premium revenues  increased investment income and realized gains  and a decrease in the effective tax rate of the company 
these positive factors were offset by deteriorating results in the company s program division  increased interest expense  and a somewhat higher expense ratio for the company 
the combined underwriting loss and expense ratio improved from for the year ended december  to for the year 
this improvement in the company s combined ratio was enhanced by growth in net premiums earned of 
the greatest contribution to these improved underwriting results was made by the company s crop division 
the company s crop division increased its mpci writings from million for the year ended december  to million for the year 
in addition to this growth in mpci premium  the company increased its retained pool from million in to million in this growth in premium was aided by an increase in commodity prices for the major crops insured by the company and the introduction of an enhancement to the mpci policy 
improved weather conditions also contributed significantly to the improved results in the crop division as the company s mpci profit sharing percentage realized during increased to from realized during in addition  the year benefited from million of additional profit sharing realized in the first quarter of as final results of the late harvest were available 
underwriting results in the company s general agency division also improved in as compared to  as the company s combined ratio in this division improved from in to in the company s results were affected by a million strengthening of reserves for prior year losses  and million of the million affected the general agency division  contributing to the combined ratio recorded during when comparing accident year loss ratios for and in the general agency division  the results are similar 
in the year ended december   the general agency division accident year loss ratio was as compared to a accident year loss ratio of 
the general agency division was also able to improve its combined ratio through a reduction in expenses during as its expense ratio fell to in as compared to in the company also benefited from a increase in investment income during as compared to that of  and an increase in the realized investment gains of the company of when comparing the same periods 
the increase in investment income was principally due to an increase in the average size of the investment portfolio 
the average size of the company s investment portfolio increased by from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   while the pre tax yield on the portfolio increased from in to in the size of the company s investment portfolio increased from retained earnings and positive cash flows from operations 
while the company s income tax expense increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the year  the company s effective tax rate declined from in to in the company s taxes were positively effected by the decrease in the valuation allowance relating to the unrealized loss from the company s investment in major realty 
in october  major realty announced that its board of directors had determined that it was in the best interest of the stockholders to seek a merger partner or otherwise seek a transaction for the sale of the company 
at december   the company believed that the realization of the capital loss associated with such a transaction was more likely than not due to sufficient carryforwards of capital gains as well as the likelihood of further capital gains 
positive factors effecting net income were partially offset by deteriorating underwriting results in the company s program division 
the program division s combined loss and expense ratio increased from during to during a variety of factors combined to cause this deterioration in underwriting results 
in two of the division s departments  rural america and special products  weather related incidents increased the frequency of losses 
in the rural america department  storms in areas where the company had concentrations of farm business adversely effected the company s loss ratio  while in the company s special products department  prolonged sub zero temperatures in the greater chicago area increased the number and severity of freeze losses experienced in the company s condominium program 
the company has taken steps to reduce its geographic concentrations in the rural america department  and is making changes in the reinsurance structure of both of these departments in order to reduce volatility and improve net underwriting results 
additionally in the program division  the company changed its strategies within its workers compensation underwriting activities during in and previous years  the company had followed a strategy of depopulating assigned risk pools through the application of intensive case management techniques with risks which had become unacceptable to the standard market due to frequency rather than severity 
with the improvement of workers compensation results for the industry as a whole  more companies were willing to write workers compensation  and therefore  the number of risks fitting the company s profile for removal from assigned risk pools was substantially depleted 
during  the company moved to a strategy of partnership arrangements with select agencies in which the agent accepts part of the underwriting risk in return for an enhanced profit sharing from the company 
due to the competitive market  this strategy is developing slowly  and  thus  the company experienced a decrease in its direct written premiums in this line of business 
this transition phase caused the expense ratio in this line of business to increase more than  and resulted in an underwriting loss for this line of business 
offsetting these deteriorating results in the program division were improved results in the company s transportation department 
with the transportation department  the company s loss and expense ratio improved from during the year ended december  to during the company s non standard underwriting activities experienced unprofitable results for the first time in six years as a result of an increase in both the severity and frequency of losses  particularly in the area of physical damage losses 
the company has increased rates beginning in and continuing into  reduced commissions in certain areas with poor experience  and canceled agents with loss ratio problems 
the company s interest expense also increased during as compared to this increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the company s borrowings under its bank facility which increased from an average of million during to million during offsetting this increase in the size of borrowings was a decline in the average interest rate under the bank facility from during to during the additional borrowings under the bank facility were contributed to the company s subsidiaries in order to support underwriting activities and maintain capital adequacy ratios at a level commensurate with the company s current a rating by am best company 
the company experienced a somewhat higher expense ratio during than during this ratio increased from in to in primarily due to higher net commission expense in the program division of the company 
this higher net commission expense was a result of a changing mix of business with a lesser percentage of premiums produced in lower commission programs such as workers compensation and transportation and a higher percentage of premiums produced in higher commission lines of business 
in addition  the company decreased the use of quota share reinsurance within the program division during liquidity and capital resources the company has included a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources requirement of the company and the insurance subsidiaries 
the company parent only as an insurance holding company  the company s assets consist primarily of the capital stock of its subsidiaries  surplus notes issued by two of its insurance company subsidiaries and investments held at the holding company level 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are receipts from interest payments on the surplus notes  payments from the profit sharing agreement with american agrisurance  the company s wholly owned subsidiary which operates as the general agent for the company s crop insurance programs  tax sharing payments from its subsidiaries  investment income from  and proceeds from the sale of  holding company investments  and dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries of the company 
the company s liquidity needs are primarily to service debt  pay operating expenses and taxes  and make investments in subsidiaries 
the company currently holds three surplus notes  each in the amount of million  issued by two of its insurance company subsidiaries  bearing interest at the rate of per annum payable semi annually and quarterly 
although repayment of all or part of the principal of these surplus notes requires prior insurance department approval  no prior approval of interest payment is currently required 
under the american agrisurance profit sharing agreement  american agrisurance receives up to of the crop insurance profit after expenses and a margin retained by the insurance companies based upon a formula established by the company and approved by the nebraska department of insurance 
if the calculated profit share is negative  such negative amounts are carried forward and offset future profit sharing payments 
for the year ended december   american agrisurance recorded million  net of tax  related to the profit sharing agreement 
this entire amount was distributed in the form of a dividend to the company 
dividends from the insurance subsidiaries of the company are regulated by the regulatory authorities of the states in which each subsidiary is domiciled 
the laws of such states generally restrict dividends from insurance companies to parent companies to certain statutorily approved limits 
in  the statutory limitation on dividends from insurance company subsidiaries to the parent without further insurance departmental approval is approximately million 
the company is currently a party to a tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries  under which such subsidiaries pay the company amounts in general equal to the federal income tax that would be payable by such subsidiaries on a stand alone basis 
in august  aici capital trust  a delaware business trust organized by the company the issuer trust issued million shares or million aggregate liquidation amount of its preferred securities liquidation amount per preferred security 
the company owns all of the common securities the common securities of the issue trust 
the preferred securities represent preferred undivided beneficial interests in the issuer trust s assets 
the assets of the issuer trust consist solely of the company s junior subordinated debentures due which were issued in august of in an amount equal to the preferred securities and the common securities 
the company primarily used the net proceeds in the amount of million from the sale of the junior subordinated debentures to pay down the million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
distributions on the preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures are cumulative  accrue from the date of issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears 
the junior subordinated debentures are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of the company and are subject to certain events of default and redemptive provisions  all described in the junior debenture indenture 
at december   the company had million outstanding at a weighted annual interest cost of 
on june   the company amended its borrowing arrangements with its bank lenders providing a five year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  with a final maturity of  in amounts not to exceed million 
in august  the company used the net proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures to repay the company s outstanding indebtedness of million under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the junior subordinated debentures  the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million 
the company selects its interest rate as either the prime rate or libor plus a margin which varies depending on the company s funded debt to equity ratio 
interest is payable quarterly 
at december   the company had no outstanding indebtedness under this arrangement 
borrowings and interest cost averaged million and during the revolving credit facility contains covenants which do not permit the payment of dividends by the company  requires the company to maintain certain operating and debt service coverage ratios  required maintenance of specified levels of surplus and requires the company to meet certain tests established by the regulatory authorities 
as of december   the company held cash  invested assets excluding investments in subsidiaries  and dividends receivable of million 
insurance companies the principal liquidity needs of the insurance companies are to fund losses and loss adjustment expense payments and to pay underwriting expenses  including commissions and other expenses 
the available sources to fund these requirements are net premiums received and  to a lesser extent  cash flows from the company s investment activities  which together have been adequate to meet such requirements on a timely basis 
the company monitors the cash flows of the insurance companies and attempts to maintain sufficient cash to meet current operating expenses  and to structure its investment portfolio at a duration which approximates the estimated cash requirements for the payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses 
cash flows from the company s mpci and crop hail businesses differ in certain respects from cash flows associated with more traditional property and casualty lines 
mpci premiums are not received from farmers until the covered crops are harvested  and when received are promptly remitted by the company in full to the government 
covered losses are paid by the company during the growing season as incurred  with such expenditures reimbursed by the government within three business days 
policy acquisition and administration expenses are paid by the company as incurred during the year 
the company periodically throughout the year receives a payment in reimbursement of its policy acquisition and administration expenses 
the company s profit or loss from its mpci business is determined after the crop season ends on the basis of a profit sharing formula established by law and the rma 
commencing with the year  the company receives a profit share in cash  with of the amount in excess of of its mpci retention as defined in the profit sharing agreement in any year carried forward to future years  or it must pay its share of losses 
prior to the year  the amount carried forward to future years was any amount in excess of of its mpci retention 
the company recognized million in profit sharing earned on the mpci business during  and in addition  recognized million during in profit sharing earned on mpci business 
with the change in profit sharing payment rules including amounts payable for the crop year  the company received million in payments under the mpci program in february of in the crop hail insurance business  premiums are generally not received until after the harvest  while losses and other expenses are paid throughout the year 
changes in financial condition the naic has established a risk based capital rbc formula for property and casualty insurance companies 
the rbc initiative is designed to enhance the current regulatory framework for the evaluation of the capital adequacy of a property and casualty insurer 
the formula requires an insurer to compute the amount of capital necessary to support four areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers a asset risk default on fixed income assets and market decline  b credit risk losses from unrecoverable reinsurance and inability to collect agents balances and other receivables  c underwriting risk premium pricing and reserve estimates  and d off balance sheet growth risk excessive premium growth and unreported liabilities 
the insurance companies have reviewed and applied the rbc formula for the year and have exceeded these requirements 
the company s stockholders equity increased by approximately million from december  to december  the principal components of this increase were net income of million for the year ended and an increase in the value of the company s investment portfolio causing the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities net of tax to improve from a loss of million to a gain of million 
consolidated cash flows cash flows from operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to cash flows from operating activities of million during the decrease in positive cash flows is a result of a decline in the growth of gross written premiums coupled with a higher percentage of gross written premiums ceded to reinsurers 
cash flows from the company s mpci and crop hail business are different in certain respects from cash flows associated with more traditional property and casualty lines see liquidity and capital resources  insurance companies 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs which recognize only two digits rather than four to identify the year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date of as the year rather than the year if not corrected  this could cause computer systems to fail or perform miscalculations 
the company has identified the computer system applications that require modification to be year compliant 
the company has developed a corrective plan whereby internal and external resources are being utilized to make the necessary modifications to and testing of the company s computer systems 
while some of the company s computer systems are currently year compliant  management expects the remaining systems to be year compliant by december  the company has expensed costs relating to the year issue of approximately million in and anticipates an additional to million of expenses to complete the project 
the estimated costs and estimated date of completion of the year project is based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from the company s plan 
in addition  the company is communicating with others with which it does business to determine if they are year compliant 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of these companies will achieve year compliance in a timely manner
