item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit research and development selling expenses general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net of interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income in its remanufacturing operations  the company obtains used alternators and starters  commonly known as cores  from its customers as trade ins and by purchasing them from vendors 
such trade ins are recorded when cores are received from customers 
credits for cores are allowed only against purchases of similar remanufactured products and generally are used within days of issuance by the customer 
due to this trade in policy  the company does not reserve for trade ins 
in addition  since it is unlikely that a customer will not utilize its trade in credits  the credit is recorded when the core is returned as opposed to when the customer purchases new products 
the company believes that this policy is consistent throughout the remanufacturing and rebuilding industry 
beginning with fiscal  the company implemented a new accounting presentation with respect to its reporting of sales 
in the past  the company deducted the value of all cores returned from its customers in order to reach net sales 
under the new presentation  net sales are reported on a gross basis  that is core returns from customers are not deducted in order to reach net sales  but rather are included in cost of goods sold

the company believes that this new presentation provides a truer depiction of actual sales and cost of goods sold and reflects a more proper relationship between sales and inventory
