item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s principal operating subsidiary is foothill independent bank  a california state chartered bank the bank  which accounts for substantially all of the company s revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the operations and financial condition of the bank 
net interest income net interest income is a principal determinant of a bank s income 
net interest income represents the difference or spread between the interest earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities which in the case of the company  consist principally of deposits 
net interest income was substantially the same in  as compared to  as a  decline in interest income was offset by a  decrease in interest expense 
the decline in interest income was due primarily to a decrease of  in interest and fees earned on loans that was partially offset by increases in interest earned on investment securities and federal funds sold aggregating  see years ended december  and interest income 
the decrease in interest expense in resulted primarily from a reduction in the average volume of outstanding tcd s 
in  net interest income increased by approximately  or due primarily to the combined effects of an increase in interest income and a decline in interest paid on tcd s 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the average volume of loans outstanding during and the decline in interest expense was primarily attributable to a decline in the average volume of outstanding tcd s 
rate sensitivity and effect on net interest income a bank s net interest income is affected by a number of factors including the relative percentages or the mix of i variable and fixed rate loans in its loan portfolio and ii demand and savings deposits  on the one hand  and time deposits including tcd s  on the other hand 
as a general rule  a bank with a relatively high percentage of fixed rate loans will experience a decline in interest income during a period of increasing market rates of interest  because it will be unable to reprice its fixed rate loans to offset fully the increase in the rates of interest it must offer to retain maturing time deposits and attract new deposits 
similarly  a bank with a high percentage of tcd s in relation to its total deposits generally will experience greater increases in interest expense  and therefore  a decrease in net interest income  during periods of increasing market rates of interest than a bank with a greater percentage of demand and savings deposits which are less sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
by contrast  during a period of declining market rates of interest  a bank with a higher percentage of variable loans  as a general rule  will experience a decline in net interest income because such loans usually contain automatic repricing provisions that are triggered by declines in market rates of interest  whereas offsetting reductions in the rates of interest paid on tcd s cannot be implemented until they mature  at which time a bank can seek their renewal at lower rates of interest or allow such deposits to terminate or run off in order to reduce interest expense 
the bank attempts to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and thereby at least to maintain and  if possible  to increase its net interest margin or spread by seeking i to attract and maintain a significant volume of demand and savings deposits that bear interest at rates that are lower  and that are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  than tcd s  and ii to match opportunities to reprice earning assets  in response to changes in market rates of interest which require or cause repricing of deposits 
beginning in the second half of  the bank s management elected to allow some of its maturing tcd s to run off and commenced marketing programs designed to attract additional demand and savings deposits 
as a result of these efforts  during  the average volume of demand and savings including money market deposits increased by  or and  at december   such deposits represented of the bank s total deposits as compared to at december  at the same time  the average volume of tcd s  on which the bank pays interest at its highest rates  declined by  or 
overall  the bank s net interest margin ie  net interest income stated as a percentage of interest income increased somewhat to in from in  and in the ability of the bank to maintain its net interest margin is not entirely within its control because the interest rates and fees that the bank is able to charge on loans  and the interest rates it must offer to maintain and attract deposits  are affected by national monetary policies established by the federal reserve board and by competitive conditions in the bank s market areas 
in addition  the effect on a bank s net interest margins of changes in market rates of interest will depend on the types and maturities of its deposits and earning assets 
for example  a reduction in interest rates paid on deposits in response to declines in market rates of interest can be implemented more quickly in the case of savings deposits and money market accounts than with respect to time deposits as to which a change in interest rates generally cannot be implemented until such deposits mature 
in addition  a change in rates of interest paid on deposits may lead consumers to move their deposits from one type of deposit to another or to shift funds from deposits to non bank investments or from such investments to bank deposit accounts or instruments  which also will affect a bank s net interest margin 
in  market rates of interest stabilized  but at the same time competition among banks and other commercial lending institutions increased 
the bank responded to these conditions by lowering interest rates and fees on loans and making an increased number of fixed rate loans 
these actions were predicated  in large part  on the relative stability of the interest rate markets and the bank s success in increasing the volume of less volatile demand and savings deposits and reducing the volume of tcd s  which enabled the bank to maintain its net interest income and achieve a modest increase in its net interest margin  despite the lowering of interest rates and loan fees 
the increase in the volume of fixed rate loans does expose the bank to the potential risk of a decline in net interest income in the event market rates of interest were to increase significantly in future periods 
however  management believes that the bank s higher percentage of lower cost and less volatile demand and savings deposits  coupled with increases that occurred in in the volume of investments and deposits held at other banking institutions  will operate to mitigate any adverse effects that an increase in market rates of interest would otherwise have on the bank s net interest income 
the bank currently anticipates a relatively stable net interest margin for based on a number of factors  including i the expectation that interest rate markets in the united states will remain relatively stable  ii the expectation that there will be increased loan growth in as a result of stable interest rates  an improving economy in southern california and new marketing programs being instituted by the bank  and iii the bank s decision to continue allowing higher interest bearing tcd s to run off as they mature in however  competition for new loans is expected to continue to be intense  which will have the effect of limiting the ability of the bank  as well as other lending institutions  to increase interest rates on loans and there is no assurance that expectations regarding economic conditions in will prove to be correct 
see  forward looking statements and uncertainties about future performance 
years ended december  and interest income interest income consists of interest and fees earned on outstanding loans  interest on funds held on deposit at other banks and on federal funds sold and income on investments  which consist principally of government securities 
in  interest and fee income from loans declined by  or primarily as a result of increased competition among banks and other lending institutions in the bank s market areas  which led the bank to lower interest rates and fees on the loans it made in and which resulted in a slowing of the growth of new loans during the second half of the decrease in interest and fees on loans was partially offset by increases in interest income earned on investment securities and on federal funds sold of  and  respectively  due primarily to increases in the volume of such investments 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or in as compared to  as reductions in the average volume of tcd s and somewhat lower interest rates largely offset an increase in interest expense attributable to increases in the average volume of savings and money market deposits and other time deposits 
provision for loan and lease losses the bank follows the practice of maintaining a reserve for possible losses on loans and leases that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
write offs of loans essentially reductions in the carrying values of non performing loans due to possible losses on their ultimate recovery are charged against this reserve the loan loss reserve  which is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans and in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or changes in general economic conditions 
additions to the loan loss reserve are made through a charge against income referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses 
during the bank made provisions totaling  compared to  during and  at december  the loan loss reserve was approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding  compared to approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  the decrease in the total of the additions made to the loan loss reserve in was attributable to declines in the rate of growth in total loans and in the total number of non performing assets in as compared to net loan charge offs for aggregated  representing forty three hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding  as compared to net loan charge offs in of  which represented thirty nine one hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding 
the bank s non performing loans  which consist primarily of loans for which there have been no payments of principal or interest for more than days  totaled approximately  or of total loans at december   as compared to  or of total loans at december  and  or of total loans at december  the ratio of the bank s loan loss reserve to non performing loans was at december   as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
other income other income increased by  or in compared to  primarily as a result of i increases in transaction fees and service charges that were the result of increases in the volume of total deposits and other banking transactions  and ii gains on the sale of certain sba loans 
other expense non interest expense  consists primarily of i salaries and other employee expenses  ii occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses  and iii other operating and miscellaneous expenses that include insurance premiums  marketing expenses  data processing costs and charges that are periodically made against income to establish reserves for possible losses on the disposition of real properties acquired on or in lieu of foreclosure of defaulted loans commonly referred to as other real estate owned or oreo 
non interest expense increased by approximately  or in compared to contributing to that increase were expenses associated with a bank wide data processing system conversion  which was completed during the second quarter of while the increase in the total dollar amount of non interest expense was  as a percentage of operating income net interest income plus other income the increase in non interest expense was  increasing from in to in income taxes income taxes increased by approximately  or during compared to  primarily as a result of the combined effects of an increase in pre tax income  and a decrease of in the overall tax rate  in years ended december  and interest income the increase in interest income of approximately  or in compared to was due primarily to an increase of  or in interest and fees earned on loans that was attributable to an increase in the average volume of the bank s outstanding loans 
the increase in interest and fee income attributable to increased loan volume more than offset the effects on interest income of a decrease in the average volume of federal funds sold  which were reduced to fund new loans and a planned reduction or run off of tcd s 
interest expense interest expense increased by less than in  as reductions in the average volume of tcd s and slightly lower interest rates largely offset an increase in interest expense attributable to increases in the volume of savings and money market deposits 
provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses made in totaled  compared to  for net loan charge offs for aggregated  representing thirty nine hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding  as compared to net loan charge offs in of  which represented sixty one hundredths of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding 
other income other income increased by  or in compared to  primarily as a result of increases in transaction fees and service charges that were attributable to increases in the volume of total deposits and other banking transactions 
other expense the bank s non interest expense increased by approximately  or in compared to this increase included a  increase in salaries and employee benefits and a  increase in occupancy expenses that were primarily attributable to internal growth in the bank s assets and operations 
income taxes income taxes increased by approximately  or during compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in pre tax income achieved in financial condition the company s total assets at december  were approximately  or  higher than at december  average total assets for increased by approximately  to  from  for these increases were primarily the result of new loan volume and increases in other interest earning assets  principally cash and balances due from other banks  investment securities and federal funds sold 
the average volume of loans and leases less reserves outstanding during increased by approximately  or compared however  during the second half of  the average volume of loans outstanding increased by only  or 
the average volume of the bank s investment securities during increased by approximately  or compared to figures 
the average volume of federal funds sold increased by to  in from  in these increases were offset by a reduction in the average volume of interest bearing deposits held at other financial institutions during to  from an average volume of  in beginning in  the bank initiated new marketing programs designed to increase the volume of demand  savings and money market deposits  which are either non interest bearing or bear interest at rates which are substantially lower than those paid on time deposits 
at the same time  management began reducing the interest rates it offered on tcd s to discourage renewals of existing and purchases of new tcd s by customers and  thereby  reduce the volume of those deposits at the bank 
as a result  at december   the volume of demand deposits and savings deposits at the bank was  higher than at december  and non interest bearing demand deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  had increased to from at december  by contrast the volume of tcd s outstanding at december  was  or  lower than at december  the company currently anticipates that there will be modest growth in the bank s total assets in  which is expected to result from increased lending and deposit activity generated by new marketing programs being instituted by the bank 
liquidity management liquidity management policies attempt to achieve a matching of sources and uses of funds in order to enable the bank to fund its customers requirements for loans and deposit withdrawals 
in conformity with those policies  the bank maintains short term sources of funds to meet periodic increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
at december   the principal source of liquidity consisted of  in cash and demand balances due from banks and  of federal funds sold which  together  totaled  as compared to  at december  other sources of liquidity include  in securities available for sale  of which approximately  of such securities mature within one year and  in interest bearing deposits at other financial institutions  which mature in six months or less 
the bank also has established facilities to borrow federal funds from other banks that total  and has an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank in the amount of  furthermore  substantially all of the bank s installment loans and leases  the amount of which aggregated  at december   require regular installment payments  providing a steady flow of cash funds to the bank 
accordingly  the company believes that the bank has adequate cash and cash equivalent resources to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
capital resources it is the policy of the board of directors to retain earnings to support the growth of the bank rather than to pay cash dividends 
those earnings were used to open two new banking offices during  and a third office in march of the company is evaluating opportunities to expand the bank s market coverage into areas such as eastern los angeles county  western san bernardino county  north orange county and north riverside county  all of which are contiguous to the bank s existing markets and  subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals  intends to open an additional banking office in one of these areas either late in or early in during the second quarter of the company declared its third stock dividend in three years  which was distributed on june  and for accounting purposes was recorded as a  reduction in retained earnings  offset by a corresponding  increase in the company s stated capital 
as a result of the increase in and the retention of earnings in  the company s total shareholders equity increased by approximately  or to  at december  from  at december  net earnings in represent a return on beginning assets that is  total assets as of january  of and a return on beginning equity total shareholders equity as of january  of 
at december   the bank s tier capital ratio was compared to at december   and as of those same respective dates  the bank s tier risk based capital ratios were and  and its total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by weighting the bank s assets in accordance with certain risk factors and  the higher the risk profile of a bank s assets  the greater is the amount of capital that is required to maintain an adequate risk based capital ratio  which generally is at least 
the bank s tier capital and risk based capital ratios compare favorably with other peer group banks 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on preliminary information  it is currently believed that the costs of addressing potential problems will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity in future periods 
however  if the company is unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
however  even if the company is able to resolve any such issues with respect to its computerized information systems  there is no assurance that customers who utilize computer information systems to effectuate banking transactions  or the company s vendors or financial institutions with which the company does business  will not encounter problems that could adversely affect the company s business 
forward looking information and uncertainties regarding future performance this annual report  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking information  which reflects management s current views of the company s future financial performance 
the forward looking information is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the following increased competition 
increased competition from other financial institutions  mutual funds and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive loan and investment products  could require the bank to reduce interest rates and loan fees to attract new loans or to increase interest rates that it offers on time deposits in order to retain existing or attract new deposits  either or both of which could  in turn  reduce interest income and net interest margins 
possible adverse changes in economic conditions 
adverse changes in local economic conditions could i reduce loan demand which could  in turn  reduce interest income and net interest margins  ii adversely affect the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to the bank which  in turn  could result in increases in loan losses and require increases in reserves for possible loan losses  thereby adversely affecting earnings  and iii lead to reductions in real property values that  due to the bank s reliance on real property to secure many of its loans  could make it more difficult for the bank to prevent potential losses on non performing loans through the sale of such real properties 
possible adverse changes in national economic conditions and frb monetary policies 
changes in national economic conditions  such as increases in inflation or declines in economic output often prompt changes in federal reserve board monetary policies that could increase the cost of funds to the bank and reduce net interest margins  particularly if the bank is unable  due to competitive pressures or the rate insensitivity of earning assets  to effectuate commensurate increases in the rates it is able to charge for new loans 
changes in regulatory policies 
changes of federal and state bank regulatory policies  such as increases in capital requirements or in loan loss reserves  or changes in asset liability ratios  could adversely affect earnings by reducing yields on earning assets or increasing operating costs 
effects of growth 
it is the intention of the company to take advantage of opportunities to increase the bank s business  either through acquisitions of other banks or the establishment of new banking offices 
if the bank does acquire any other banks or opens any additional banking offices  it is likely to incur additional operating costs that may adversely affect the company s operating results  at least on an interim basis until any acquired bank is integrated into the company s operations or the new banking office achieves profitability 
year the costs of resolving the year problems could prove to be greater than is currently anticipated or efforts to resolve such problems in a timely manner could prove to be unsuccessful 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report  or to make predictions based solely on historical financial performance
