the securities portfolio on december  consisted of securities held for investment totaling billion and securities available for sale totaling billion compared to billion and billion  respectively  on december  the increase in available for sale securities reflects initiatives to invest excess capital in the securities portfolio and the impact of approximately billion of mortgage backed securities obtained principally through residential mortgage loans that were securitized and retained primarily during the third quarter of also contributing to the increase in available for sale securities since december  was the purchase of higher yielding mortgage backed securities in the first quarter of on december   the market value of the corporation s securities held for investment reflected net unrealized appreciation of million 
on december   the market value of the corporation s portfolio of securities held for investment approximated the book value of the portfolio 
the valuation allowance for securities available for sale and marketable equity securities increased shareholders equity by million on december   reflecting pretax appreciation of million on marketable equity securities and million on debt securities 
the valuation allowance increased shareholders equity by million on december  the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates when comparing december  to december   but also reflected the impact of higher securities balances 
the estimated average maturities of securities held for investment and securities available for sale portfolios were years and years  respectively  on december  compared to years and years  respectively  on december  the decrease in the average expected maturity of the available for sale portfolio is attributable to purchases of securities during with shorter average maturities than the weighted average maturities of securities owned on december  loans and leases total loans and leases increased approximately percent to billion on december  compared to billion on december  as presented in table three  average total loans and leases increased percent to billion in compared to billion in due primarily to the impact of the boatmen s acquisition and core loan growth  partially offset by the impact of billion of securitizations  most of which occurred during the third quarter of average commercial loans increased to billion in compared to billion in  due largely to the boatmen s acquisition and core loan growth  partially offset by the impact of a billion commercial loan securitization that occurred during the third quarter of average real estate commercial and construction loans increased to billion in as a result of the addition of boatmen s 
excluding the boatmen s acquisition  real estate commercial and construction loans decreased  reflecting the corporation s efforts to lower its exposure to this line of business 
average residential mortgage loans increased percent to billion in compared to billion in  mainly the result of the boatmen s acquisition as well as core loan growth 
the increase in mortgage loans was partially offset by the impact of billion of mortgage loan securitizations which occurred primarily during the third quarter of average credit card and other consumer loans  including direct and indirect consumer loans and home equity loans  increased billion  primarily the result of the boatmen s acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by million of other consumer loan securitizations 
a significant source of liquidity for the corporation is the repayment and maturities of loans 
table seven shows selected loan maturity data on december  and indicates that approximately percent of the selected loans had maturities of one year or less 
the securitization and sale of certain loans and the use of loans as collateral in asset backed financing arrangements are also sources of liquidity

also during  the corporation issued approximately billion in long term senior and subordinated debt  including billion which was issued under its medium term note program and billion under a bank note program 
see note six to the consolidated financial statements on page for further details on long term debt

capital resources and capital management shareholders equity on december  was billion compared to billion on december  the acquisition of boatmen s resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock and an increase of billion in total shareholders equity 
the increase was partially offset by the repurchase of approximately million shares of common stock for billion 
the corporation s and its significant banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios  along with a description of the components of risk based capital  capital adequacy requirements and prompt corrective action provisions  are included in note nine to the consolidated financial statements on page market risk management in the normal course of conducting its business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risk which includes both price and liquidity risk 
price risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices that may result in changes in the market values of financial instruments 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the corporation may not be able to satisfy current and future financial commitments or that the corporation may not be able to liquidate financial instruments at market prices 
risk management procedures and policies have been established and are utilized to manage the corporation s exposure to market risk 
the strategy of the corporation with respect to market risk is to maximize net income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk to changes in market rates 
while achievement of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and market price risk  there are opportunities to enhance revenues through controlled risks 
in implementing strategies to manage interest rate risk  the primary tools used by the corporation are its securities portfolio and interest rate contracts  and management of the mix  yields or rates and maturities of assets and of the wholesale and retail funding sources of the corporation 
market risk is managed by the corporation s finance committee which formulates policy based on desirable levels of market risk 
in setting desirable levels of market risk  the finance committee considers the impact on both earnings and capital of the current outlook in market rates  potential changes in market rates  world and regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
in january  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted new rules that require more comprehensive disclosures of accounting policies for derivatives as well as enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk for derivative and other financial instruments 
the market risk disclosures must be presented for most financial instruments  which must be classified into two portfolios financial instruments entered into for trading purposes and all other covered financial instruments non trading portfolio 
for a discussion of non trading  on balance sheet financial instruments see table nine in the following market risk management section on page for information on market risk associated with asset and liability management alm activities  see the following discussion on page of the market risk management section and the mortgage banking section of noninterest income on page as well as the mortgage servicing rights section in note one to the consolidated financial statements on page market risk associated with the trading portfolio is discussed in the following market risk management section on page the composition of the trading portfolio and related fair values are included in note four to the consolidated financial statements on page derivatives dealer positions and related credit risk are presented in note eight to the consolidated financial statements on page accounting policies for alm and trading derivatives are disclosed in note one to the consolidated financial statements in the trading instruments and risk management instruments sections on pages and  respectively 
non trading portfolio the corporation s alm process is used to manage interest rate risk through the structuring of balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios and identifying and linking such off balance sheet positions to specific assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk represents the only material market risk exposure to the corporation s non trading on balance sheet financial instruments 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations which determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  securities  loans  deposits  borrowings and off balance sheet financial instruments 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by executive management 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are selectively utilized where they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
on december   the interest rate risk position of the corporation was relatively neutral as the impact of a gradual parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months when compared to stable rates was estimated to be less than percent of net income 
table nine summarizes the expected maturities  unrealized gains and losses and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with the corporation s significant non trading  on balance sheet financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  time deposits placed and other short term investments  fed funds sold and purchased  resale and repurchase agreements  commercial paper  other short term borrowings and foreign deposits  which are similar in nature to other short term borrowings  are excluded from table nine as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market 
however  these financial instruments can expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
loans held for sale are also excluded as their carrying values approximate their fair values  generally exposing the corporation to insignificant market risk

expected maturities are based on contractual maturities 
when measuring and managing market risk associated with domestic deposits  the corporation considers its long term relationships with depositors 
the unrealized loss on domestic deposits in this table does not consider these long term relationships 
expected maturities of long term debt and trust preferred securities reflect the corporation s ability to redeem such debt prior to contractual maturities 
risk management interest rate contracts are utilized in the alm process 
such contracts  which are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps and options  allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
as reflected in table ten  the total gross notional amount of the corporation s alm interest rate swaps on december  was billion  with the corporation receiving fixed on billion  primarily converting variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate  and receiving variable on billion 
the net receive fixed position of billion on december  was essentially unchanged from december  in addition  the corporation has billion of basis swaps linked primarily to long term debt 
table ten also summarizes the expected maturities  weighted average pay and receive rates and the unrealized gains and losses on december  of the corporation s alm interest rate contracts 
floating rates represent the last repricing and will change in the future primarily based on movements in one  three and six month libor rates 
the net unrealized appreciation of the alm swap portfolio on december  was million compared to net unrealized appreciation of million on december   reflecting a decrease in interest rates when comparing december  to december  the amount of net realized deferred gains associated with terminated alm swaps was million on december  compared to million of net realized deferred losses on december  to manage interest rate risk  the corporation also utilizes interest rate option products  primarily caps and floors 
interest rate caps and floors are agreements where  for a fee  the purchaser obtains the right to receive interest payments when a variable interest rate moves above or below a specified cap or floor rate  respectively 
on december   the corporation had a gross notional amount of billion in outstanding interest rate option contracts used for alm purposes compared to billion on december  such instruments are primarily linked to long term debt  short term borrowings and pools of similar residential mortgages and consist mainly of purchased options 
on december   the net unrealized depreciation of alm option products was million compared to net unrealized appreciation of million on december  the amount of net realized deferred gains associated with terminated alm options was million on december  compared to million of net realized deferred gains on december  in addition  the corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated liabilities 
foreign currency contracts involve the conversion of certain scheduled interest and principal payments denominated in foreign currencies 
on december   these contracts had a notional value of billion and a net market value of negative million 
the net unrealized appreciation in the estimated value of the alm interest rate and net negative market value in the alm foreign exchange portfolios should be viewed in the context of the overall balance sheet 
the value of any single component of the balance sheet or off balance sheet positions should not be viewed in isolation

each major trading site is monitored by this risk management unit 
risk limits have been approved by the corporation s finance committee  and daily earnings at risk limits are generally allocated to the business units 
in addition to limits placed on these individual business units  limits are also imposed on the risks individual traders can take and on the amount of risk that can be concentrated in a particular product or market 
risk positions are monitored by business unit  risk management personnel and senior management on a daily basis 
business unit and risk management personnel are responsible for continual monitoring of the changing aggregate position of the portfolios under their responsibility  including projection of the profit or loss levels that could result from both normal and extreme market moves 
if any market risk limits are inadvertently exceeded  the risk management unit ensures that actions are taken as necessary to bring portfolios within approved trading limits 
to estimate potential losses that could result from adverse market movements  the factor based scenario model is used to calculate daily earnings at risk 
this model breaks down yield curve movements into three underlying factors to produce sixteen yield curve scenarios used to estimate hypothetical profit or loss 
earnings at risk represents a one day measurement of pretax earnings at risk from movements in market prices using the assumption that positions cannot be rehedged during the period of any prescribed price and volatility change 
a percent confidence level is utilized  which indicates that actual trading profits and losses may deviate from expected levels and exceed estimates approximately one day out of every days of trading activity 
earnings at risk estimates are measured on a daily basis at the individual trading unit level  by type of trading activity and for all trading activities in the aggregate 
daily reports of estimates compared to respective limits are reviewed by senior management  and trading strategies are adjusted accordingly 
in addition to the earnings at risk analysis  portfolios which have significant option positions are stress tested continually to simulate the potential loss that might occur due to unexpected market movements 
earnings at risk is measured on both a gross and uncorrelated basis 
the gross measure assumes that adverse market movements occur simultaneously across all segments of the trading portfolio  an unlikely assumption 
on december   the gross estimates for aggregate interest rate  foreign exchange and equity and commodity trading activities were million  million and million  respectively 
alternately  using a statistical measure which is more likely to capture the effects of market movements  the uncorrelated estimate on december  for aggregate trading activities was million 
both measures indicate that the corporation s primary risk exposure is related to its interest rate activities 
average daily trading revenues in approximated million 
during  the corporation s trading activities resulted in positive daily revenues for approximately percent of total trading days 
during  the standard deviation of trading revenues was million 
using this data  one can conclude that the aggregate trading activities should not result in exposure of more than million for any one day  assuming percent confidence 
when comparing daily earnings at risk to trading revenues  daily earnings at risk will average considerably more due to the assumption of no corrective actions as well as the assumption that adverse market movements occur simultaneously across all segments of the trading portfolio 
instruments included in the corporation s trading portfolio including derivatives dealer positions and their fair values are disclosed in notes four and eight of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages and  respectively 
credit risk management and credit portfolio review in conducting business activities  the corporation is exposed to the possibility that borrowers or counterparties may default on their obligations to the corporation 
credit risk arises through the extension of loans  leases  factored accounts receivable  certain securities  letters of credit  financial guarantees and through counterparty risk on trading and capital markets transactions 
to manage this risk  the credit policy group establishes policies and procedures to manage both on and off balance sheet credit risk and communicates and monitors the application of these policies and procedures throughout the corporation 
the corporation s overall objective in managing credit risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of occurrences 
to achieve this objective  the corporation strives to maintain a credit risk profile that is diverse in terms of product type  industry concentration  geographic distribution and borrower or counterparty concentration 
the credit policy group works with lending officers  trading personnel and various other line personnel in areas that conduct activities involving credit risk and is involved in the implementation  refinement and monitoring of credit policies and procedures 
the corporation manages credit exposure to individual borrowers and counterparties on an aggregate basis including loans  leases  factored accounts receivable  securities  letters of credit  bankers acceptances  derivatives and unfunded commitments 
the creditworthiness of a borrower or counterparty is determined by experienced personnel  and limits are established for the total credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty 
credit limits are subject to varying levels of approval by senior line and credit policy management 
total exposure to a borrower or counterparty is aggregated and measured against established limits 
the originating credit officer assigns borrowers or counterparties an initial risk rating which is based on the amount of inherent credit risk and reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit policy personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit policy personnel for deterioration in a borrower s or counterparty s financial condition which would impact the ability of the borrower or counterparty to perform under the contract 
risk ratings are adjusted as necessary 
for consumer lending  credit scoring systems are utilized to provide standards for extension of credit 
consumer portfolio credit risk is monitored primarily using statistical models and actual payment experience to predict portfolio behavior 
when required  the corporation obtains collateral to support credit extensions and commitments 
generally  such collateral is in the form of real and personal property  cash on deposit or other highly liquid instruments 
in certain circumstances  the corporation obtains real property as security for some loans that are made on the general creditworthiness of the borrower and whose proceeds were not used for real estate related purposes 
the corporation also manages exposure to a single borrower  industry  product type or other concentration through syndications of credits  participations  loan sales and securitizations 
through global finance  the corporation is a major participant in the syndications market 
in a syndicated facility  each participating lender funds only its portion of the syndicated facility  therefore limiting its exposure to the borrower 
the corporation also identifies and reduces its exposure to funded borrower  product or industry concentrations through loan sales 
generally  these sales are without recourse to the corporation 
in conducting derivatives activities in certain jurisdictions  the corporation reduces credit risk to any one counterparty through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements which allow the corporation to settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty on a net basis 
for more information on the corporation s off balance sheet credit risk  see note eight to the consolidated financial statements on page an independent credit review group conducts ongoing reviews of credit activities and portfolios  reexamining on a regular basis risk assessments for credit exposures and overall compliance with policy

ratio of the allowance for credit losses on december to net charge offs allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans excluding increases that resulted from the acquisition of boatmen s  management expects charge offs in general to increase modestly in  with increases in the consumer loan categories anticipated as the corporation continues its efforts to shift the mix of the loan portfolio to a higher consumer loan concentration 
furthermore  future economic conditions also will impact credit quality and may result in increased net charge offs and higher provision for credit losses 
portions of the allowance for credit losses are allocated to cover the estimated losses inherent in particular risk categories of loans 
the allocation of the allowance for credit losses  as presented in table twelve  is based upon the corporation s loss experience over a period of years and is adjusted for existing economic conditions as well as performance trends within specific portfolio segments and individual concentrations of credit 
the nature of the process by which the corporation determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses is appropriate given its analysis of inherent credit losses on december  table twelve allocation of the allowance for credit losses december dollars in millions amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial real estate commercial real estate construction total commercial      residential mortgage credit card other consumer total consumer foreign

internal loan workout units are devoted to the management and or collection of certain nonperforming assets as well as certain performing loans 
management believes concerted collection strategies and a proactive approach to managing overall credit risk have expedited the disposition  collection and renegotiation of nonperforming and other lower quality assets
