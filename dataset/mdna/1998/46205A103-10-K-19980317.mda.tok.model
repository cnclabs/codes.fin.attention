item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since its inception in  the company has grown primarily through the acquisition or management of radio and television broadcast stations and radio networks  as well as subsequent improvement in the operation of these properties 
two of the company s former business segments  paxson radio and paxson network affiliated television  have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented as a result of the company s sale of these operations during the company currently operates a nationwide network of owned  operated or affiliated television stations carrying its proprietary network  which broadcasts long form paid programming consisting primarily of infomercials 
certain of the company s television stations were and continue to be operated under time brokerage and affiliation agreements for various periods 
pursuant to the time brokerage agreements  the stations operating revenues and expenses are controlled by the company and are included in its consolidated statements of operations 
pursuant to the affiliation agreements the company includes advertising revenue  related sales costs and affiliation fees in its consolidated statements of operations 
the company announced in november its intention to launch pax net  a new broadcast television network of family values oriented programming on august  the company also owns a interest in the travel channel  llc  a cable television network joint venture with discovery communications  inc dci 
the company s interest in the operating results of the travel channel  llc has been included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting 
the company s operating data throughout the periods discussed have been impacted significantly by the timing and mix of television acquisitions throughout such periods 
operating revenues are derived from the sale of advertising to local and national advertisers 
the company s primary operating expenses include commissions on revenues  employee salaries and administrative expenses 
upon launch of pax net the company will also incur significant expense for syndicated program rights fees  ratings services and promotion 
presently the costs of operating the company s television stations do not vary significantly with revenue  with the exception of costs associated with sales commissions and agency fees 
as such  upon obtaining a certain level of revenue sufficient to cover fixed costs  additional revenue levels have a significant impact on the operating results of an individual television station 
the company currently expects to continue acquiring additional stations which may have similar effects on the comparability of revenues  operating expenses  interest expense and operating cash flow as those described above 
the company s business is subject to various risks and uncertainties which may significantly reduce revenues and increase operating expenses 
for example  a reduction in expenditures by television advertisers in the company s markets may result in lower revenues 
the company may be unable to reduce expenses  including syndicated program rights fees and certain variable expenses  in an amount sufficient in the short term to offset lost revenues caused by poor market conditions 
the broadcasting industry continues to undergo rapid technological change which may increase competition within the company s markets as new delivery systems  such as direct broadcast satellite and computer networks  attract customers 
the changing nature of audience tastes and viewing habits may affect the continued attractiveness of the company s broadcasting stations to advertisers  upon whom the company is dependent for its revenue 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount contingent or otherwise of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the fair values of the company s investments in broadcast properties are estimated based on recent market sale prices for comparable stations and markets and approximates their carrying value as of december  the fair values of the company s long term debt and the notes were estimated based on market rates of instruments with similar risks and maturities  and approximates the carrying value as of december  as a result of the foregoing  the estimates presented in the company s financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange and have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of the company s financial statements 
the company believes that its network of television stations comprise a valuable national television broadcasting distribution infrastructure  the value of which could potentially be greater if employed to air programming other than  or in addition to  the long form paid programming which is currently being aired 
including all pending station acquisitions  construction projects  divestitures and other transactions  the company will broadcast via a total of stations in markets reaching more than approximately million us tv households  including stations in each of the nation s top markets as well as of the nation s top markets 
the company announced in november its intention to launch pax net  a new broadcast television network of family values oriented programming  on august  this new network will allow the company to obtain programming and sell spot advertising during such programming on its own 
the company believes that this strategy will provide an opportunity to achieve greater long term shareholder value than that achievable through alternative uses of its broadcasting distribution infrastructure 
the company has entered into programming contracts to air syndicated television shows as well as theatrical and made for television movies from to as of march   such programming contracts require collective payments by the company of approximately million over such periods as follows thereafter  the company had million of broadcast rights deposits recorded in other assets as of december  the company continues to evaluate additional programming 
the company expects that under pax net  selling expenses will remain proportionate to revenues and that revenues as well as promotional and programming expenses will increase significantly 
see business forward looking statements and associated considerations for a discussion of certain factors which could influence the company s future performance and prospects 
discontinued operations during  the company sold two business segments  paxson radio and paxson network affiliated television 
losses from operations of these segments in  net of tax  were million compared to income of million in the losses in primarily reflect the sale of paxson network affiliated television on july  and paxson radio on october  compared to full year results of operations for paxson network affiliated television and paxson radio generally experienced their lowest revenue in the first quarter of the year  whereas the highest revenue for the year generally occurred in the fourth quarter 
paxson network affiliated television net losses were  in compared to net income of  in paxson radio net losses were million in compared to net income of million in income from operations of these segments in  net of tax  was million compared to a loss of  in the improved results in were primarily related to paxson radio  which had income of million in compared to a loss of million in the increase in income in for paxson radio primarily reflects revenue increases from radio stations and billboard faces due to acquisitions as well as revenue increases from existing stations 
in  paxson network affiliated television had income of  compared to income of million in the decline in income in for paxson network affiliated television primarily reflects increased time brokerage fees paid to operate wtvx tv  which the company began to operate pursuant to a time brokerage agreement in august in connection with the disposal of its network affiliated television and paxson radio segments in  the company recorded gains of million and million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes 
net proceeds from the sale of these segments were approximately million

operating expenses for increased or million to million from million for the increase was due to higher direct expenses such as commissions which rise in proportion to revenues million  compensation associated with paxson radio asset sales million  other non direct costs  which are primarily due to operating new television stations million  higher depreciation and amortization primarily related to assets acquired million  and increased time brokerage agreement fees  primarily related to new time brokerage operations million  of which increase  million is attributable to wpxn tv  all of which were partially offset by lower option plan compensation costs million 
operating cash flow for increased or million to million  from million for the increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of television station acquisitions and new time brokerage operations  with wpxn tv accounting for million of the increase 
for purposes of this report  operating cash flow is defined as net income excluding non cash items  non recurring items including compensation associated with paxson radio asset sales  discontinued operations and relocation costs  interest  other income  income taxes and time brokerage fees  less scheduled program rights payments 
the company has included operating cash flow data because the financial performance of broadcast companies is frequently evaluated based on some measure of cash flow from operations 
operating cash flow is not  and should not be used as  an indicator of or alternative to operating income  net income or cash flow as reflected in the consolidated financial statements as it is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company has issued options to purchase shares of class a common stock to certain members of management and employees during  and under its stock compensation plans 
there are currently  options outstanding under these plans

the gain realized upon the disposal of paxson radio was substantially deferred for tax purposes 
the remaining gain on the disposal of the paxson radio and network affiliated television segments was offset through the use of net operating losses available at december  as well as tax losses generated from operations during the deferral of approximately million of taxes on the approximately million gain upon the sale of paxson radio could be contested by the internal revenue service irs 
based on the advice of counsel  management believes that  in the event of a challenge by the irs of these tax positions  it is more likely than not that the company would prevail 
should the irs successfully challenge the company on these matters  the company could be subject to a material current tax liability

the company anticipates that the proceeds from the above segment sales will be utilized primarily to fund the pending television acquisitions  related capital expenditures and programming payments discussed elsewhere herein and for general corporate purposes 
the completion of each of the acquisitions discussed elsewhere herein is subject to a variety of factors and to the satisfaction of various conditions  and there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be completed 
the company s working capital at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and on such dates  respectively 
working capital increased primarily due to the funds received from the segment sales discussed above 
cash used in provided by operating activities was  and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used primarily reflects the decrease in accounts payable  the payment of compensation associated with paxson radio asset sales and the increase in restricted cash required pursuant to the amendments to the revolving credit facility 
cash used for investing activities of  and million for  and  respectively  primarily reflects acquisitions of and investments in broadcast properties and purchases of equipment for acquired and existing properties net of the proceeds from the above segment sales and asset sales 
cash provided by financing activities of  and million in  and  respectively  primarily reflects the proceeds from borrowings and proceeds of equity offerings  net of repayments and loan origination costs incurred 
non cash activity relates to option plan compensation  stock issued for the travel channel  wpxw tv and wfsj fm acquisitions  a note payable incurred with the wypx tv acquisition  reciprocal trade and barter advertising revenue and expense and accretion of discount on the notes  as well as dividends on the company s redeemable preferred stock and common stock warrants 
the company s primary capital requirements are for the acquisition of broadcasting properties and related capital expenditures  syndicated programming payments and interest payments on indebtedness 
the notes require semi annual interest payments at a fixed rate 
at december   the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under its revolving credit facility 
in march  the company obtained a waiver of such noncompliance from its lenders and executed an amendment to the terms of the revolving credit facility 
the amended terms adjust the covenants of the credit facility for the sale of the company s network affiliated television and paxson radio segments in and address the company s business plan related to the pax net launch 
in addition  certain financial covenants were temporarily modified to allow for anticipated compliance by the company throughout the remainder of the waiver and amendment agreement also requires the company to use its best efforts to raise an additional million of equity by may  and apply the net proceeds therefrom to repay the revolving credit facility and requires the company to fund million of interest into a cash collateral account for the benefit of the lenders 
on march   the company obtained a fully underwritten commitment the commitment letter for a million senior term credit facility maturing june the senior credit facility to be used to refinance the amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the commitment letter  the outstanding debt will be secured by substantially all of the company s assets and bear interest at a base rate plus or libor plus  at the company s option 
the senior credit facility will require the company to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios subsequent to march and will contain other restrictions 
management expects to execute a senior credit facility pursuant to the terms of the commitment letter before may  the company will require additional financing to enable it to complete acquisitions which are currently pending  continue its acquisition strategy and to fund capital expenditures on existing and acquired properties  syndicated program rights fees and the company s working capital requirements 
the timing and amount of the company s additional financing needs will depend  among other things  upon the timing of closings of pending acquisitions which are dependent upon the satisfaction of closing conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company presently has no additional borrowing capacity pursuant to the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility 
as the company s cash available for acquisitions at december  will not be adequate to pay the purchase price of all pending acquisitions  the company is considering additional sources of financing  including public and private sales of equity and debt securities 
the failure to raise funds necessary to finance the company s future cash requirements could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its business strategy 
in addition  should the company suffer a significant impairment to its cash flow from operations due to the occurrence of one or more adverse events  the company could have insufficient resources to repay indebtedness under the revolving credit facility or the notes when due or to make required payments on the preferred stock 
year considerations in the next two years  many companies will face potentially serious issues associated with the inability of existing data processing hardware and software to appropriately recognize calendar dates beginning in the year many computer programs that can only distinguish the final two digits of the year entered may read entries for the year as the year and compute payment  interest or delinquency based on the wrong date  or are expected to be unable to compute payment  interest or delinquency 
the company is in the process of identifying the software applications and hardware devices expected to be impacted by this issue 
the company is currently developing a new billing and inventory system to be put in use by the end of to meet the needs of pax net 
this new billing and inventory system will address the year compliance issues 
the company s general ledger system is not year compliant 
as a result  and in order to accommodate the company s future growth  the company s management is in the process of evaluating third party systems which are year compliant 
while the company expects that efforts on the part of current employees of the company will be required to continue to monitor year activities  the company does not expect the cost of addressing any year issue will be a material event or uncertainty that would have a material adverse effect on future operating results or financial condition
