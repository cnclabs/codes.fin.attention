as a potential source of additional longer term capital  the company is exploring the possible repositioning of its community center portfolio in a way that will facilitate a sale of these assets over a period of time  as capital is needed 
such repositioning may include the contribution of these assets into another real estate company for stock or other forms of ownership with the intent of liquidating the stock over a period of two to four years

net cash used in financing activities decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in net borrowings 
funds from operations the company generally considers funds from operations ffo a widely used and appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit that provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo as defined by nareit means income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
the company s method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  ii is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including its ability to make distributions and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance 
ffo for the year ended december   increased to million compared to million for the comparable period in ffo amounts were calculated in accordance with nareit s definition of ffo as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands funds from operations calculation income before extraordinary item and minority interest   adjustments add depreciation and amortization of real estate assets   add adjustment for real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated affiliates  add loss on sale of furniture  fixtures and equipment add extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations   seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales peaking in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season 
as a result  a substantial portion of the percentage rents is not paid until the fourth quarter 
furthermore  most new lease up occurs towards the later part of the year in anticipation of the holiday season and most vacancies occur toward the beginning of the year 
in addition  the majority of the temporary tenants take occupancy in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  cash flow and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality also impacts the quarter by quarter results of net operating income and ffo  although accruing minimum and percentage rents on a straight line basis during the year in accordance with gaap largely mitigates this impact 
economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  it has had little impact on the operation of the mills entities and the company during that period 
even in periods of higher inflation  however  tenant leases provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company 
as operating costs increase  leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants 
furthermore  most of the leases contain base rent steps and percentage rent clauses that provide additional rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
these provisions provide some protection to the company during highly inflationary periods 
implications of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal computer software that has time sensitive programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities the company has recognized the need to ensure that its systems  equipment and operations will not be adversely impacted by the change to calendar year as such  the company has taken steps to identify potential areas of risk and has begun addressing these in its planning  purchasing and daily operations 
the total cost of converting all internal systems  equipment and operations for the year has not been fully quantified  but it is not expected to be a material cost to the company 
however  no such estimates can be made as to the potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year summary of outstanding indebtedness as of december   the company had outstanding indebtedness in an aggregate amount of approximately million excluding its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt as set forth below earliest date principal interest maturity annual debt at which debt mortgage loan balance rate type annual interest rate date service can be repaid dollars in thousands potomac mills gurnee mills tranche a  fixed  tranche b  fixed  tranche c  fixed  tranche d  fixed  franklin mills liberty plaza tranche a  fixed  mortgage loan  fixed  sawgrass mills tranche a  fixed   variable with tranche b cap bp over libor   variable with tranche c cap bp over libor   sawgrass mills phase ii  variable bp over libor  western hills  fixed  community centers  fixed  operating p ship  fixed operating p ship  fixed line of credit  variable bp over libor   sawgrass residual  variable bp over libor total   this indebtedness is a year amortizing loan with an anticipated balloon payment on december  in the event the mortgage loan is not repaid by the anticipated balloon repayment date  the annual interest rate for each tranche will be increased by per annum in excess of the stated interest rate
