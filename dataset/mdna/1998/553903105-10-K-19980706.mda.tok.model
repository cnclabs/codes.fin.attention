management believes that the company s working capital  bank lines of credit and cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months  however  in the longer term  the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements including financing of accounts receivable and inventory  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such funds through public or private equity financing  bank lines of credit or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company 
inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations in the past 
there can be no assurance  however  that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods 
upgrade of existing computer infrastructure  year issue the company is in the process of upgrading its existing computer infrastructure and replacing all of its manufacturing  accounting  customer service and other management information software with an enterprise wide business system which is year compliant 
although the company expects that the new computer hardware and enterprise wide business system will be installed by the end of fiscal year  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve this installation on time 
further  the company has never undertaken such a significant modification to its information management systems and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience significant delays and or compatibility issues in the installation and testing of the enterprise wide business system 
the new enterprise wide business system will also require extensive training across all departments 
any delays or significant issues with respect to installation or training could materially adversely effect the company s results of operation 
in addition  the company has implemented a review program to address year issues as they relate to the company s software products sold to third parties and the company s key suppliers 
the company expects year compliance during fiscal year and does not expect the cost to achieve compliance to be material to the company 
any delay by the company or third parties in achieving year compliance could materially adversely effect the company s results of operations 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
and  reporting comprehensive income statement and disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information statement  respectively collectively  the statements 
the statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement establishes standards for reporting of comprehensive income and its components in annual financial statements 
statement establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise s operating segments in its annual financial statements and selected segment information in interim financial reports

in october  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa released statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
among other things  sop eliminates the distinction between significant and insignificant vendor obligations promulgated by sop and requires each element of a software arrangement to meet certain criteria in order to recognize revenue allocated to that element 
additionally  sop requires that total fees under an arrangement be allocated to each element in the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence  as defined 
sop is effective for software transactions entered into by the company in fiscal and subsequent periods 
as a result of certain issues raised in applying sop  in march  the aicpa issued a statement of position which delays for one year the effective date of certain provisions of sop with respect to what constitutes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the delivered software element in certain multiple element arrangements that include service elements entered into by entities that never sell the software elements separately 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sop and the new sop will have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
however  the ultimate resolution of the implementation issues referred to above  or additional issues not yet raised or addressed by the aicpa  could change the company s expectation 
risk factors the non historical information in this form k includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the actual results for the company may differ materially from those described in any forward looking statement 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and throughout this form k 
dependence on new products the computer industry is characterized by rapid technological change and is highly competitive with respect to product innovation and introduction 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new  innovative product with features that respond to customers changing demands will be critical to its future success 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to design and manufacture products that will achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure to design  manufacture  and successfully introduce products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the success of new products is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of product design  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields and market acceptance 
additional risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions  accurate forecasting of customer demand  and the desire by customers to evaluate new  more expensive products for longer periods of time 
continued product development efforts are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new products  including unanticipated development problems and delays as well as the costs to undertake the development that could result in abandonment or substantial change in the development of a specific product 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies 
management of growth the company has experienced rapid growth  particularly during the last two years 
the company anticipates that continued growth  if any  will require management of that growth  including but not limited to  recruiting  hiring  training and retaining significant numbers of qualified personnel  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses and managing assets 
in particular  continued growth will require that the company train  integrate and retain qualified sales personnel in various geographic regions 
as the company is in a highly competitive growth market  the loss of a significant number of such persons  as well as the failure to recruit additional personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
should the company continue to experience rapid growth  there can be no assurance that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that management will adequately anticipate all demands that growth will place on the company 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s products and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition the market for the company s products is extremely competitive 
the company competes with many companies  certain of which have substantially greater financial and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and greater overall customer loyalty than the company 
in addition  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there also has been  and may continue to be  a willingness on the part of certain large competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which cannot be foreseen by the company 
the company believes that pricing pressures are likely to continue as competitors develop more competitive product offerings 
the principal elements of competition in the company s markets include rapid introduction of new technology  product quality and reliability  price and performance characteristics  service and support  and responsiveness to customers 
the company believes that  in general  it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
international sales international sales continue to represent a significant portion of the company s total revenue 
these sales activities are subject to the normal risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
other risks inherent in the company s international business include longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
most of the sales made by the company in international markets are priced in the applicable local currency and are subject to currency exchange fluctuations 
the company may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure 
there can be no assurance that the use of such contracts will be sufficient to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
international sales are subject to the risk of compliance with laws of various countries and the risk of import export restrictions and tariff regulations 
the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the united states department of commerce for international sales 
dependence on suppliers the principal components used in the company s products include circuit boards  drives and chassis 
the company procures all of its parts from outside suppliers and has established manufacturing relationships with a number of key suppliers  primarily of disk drives  tape and tape library systems 
the company generally utilizes parts and components available from multiple vendors 
however  components critical to the current design of the company s and series of products  namely a raid controller board manufactured by mylex corporation  is available to the company only from this source 
to date  the company has been able to obtain supplies of these parts and believes that adequate quantities are available to meet its needs 
disruptions in supply or material increases in the cost of these components would have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
uneven pattern of quarterly results the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations may continue in the future 
these fluctuations have been and may continue to be caused by a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  the timing of customer orders a large majority of which have historically been placed in the last month of each quarter  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of the company s products  shifts in product mix and the timing of sales and marketing and research and development expenditures 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  including the company s ability to continue to develop innovative products  the introduction of new products by the company s competitors and decreases in gross profit margin for mature products 
in addition  the company has operated historically without a significant backlog of orders and  as a result  net product revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and products shipped during that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
if revenue does not meet the company s expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact on the company s liquidity position and net income may be magnified by the company s inability to reduce expenditures quickly enough to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
further  as is common in the computer industry  the company historically has experienced an increase in the number of orders and shipments in the latter part of each quarter and the company expects this pattern to continue in the future 
the company s failure to receive anticipated orders or to complete shipments in the latter part of a quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that future revenues and operating results will not be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s common stock 
volatility of stock price the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility in response to the timing and announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  variations in quarterly results of operations  failure of such results of operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and speculation in the press or investment community 
in addition  the stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to the operating performance of the company 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations affect the market price of the company s common stock 
because of these reasons  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
intellectual property rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and technical measures to protect its intellectual property rights 
although the company continues to take appropriate measures to protect its intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be sold may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation 
although the company believes that its products and trade designations do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
if such a claim is made  the company will evaluate the claim as it relates to its products and  if appropriate  may seek a license to use the protected technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a license to use such technology or that such a license could be obtained on terms that would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to license protected technology  the company could be prohibited from incorporating or marketing products incorporating that technology 
the company could also incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend any legal action taken against it 
should the company s products be found to infringe protected technology  the company could be required to pay damages to the infringed party or be enjoined from manufacturing and selling such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation 
control by principal shareholder raymond j 
noorda  the chairman of the board of the company  beneficially owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result of his ownership  mr 
noorda is able to control actions of the company which require stockholder approval 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of changing or preventing a change in control of the company  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions
