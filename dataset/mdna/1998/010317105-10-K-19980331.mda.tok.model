item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition of the company and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods indicated 
on november   first american bancorp fab  a one bank holding company headquartered in decatur  alabama  was merged with and into the company  pursuant to which each share of fab common stock was converted into 
shares of the company s common stock for a total of  shares 
the fab merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on september   firstbanc holding company firstbanc  a one bank holding company headquartered in robertsdale  alabama  was merged into the company 
the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of firstbanc in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the firstbanc merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on december   national commerce corporation ncc and its wholly owned subsidiary  commerce bankshares  inc cbs a one bank holding company located in birmingham  alabama  was merged with and into the company the ncc merger 
pursuant to terms of the ncc merger  each share of ncc common stock was converted into shares of anb common stock and each share of cbs common stock was converted into shares of anb common stock for a total of  shares or of anb s common stock 
the ncc merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  whereby ncc is deemed to have acquired anb for financial reporting purposes 
however  anb remained as the continuing legal entity and registrant for securities and exchange commission purposes 
consistent with the reverse acquisition accounting treatment  the historical financial statements of the company presented for are the consolidated financial statements of ncc  adjusted for subsequent poolings of interest  and differ from the consolidated financial statements of anb as previously reported 
the operations of anb are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the historical consolidated financial statements of the company and the five year summary of selected financial data derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of the company are set forth elsewhere herein 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data and the other financial information included in this annual report

concurrent with this transfer  first bank converted to a national bank  changed its name to citizens peoples bank  national association  and relocated its headquarters from robertsdale  alabama to cantonment  florida 
this is the first bank to be operated by the company outside of alabama 
in december  first citizens bank  national association first citizens  formerly first national bank of ashland  a subsidiary of the company  was merged with citizens bank of talladega  also a subsidiary of the company

results of operations year ended december   compared with year ended december  the company s net income decreased by  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in  as interest income increased by million and interest expense increased million 
the increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to a million increase in average loans to million during  from million during  as a result of management emphasis on loan growth 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in average time deposits of million to million in  from million in in general  loans are the company s highest yielding earning asset and time deposits are one of the company s highest cost interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  decreasing by and basis points  respectively  from these decreases reflect declining yield on average loans and an increasing cost of interest bearing liabilities  both attributable to competition from banks and other financial institutions 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million during  million of which was recorded at fab 
the fab provision was primarily associated with higher loss experience in fab s indirect automobile lending and sub prime mortgage lending portfolios which lending businesses have been discontinued 
the provision of million compares with a provision for loan losses of  during  an increase of million  or 
following the provision  management believes that both loan loss experience and asset quality indicate that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an adequate level 
the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period end loans was at december   compared to at december   and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period end nonperforming assets was at december   compared with at december  the company experienced net charge offs of million in equating to a ratio of net charge offs to average loans of

noninterest income increased  or  to million in  compared with million in the company experienced increases in its fee based divisions investment services  trust  and mortgage lending of million  or  to million in from million in these increases were offset by a charge to provide for the consolidation of fab s data processing facilities into the existing company facility and by losses resulting from abandonment of certain leasehold improvements  all which total  in compared to a net gain of  in  a decrease of  noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during  compared with million during income before the provision for income taxes decreased  or  to million in  from million in income before minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiary and net income decreased  and  respectively  during year ended december   compared with year ended december  the company s net income increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in  as interest income increased by million and interest expense increased million 
the increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to a million increase in average loans to million during  from million during  as a result of the ncc merger and an increased management emphasis on loan growth 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in average time deposits of million to million in  from million in the company s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  increasing by and basis points  respectively  from these increases reflect the increase in average loans  relative to other earning assets 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  during  compared with a provision for loan losses of million during  a decline of  or

see provision and allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income increased million  or  to million in  compared with million in the increase is partly attributable to an increase in investment services income of million  or  to million in  compared with million in  with the remainder of the increase being attributed to the ncc merger 
the increase in investment services income resulted from expansion of the sales forces in mid noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during  compared with million during of the million increase in noninterest expense  approximately million is attributable to expansion of the investment services division of the company  with the remaining increase being attributed to ncc merger 
income before the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  from million in income before minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiary and net income increased million and million  respectively  during net interest income the largest component of the company s net income is its net interest income the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support its assets 
net interest income is determined by the yield earned on the company s earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average earning assets represents the company s net interest margin 
average balances  income  expenses and rates the following table depicts  on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods indicated  certain information related to the company s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields or costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities

during  with little change in the overall interest rate levels from that in  the company experienced an increase in net interest income of million  or  to million  compared with million in net interest income increased despite a decrease in the net interest spread of basis points to in from in  and a decrease in the net interest margin of basis points to in  compared with in because the relative yield on loans exceeds that of all other earnings assets  the primary reason for the increased net interest income was a increase in average loan volume 
the primary reason for the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin was spread compression resulting from  generally  lower rates on loans  and higher rates on marginal funding sources  such as time deposits  federal funds purchased  and federal home loan bank borrowings  as well as an increase in higher cost time deposits as a percentage of total deposits  which are among the highest cost funding sources available to the company 
during  net average earning assets increased by million  or  to  million from million in  while average loans increased million  or  to million in from million in analysis of changes in net interest income the following table sets forth  on a taxable equivalent basis  the effect which varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates had on changes in net interest income for and for the purposes of this table  changes which are not solely attributable to volume or rate are allocated to volume and rate on a pro rata basis

the principal monitoring technique employed by the company is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
the company evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing  and sources and prices of off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk 
the company uses computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios 
the modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time 
the following table illustrates the company s interest rate sensitivity at december   assuming the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid  respectively  based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities

      period gap      cumulative gap       ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans of  excludes investment equity securities of  excludes matured certificates which have not been redeemed by the customer and on which no interest is accruing 
includes treasury  tax and loan account of  the company generally benefits from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap and generally benefits from decreasing market interest rates when it is liability sensitive 
the company is liability sensitive throughout one year 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  management believes that a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of the company s true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
market risk the company s earnings are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest paid on all interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in its lending  investing and deposit gathering activities 
the company seeks to reduce its exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing its interest rate risk 
management relies upon static gap analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which quantifies  to a large extent  the degree of market risk inherent in the company s balance sheet 
gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates 
simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from basis points below to basis points above the current prevailing rates 
management makes certain assumptions as to the effect varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources 
with respect to the primary earning assets  loans and securities  certain features of individual types of loans and specific securities introduce uncertainty as to their expected performance at varying levels of interest rates 
in some cases  imbedded options exist whereby the borrower may elect to repay the obligation at any time 
these imbedded prepayment options make anticipating the performance of those instruments difficult given changes in prevailing rates 
at december   mortgage backed securities totaling million  or of total assets and essentially every loan  net of unearned income  totaling million  or of total assets  carry such imbedded options 
management believes that assumptions used in its simulation analysis about the performance of financial instruments with such imbedded options are appropriate 
however  the actual performance of these financial instruments may differ from management s estimates due to several factors  including the diversity and sophistication of the customer base  the general level of prevailing interest rates and the relationship to their historical levels  and general economic conditions 
the difference between those assumptions and actual results  if significant  could cause the actual results to differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
deposits totaled million  or  of total assets at december  since deposits are the primary funding source for earning assets  the associated market risk is considered by management in its simulation analysis 
generally  it is anticipated that deposits will be sufficient to support funding requirements 
however  the rates paid for deposits at varying levels of prevailing interest rates have a significant impact on net interest income and therefore  must be quantified by the company in its simulation analysis 
specifically  the company s spread  the difference between the rates earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  is generally higher when prevailing rates are higher 
as prevailing rates reduce  the spread tends to compress  with severe compression at very low prevailing interest rates 
this characteristic is called spread compression and adversely effects net interest income in the simulation analysis when anticipated prevailing rates are reduced from current rates 
management relies upon historical experience to estimate the degree of spread compression in its simulation analysis 
management believes that such estimates of possible spread compression are reasonable 
however  if the degree of spread compression varies from that expected  the actual results could differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
the following table illustrates the results of simulation analysis used by the company to determine the extent to which market risk would have effected the net interest margin if prevailing interest rates differed from actual rates during because of the inherent use of estimates and assumptions in the simulation model used to derive this information  the actual results for and  certainly  the future impact of market risk on the company s net interest margin  may differ from that found in the table

on a monthly basis  management  through an independent loan review function  reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based on the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets and a review of historical statistical data for both the company and other financial institutions 
loan review evaluates the loan portfolio in accordance with regulatory guidelines and monitors those loans classified as doubtful  substandard and special mention 
internal classification combined with migration analysis of those classifications  currently covering months  are tools utilized by loan review to make specific evaluations as to the level of allowance for loan losses necessary to reserve for expected loan losses in the portfolio 
also considered in management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are the level of nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations conducted for each bank  including their evaluation of the company s policies and procedures and classification of loans 
due to an increase in the loss experience in fab s indirect automobile lending and sub prime lending portfolios  management deemed it prudent to increase fab s provision for loan losses during this indirect automobile lending and sub prime mortgage lending businesses have been discontinued and management believes the allowance for loan losses adequately covers the company s exposure to loan losses 
management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is also based upon assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable 
these assumptions include consistent application of sound underwriting standards  continued low turnover among lending staff  general economic conditions including stable interest rates  and stable levels of nonperforming loans 
should these assumptions change  there is no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional loan loss provisions will not be required 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on the company s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level as determined by management 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance for loan losses

a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest which is accrued on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual writedown or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses 
during the years ending december   and  approximately   and  respectively  in additional interest income would have been recognized in earnings if the company s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms 
total nonperforming assets increased million to million at december l   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december   compared with at december  this ratio will generally fluctuate from period to period depending upon nonperforming asset levels at period end 
the nonperforming assets increased at year end compared with primarily due to the discontinued indirect automobile and sub grade mortgage loan portfolios at fab 
potential problem loans a potential problem loan is one that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s future performance under terms of the loan contract 
these loans are current as to principal and interest  and accordingly  they are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
management monitors these loans closely in order to ensure that the company s interests are protected 
at december   the company had certain loans considered by management to be potential problem loans totaling million 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income the company relies on four distinct product lines for the production of recurring noninterest income traditional retail and commercial banking  mortgage banking  trust services and investment services 
combined fees associated with these product lines totaled million in  compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
non recurring losses in totaled  resulting from a charge to provide for the consolidation of fab s data processing facility into the existing company facility and by losses resulting from the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements

other investment services revenue consists of interest and dividends on trading assets and fee based services including asset and liability reporting  bond accounting and security safekeeping 
these results include certain income and expense items that are allocated by management to the investment services areas of the company 
the increase in investment services revenues of million  or  to million in from million in was attributable to staff additions  new customer relationships and favorable market conditions 
the million  or  increase in expenses and allocated charges to million in from million in is consistent with additional revenue generation 
these results are not necessarily the same as would be expected if these activities were conducted by a stand alone entity because certain corporate overhead expenses are not allocated directly to this division

similar conditions resulted in a increase in trust department fees to million in from million in despite the increase in trust division income  trust division expenses and allocated charges decreased in versus  from million to million 
this  decrease resulted from operating changes initiated during the  increase  or  in expenses and allocated charges to million in from  in resulted from a combination of growth and reorganization of the operations section of the trust division 
these results are not necessarily the same as would be expected if these activities were conducted by a stand alone entity because certain corporate overhead expenses are not allocated directly to this division

expenses and allocated charges in the mortgage lending division grew to million in from million in  an increase if  in spite of this increase  these expenses grew at a lower rate than revenues as a result of more efficient operations and leveraging the available fixed cost structure 
these results are not necessarily the same as would be expected if these activities were conducted by a stand alone entity because certain corporate overhead expenses are not allocated directly to this division 
earning assets loans loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans  net of unearned income  were million compared to million at the end of  an increase of million  or the growth in the company s loan portfolio is attributable to general economic conditions that resulted in increased loan demand from existing customers and the company s ability to attract new customers while maintaining consistent underwriting standards

it is common practice for financial institutions in the company s market areas to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
the principal component of the company s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at year end  this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  of the total loan portfolio  at year end commercial mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december  residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december   due primarily to an increased emphasis in residential lending  especially home equity lines of credit 
the growth of commercial and financial loans was flat in  reflecting increased competition from banks and other financial institutions in this segment of the market 
consumer loans decreased million  or  during to million from million in as a result of reduced emphasis on certain areas of consumer lending such as indirect automobile loans 
other categories of loans comprised less than of total loans at december  and the company s loan portfolio represents diversification within its alabama markets  and is represented in the higher growth shelby  baldwin  morgan  madison  and st

at december   mortgage backed securities consisting of collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through mortgage obligations totaled million  classified as investment securities of million and securities available for sale of million 
management expects the annual repayment of the underlying mortgages to vary as a result of monthly repayment of principal and or interest required under terms of the underlying promissory notes 
further  the actual rate of repayment is subject to changes depending upon both terms of the underlying mortgages and the relative level of mortgage interest rates 
when relative interest rates decline to levels below that of the underlying mortgages  acceleration of principal repayment is expected as some borrowers on the underlying mortgages refinance to lower rates 
when the underlying rates on mortgage loans are comparable to  or in excess of  market rates  repayment more closely conforms to scheduled amortization in accordance with terms of the promissory note 
accordingly  management expects repayment of the collateralized mortgage obligations in three to five years  and repayment of the pass through mortgage obligations in five to seven years 
other attributes of securities are discussed in interest sensitivity and market risk 
short term investments the company utilizes overnight investment of funds in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell to ensure that adequate liquidity will be maintained  while at the same time minimizing the level of uninvested cash reserves 
short term investments are also utilized by the company when the level of funds committed to lending and investment portfolio programs changes or the level of deposit generation changes 
during  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell averaged million  compared to million during  representing a million  or  increase as the company experienced growth in both loans and investment securities 
trading account securities an important aspect of investment department operations  but less so to the company in total  are trading account securities  which represent securities owned by the company prior to delivery to the company s customers 
trading account securities averaged million in and million in  this small dollar amount reflects management s policy of limiting positions in such securities to reduce its exposure to market and interest rate changes 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to million in  from million in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million in  from million in average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million  or  to million in  from million in average short term borrowings increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million is deposits average total deposits increased million  or  to million during  from million during at december   total deposits were million  compared with million at december   an increase of million  or 
the following table sets forth the deposits of the company by category at the dates indicated 
deposits amounts in thousands  except percentages december  percent percent percent amount of total amount of total amount of total demand    now    savings and money market    time less than     time greater than     total deposits    percent percent amount of total amount of total demand   now   savings and money market   time less than    time greater than    total deposits   core deposits  which exclude time deposits of  or more  provide for a relatively stable funding source that supports earning assets 
the company s core deposits totaled million  or  of total deposits at december  and totaled million  or  of total deposits at december  deposits  in particular core deposits  have historically been the company s primary source of funding and have enabled the company to meet successfully both short term and long term liquidity needs 
management anticipates that such deposits will continue to be the company s primary source of funding in the future 
the company s loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of  and the end of  and the ratio averaged during the maturity distribution of the company s time deposits in excess of  at december   is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more amounts in thousands december  after one after three after six through through through after within one three six twelve twelve month months months months months total certificates of deposit of  or more       other time deposits of  or more    total       approximately of the company s time deposits over  had scheduled maturities within three months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets with large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
the company has not historically used broker deposits 
borrowed funds borrowed funds include four broad categories  i federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  ii treasury  tax and loan balances  iii federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  and iv borrowings from an independent bank 
because of a relatively high loan to deposit ratio  the existence and stability of these funding sources are critical to the company s maintenance of short term and long term liquidity 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent both an input of excess funds from correspondent bank customers of the company as well as a cash management tool offered to corporate customers 
at december   these funds totaled million  compared with million at december  at december  treasury  tax and loan balances totaled million  compared to million at december  the company collects tax deposits from customers and is permitted to retain these balances until established collateral limits are exceeded or until the us treasury withdraws its balances 
the company s average borrowing from an independent bank under a million credit facility the credit facility was million during  compared with million during as of december   the remaining availability under the credit facility was million 
the credit facility bears interest at a rate that varies with libor and is secured by stock in the banks 
effective january   the credit facility was renegotiated and renewed providing for a current due date of may  three of the banks are members of the fhlb 
at december   these banks had available fhlb lines of million  under which million was outstanding  including advances classified as short term of million and advances classified as long term of million 
this compares to borrowings of million at december   of which million was short term and million was long term

under the capital guidelines of their regulators  the company and the banks are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of  with at least being tier i capital 
tier i capital consists of common stockholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  under the guidelines  the company and the banks must maintain a minimum tier i leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is typically increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions 
the company exceeded its fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december   and  as set forth in the following table

liquidity represents the ability of an entity to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  the company will not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
increased liquidity in typical interest rate environments often involves decreasing profits by investing in earning assets with shorter maturities 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
assets included in the company s consolidated statements of condition contribute to liquidity management 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell position  including interest bearing deposits in other banks  its primary source of liquidity  averaged million during and was million at december   and averaged million during and was million at december  if required in short term liquidity management  these assets could be converted to cash immediately 
cash received from the repayment of investment securities and loans provide a constant source of cash that contributes to liquidity management 
unpledged securities  with a carrying value of approximately million at december  provide the company an opportunity to generate cash by  providing additional collateral by selling securities under agreements to repurchase  providing collateral to obtain public funds or providing collateral to borrow directly from the federal reserve bank or the federal home loan bank 
see loans and securities 
liquidity can also be managed using liabilities included in the company s consolidated statement of condition  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short term borrowing 
combined federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury  tax and loan  and short term borrowings averaged million during and was million at december   and averaged million during and was million at december  overnight borrowing lines with upstream correspondent banks  million at december   of which million was unused  provide additional sources of liquidity to the company on an unsecured basis 
the federal home loan bank provides secured and unsecured credit lines to three of the company s banks totaling approximately million 
at december   advances under these lines totaled million  including million classified as short term and million classified as long term 
long term liquidity needs are met through the company s deposit base approximately of the company s deposits at december   are considered core deposits  and the repayment of loans and other investments as they mature 
the company is able to manage its long term liquidity needs by adjusting the rates it pays on longer term deposits and the amount and mix of longer term investments in its portfolio 
the company  as a stand alone corporation  has more limited access to liquidity sources than its banks and depends on dividends from its subsidiaries as its primary source of liquidity 
the company s liquidity is diminished by required payments on its outstanding short term debt 
the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions which may  but are not expected to  have a material negative impact on the liquidity available to the company 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
if circumstances warrant  the company s short term liquidity needs can also be met by additional borrowings of approximately million representing the unused portion of the company s credit facility with an unrelated bank

impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and its subsidiaries are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation

management believes that the company s most critical software system is the company s core operating software  which is provided by jack henry associates  inc jha 
jha has provided documentation to management that its software is year compliant  although it will continue to test its systems to verify compliance 
most other software vendors of the company have indicated to management that programming and testing will continue through the end of the company has also developed a year compliance policy to provide a process for its subsidiary banks to address year issues with larger commercial customers whose business might be impacted by the century change
