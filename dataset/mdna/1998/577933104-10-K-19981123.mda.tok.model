founded in  the company has been profitable every year since inception 
the company conducts its operations through two groups  the government operations group and the consulting group

the consulting group provides consulting services to every state  county and local government agency  including health and human services  law enforcement  parks and recreation  taxation  housing  motor vehicles  labor  education and legislatures 
the company s revenues are generated from contracts with various payment arrangements  including i costs incurred plus a fixed fee cost plus  ii fixed price  iii performance based criteria  and iv time and materials reimbursement utilized primarily by the consulting group 
for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from these contract types were approximately   and  respectively  of total revenues 
traditionally  federal government contracts have been cost plus and a majority of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts because the company is subject to the risk of potential cost overruns or inaccurate revenue estimates 
effective january   the social security act of was amended to eliminate social security income and supplemental security disability insurance benefits based solely on drug and alcohol disabilities

indicative of the long term nature of the company s engagements  approximately of the company s fiscal revenues were in backlog as of september  the company s most significant expense is cost of revenues  which consists primarily of project related employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
the company s ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the service costs related to the company s fixed price and performance based contracts 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the client 
the profitability of the consulting group s contracts is largely dependent upon the utilization rates of its consultants and the success of its performance based contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of management  marketing and administration costs including salaries  benefits  travel  recruiting  continuing education and training  facilities costs  printing  reproduction  communications and equipment depreciation 
during  the company recognized two significant charges against income

because a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  the company has on occasion experienced a pattern in its results of operations pursuant to which it incurs greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts 
in addition  the termination of the ssa contract and the absence of revenues thereunder after march  significantly reduced the company s revenue base as compared to previous quarters 
no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations 
the company s cash flow from operations was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased accounts receivable related to revenue growth 
certain marketable securities were sold during the year ended september  generating million in proceeds 
these investments were sold to provide general working capital  including necessary income tax payments  and to pay the final s corporation distribution discussed below 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures and  as a services company  does not anticipate making any significant capital expenditures during fiscal year during the three months ended december   the company made final s corporation distributions totaling million

the company has not used the credit facility to finance its working capital needs and  at september   the company had million available under the credit facility 
management believes that the company will have sufficient resources to meet its cash needs over the next months 
such cash needs may include start up costs associated with new contract awards  obtaining additional office space  establishing new offices  investment in upgraded systems infrastructure and acquisitions of other businesses and technologies 
cash requirements beyond the next months depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements  its rate of growth  the amounts ultimately spent on business acquisitions  if any  and the leasing of new office space  if any 
year the company is aware of the issues that many computer systems will face as the millennium year approaches

the company estimates that its remediation efforts will be completed by march  the company does not believe that the cost of its remediation efforts will be material or that these efforts will have a material impact on its operations or financial results

the company also provides assistance in assessing  evaluating  testing and certifying government client systems affected by year problems  as well as quality assurance monitoring of year compliance conversions performed for clients by third parties 
although the company has attempted to contract to provide such services in a manner that will minimize its liability for system failures  there can be no assurance that the company would not become subject to legal proceedings which  if resolved in a manner adverse to the company  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
the company relies to varying extents on information processing performed by the governmental agencies and entities with which it contracts 
the company has inquired where necessary of such agencies and entities of potential year problems  and  based on responses to such inquiries  management believes that the company would be able to continue to perform on such contracts without material negative financial impact 
however  the company cannot be certain that year related systems failures in the information systems of clients will not occur and  if such failures occur  that they will not interfere with the company s ability to properly manage a contracted project and result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
