outlook price levels in the fourth quarter of were fairly consistent with historical  normal levels  as opposed to the near record high price levels experienced in the fourth quarter of propane prices rose dramatically in the fourth quarter of due to an early cold start to the winter and a mexican plant explosion  which had a detrimental impact on imported propane volumes into the united states 
the company was able to extend the benefit from these high price levels by entering into various hedge contracts which positively affected the company s results in the first quarter of it is expected that the results from the first quarter of will reflect price levels below historical levels  and the outlook for the balance of the year cannot be predicted 
the sales price of natural gas liquids is correlated with the price of crude oil  and crude oil prices have fallen significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of a significant portion of the company s revenues  and as a result  its gross margins  remain dependent upon the sales price of propane  which fluctuates with the winter weather conditions and other supply and demand determinants 
currently  markwest has an annual sensitivity to ngl prices equal to million in pretax income for every gallon change in ngl prices and an annual sensitivity to natural gas prices equal to million in pretax income for every mmbtu change in natural gas prices 
the company s future results are expected to be positively affected by volumes through its sour gas pipeline and plant in western michigan  which more than tripled to mmcf d in the fourth quarter of from mmcf d in the fourth quarter of drilling activities in the area are increasing considerably because of recent discoveries and the pending approval of further pipeline extensions 
by mid  markwest plans to extend the pipeline to connect to new and existing shut in wells  which will add mmcf d in the second half of these increased volumes  along with the new ngl extraction plant  which began operations in december  are expected to add substantial production volumes and related revenues to the company s operations in the second half of and beyond 
the company expects greater volumes to have a substantial and positive impact on earnings and cash flow in risk management activities the company s primary risk management objectives are to meet or exceed budgeted gross margins by locking in budgeted or above budgeted prices in the financial derivatives and physical markets and to protect margins from precipitous declines 
the company maintains a three person committee of senior management that oversees all hedging activity 
under internal guidelines  speculative transactions are prohibited 
markwest achieves its goals utilizing a combination of fixed price forward contracts  new york mercantile exchange traded futures  and fixed floating price swaps on the over the counter otc market 
first  the company protects margins through purchases of natural gas forward contracts with predetermined btu differentials based upon a basket of gulf coast ngl prices or a substitute for propane such as crude oil 
second  markwest also protects margins by purchasing natural gas futures while simultaneously selling propane futures of approximately the same btu value 
third  the company manages its commodity price risk on terminal propane purchases and sales by purchasing and selling  respectively  propane futures contracts 
fourth  by purchasing propane futures contracts  the company locks in desired prices on forward sales to certain customers 
fifth  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  markwest resources  inc  enters into otc swaps with certain other creditworthy companies to hedge exposure to changes in spot market prices on certain levels of production 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for futures contracts  of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are recognized in revenue and cost of sales upon execution of the hedged physical transaction 
the company had no material notional quantities of natural gas  ngl  or crude oil futures  swaps or options at december  at december   the company had a total of short and long open propane futures contracts representing a notional quantity amounting to  barrels of production 
late in  the company entered into agreements with certain natural gas suppliers for gas purchases  mmbtus a day for the summer of at differentials to crude oil futures and ngl baskets at december  there were no material notional quantities of natural gas or crude oil futures or options at december  during the years ended december  and  a  gain and a million loss  respectively  were recognized in operating income on the settlement of propane and natural gas futures 
financial instrument gains and losses on hedging activities were generally offset by amounts realized from the sale of the underlying products in the physical market 
in addition to these risk management tools  markwest utilizes its liquids storage facilities and contracts for third party storage to build product inventories during historically lower priced periods for resale during higher priced periods 
also  markwest has contractual arrangements to purchase certain quantities of its natural gas feedstock in advance of physical needs 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in the first quarter of  the company began its preliminary assessment of the year issue 
many of the company s computer systems are purchased from third party vendors who have represented to the company that they are year compliant 
a complete analysis  including an evaluation of the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of significant customers and suppliers to properly remediate their own year issue  is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of the outcome of this analysis will be a formal year plan and remediation  if any  is expected to be completed in the company believes that total year project costs will not be material to the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources  and that there should be little impact to the company s computer systems
