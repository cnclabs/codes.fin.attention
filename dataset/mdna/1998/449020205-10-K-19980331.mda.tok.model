item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hytech sells specialty personal care cosmetics products  primarily for skin care  and to a lesser extent oral health care products  most of which are covered by patent  license and royalty agreements 
the renegotiated license agreement provides qvc with certain exclusive rights to purchase certain products solely from hytech for sale in the western hemisphere 
in addition  the patent agreement with national patent provides for reciprocal royalty payments based on the sale of certain of each party s products 
hytech is developing other personal care cosmetics for consumers using hydron polymers 
hytech also uses its patented technology as a drug delivery system in proprietary products  in which hydron polymers act as a drug release mechanism 
hytech intends to continue to explore the efficacy of using its technology for such purposes and would  when appropriate  either seek licensing arrangements with third parties  or develop and market proprietary products through its own efforts 
hytech commenced marketing its skin care product line on qvc in april substantially all of hytech s net sales are derived from sales to qvc under the renegotiated license agreement 
pursuant to the renegotiated license agreement  if qvc fails to meet the stipulated minimum product purchase requirements at the may  measurement date  hytech alone can elect to continue or terminate the agreement 
hytech has not decided what actions  if any  it plans to take under such circumstances

qvc s purchasing patterns are affected primarily by the amount and timing of the hydron care programming 
approximately and of hytech s sales during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were to qvc and its related entities  including the infomercial joint venture and qvc europe 
management anticipates that sales to qvc will continue to be a large percentage of hytech s sales and  absent the consummation of marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties other than qvc  hytech s dependence upon qvc as a substantial customer will remain significant 
any disruption in hytech s relationship with qvc would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of hytech 
hytech s overall gross profit margin increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in catalog sales gross margin of offset in part by a decrease in gross margins on products sold to qvc 
the reduction in gross margins on products sold to qvc relates primarily to fluctuations in the mix of products sold to qvc in those periods 
management anticipates gross profit margins in fiscal of approximately relating to sales to qvc and approximately relating to catalog operations

advertising was the most significant catalog expense  totaling approximately million in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal included in advertising in fiscal and fiscal were sports sponsorship related expenses of approximately  and  respectively 
such sports sponsorships were discontinued during fiscal sg a expenses  other than catalog related expenses  in fiscal were approximately  an increase of approximately  or  from such expenses of  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to legal expenses of approximately  incurred in connection with the dispute between hytech and certain shareholders of hytech including certain current directors of hytech who were members of a group d group through september   including the legal fees and expenses of the d group reimbursed by hytech 
this increase in legal fees was partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in promotional expenses associated with the hydron newsletter sent to qvc customers in fiscal hytech s short term focus is to reduce sg a expenses  primarily relating to the promotion of its catalog operations 
hytech expects sg a expenses to decrease significantly in the first quarter of as the result of  among other things  the cancellation of sport and event sponsorships 
in addition  certain expenses  such as legal fees relating to the matters between hytech and the d group  will not be recurring in fiscal however  hytech will incur legal fees and related expenses in connection with the pending litigation with harvey tauman

hytech had a net loss for fiscal of  a decrease of  or  from the net loss of  for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal 
this increase is primarily the result of qvc s purchasing patterns  along with increased sales to the infomercial partnership and qvc europe 
qvc s purchasing patterns are primarily affected by the timing of the hydron care programming 
approximately and of hytech s sales during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were to qvc and its related entities  including the infomercial partnership and qvc europe 
absent the consummation of marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties other than qvc  the percentage of sales to qvc and hytech s dependence upon qvc as a substantial customer will remain significant 
hytech s gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to fluctuations in the mix of products sold to qvc in those periods  increased sales to the infomercial partnership at lower gross margins  and reduced pricing on products sold to qvc as a result of the amended license agreement

net income for fiscal decreased to a net loss of  from net income of  for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal 
this decrease is primarily the result of qvc s purchasing patterns  partially offset by increased sales to the infomercial partnership and qvc europe 
qvc s purchasing patterns  which are primarily affected by the timing of the hydron care programming  resulted in qvc holding approximately million more of hytech s inventory  at cost  at december  than it held in inventory at december  retail sales of hytech s products on qvc to consumers increased thirty three percent in fiscal over retail sales in fiscal approximately of hytech s sales during fiscal and fiscal were to qvc and its related entities  including the infomercial joint venture and qvc europe 
absent the consummation of marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties other than qvc  the percentage of sales to qvc and hytech s dependence upon qvc as a substantial customer will remain significant 
hytech s gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to fluctuations in the mix of products sold to qvc in those periods 
during fiscal  hytech introduced five new skin care products  three of which were hair care or bath and body products that provide a lower profit margin than hytech s skin care products 
further  management  in conjunction with qvc  made the decision to package several of hytech s individual skin care products into a kit and agreed to price such kit at a substantial discount from the aggregate costs of all of the individual items 
this marketing strategy is a concerted effort by management to further broaden the number of consumers using hytech products  as well as to increase the distribution of the complete hydron product line 
management believes that once consumers sample a wider variety of hytech s products  they are more likely to reorder more of such products  either the entire kit  or individual products at higher prices 
research and development r d expenses reflect hytech s efforts to identify new product opportunities  develop and package the products for commercial sale  perform appropriate efficacy and safety tests  and conduct consumer panel studies and focus groups 
r d expense decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the amount of r d expenses per year varies  depending on the steps taken towards development during such year  as well as the number and type of products under development at such time 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase is attributable to an overall increase in salary requirements  expansion of full time staff  including customer service personnel  and increased advertising expense  primarily relating to the production and mailing of hytech s quarterly newsletter to qvc s hydron customers 
this increase in overall selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a non recurring  predominantly non cash charge in fiscal of approximately  in legal and miscellaneous costs related to the settlement of a lawsuit 
interest and investment income in fiscal increased percent  to  from  in fiscal  resulting from the investment of additional cash from operations 
hytech maintains a conservative investment strategy  deriving investment income primarily from us treasury securities 
net income for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and financial resources hytech s overall financial condition remains strong as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december  working capital at december  was approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
investing activities used  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of leasehold improvements for the expansion hytech s new administrative office 
financing activities in fiscal and fiscal related primarily to the payment of cash dividends totaling  and  respectively 
fiscal financing activities also included the expenditure of  for the purchase of  shares of hytech s common stock at an average price per share of 
in september  hytech s board of directors suspended the quarterly dividends and canceled the stock repurchase program 
fiscal financing activities also generated  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
based on hytech s present cash position  absence of any short or long term debt  arrangements with third parties for contractual manufacturing and r d  and hytech s present business strategy  management believes that hytech has adequate resources to meet normal  recurring obligations as they become due 
further  in view of the thirty day payment terms in connection with sales to qvc  management does not anticipate any difficulty in financing foreseeable inventory requirements 
however  since sales to qvc represent approximately of hytech s net sales for fiscal  termination of the renegotiated license agreement or any significant reduction in the volume of sales to qvc would have a material adverse effect on hytech s business  financial condition and results of operations 
hytech does not have the financial resources to sustain a national advertising campaign to market its products in a conventional retail mode 
in view of the foregoing  management s strategy has been to enter into marketing  licensing and distribution agreements with third parties such as qvc and the infomercial partnership which have greater financial resources than those of hytech and that can enhance hytech s product introductions with appropriate national marketing support programs 
hytech has determined that it will need to modify or replace certain portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
management does not expect that this project will have a significant effect on operations 
while hytech believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which hytech s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on hytech 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to hytech s results of operations or financial position 
the effect of inflation has not been significant upon either the operations or financial condition of hytech
