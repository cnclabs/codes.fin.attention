the proportion of product sales from products based on packet technologies for wide area network applications was approximately in fiscal  approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal product line enhancements and new product lines introduced in fiscal and resulted in increased sales  predominantly through increased acceptance and demand by carriers throughout the world for the company s asynchronous transfer mode atm products 
the proportion of product sales from products based on packet technologies for local area network lan applications was approximately in fiscal  approximately in fiscal and was insignificant in fiscal this sales growth was derived from the acquisition of ub networks in the latter part of fiscal and from continued growth in sales of the company s atm based vivid switched routing products 
sales of circuit switched networking products in fiscal declined relative to sales in fiscal the decline was a reflection of a decrease in sales of the company s circuit switched networking products in europe and latin america and declining business levels in asia in the last half of fiscal sales of these networking products have been and are expected to be subject to potential declines and quarterly variability as customers throughout the world increasingly adopt packet technologies 
in fiscal  sales of circuit switched networking products increased compared to fiscal due to sales increases in asia  latin america and europe 
the company expects the proportion of sales derived from products based on packet technologies to continue to increase relative to sales derived from circuit switched networking products in fiscal when compared to fiscal as a result  sales growth may be reduced due to longer sales cycles often associated with the adoption of new technologies 
the company s sales in fiscal to carriers for applications that provide a range of value added services  such as virtual private networks vpns  wide area network support and internet access  and for resale to end users represented of total sales in fiscal and in fiscal 
the number of networking switches and other products supplied by the company continued to increase in each of the last two fiscal years 
average selling prices declined slightly in fiscal relative to fiscal and in fiscal relative to fiscal  primarily due to discounts on certain large contracts for products for more basic networking applications and the impact on product pricing of increased competition  particularly in the market for products based on packet technologies 
deliveries to original equipment manufacturers oems for carrier customers and deliveries under certain large contracts with carriers contributed significantly to sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal sales to siemens ag and subsidiaries  generally under oem arrangements for resale to end users  were of total sales for fiscal in fiscal and less than in fiscal 
page the company s sales and service functions are divided into three main geographic regions the americas region consisting of north and south america  the european region consisting of europe  the middle east and africa  and the asia pacific region consisting of countries in the asia pacific region and russia 
the percentage of consolidated sales derived by sales management in each geographic region for fiscal  and are set forth below 
fiscal year ended april  americas region european region asia pacific region the company is subject to a degree of variation in quarterly sales as a substantial proportion of sales is derived from less mature markets outside of north america and western europe 
for additional geographic segment information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from products shipped against orders received in each fiscal quarter and from products shipped against firm purchase orders released in that fiscal quarter 
as is prevalent in emerging segments of the networking industry  a disproportionate amount of the company s shipments occur in the third month of each fiscal quarter 
in addition  customers have the ability to revise or cancel orders and change delivery schedules without significant penalty 
as a result  the company operates without significant backlog and schedules some production and budgets expenses based on forecasts of sales  which are difficult to predict 
unforeseen delays in product deliveries or closing large sales  introductions of new products by the company or its competitors  seasonal patterns of customer capital expenditures or other conditions affecting the networking industry in particular or the economy generally during any fiscal quarter could cause quarterly revenue and  to a greater degree  net earnings  to vary greatly 
quarterly operating results are consequently difficult to predict  even towards the end of a given fiscal quarter 
because substantial portions of the company s sales  cost of sales and other expenses are denominated in us dollars and pounds sterling  the company s results of operations are subject to change based on fluctuations in the rates of exchange of those currencies for the canadian dollar 
during fiscal and fiscal  the decrease in the value of the canadian dollar against the pound sterling and the us dollar  relative to exchange rates prevailing in the respective previous years  resulted in no material variance in reported sales  gross margin or income from operations

cost of sales and gross margin fiscal year ended april  canadian dollars in thousands gross margin    as a percentage of sales page cost of sales consists of manufacturing costs  warranty expense and costs associated with the provision of services 
the decline in the gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily the result of the decline in revenues from circuit switched networking products  which carry gross margins above the average gross margins earned on the company s other products  and an increase in the proportion of sales derived from service revenues  which carry gross margins below the average gross margins earned by the company 
the decline in the gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily the result of gross margins earned on product sales and service revenues of ub networks and other companies acquired during fiscal  which have been below the average gross margins earned on the company s other products 
the declines in average selling prices in fiscal relative to fiscal and in fiscal relative to fiscal were generally offset by reductions in per unit costs of manufacturing  resulting in no material impact on gross margins 
many component prices are negotiated by the company with its suppliers 
component price decreases have been principally due to increases in volumes purchased 
shortages of certain components can result in increased component prices 
management expects a continued decline in the proportion of revenues from circuit switched networking products  which have carried gross margins above the average gross margins earned on the company s other products 
in addition  the company believes the impact on product pricing of increased competition  particularly in the market for products based on packet technologies  will constrain the company s ability to maintain gross margins with reductions in per unit costs 
as a result  the gross margin as a percentage of sales is expected to decline in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended april  canadian dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses    as a percentage of sales increase over prior year selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal primarily as a result of increases in sales and service personnel 
the majority of the increases in personnel in fiscal and in fiscal resulted from acquisitions made to enhance the company s business and diversify its marketing and distribution channels 
incremental hiring and spending during fiscal and fiscal were directed at programs to strengthen the company s sales and support infrastructure throughout the world 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal over fiscal and reflects the higher cost structure of companies acquired during fiscal  most significantly the former ub networks which was acquired at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  as well as the result of sequential sales declines in the first three page quarters of fiscal management anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales will decline in fiscal relative to fiscal research and development fiscal year ended april  canadian dollars in thousands gross research and development expenditures    investment tax credits    customer  government and other funding    net deferral amortization of software development costs    net research and development expenses    gross expenditures as a percentage of sales recoveries as a percentage of gross expenditures net research and development expenses as a percentage of sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of software and hardware engineering personnel expenses  costs associated with equipment and facilities  and subcontracted research and development costs 
the increased costs in fiscal and fiscal reflect spending to expand the breadth of network solutions for new value added service capabilities and access technologies  particularly on atm platforms and network and service management software in carrier and carrier access applications 
the majority of the increase was the result of increased engineering personnel 
recoveries decreased as a percentage of gross expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to declines in investment tax credits and in customer  government and other funding as a proportion of gross research and development expenditures 
based on management s estimates of the proportion of fiscal gross research and development expenditures eligible for investment tax credits  and current levels of committed funding  management expects the level of recoveries as a percentage of gross research and development expenditures in fiscal to decline relative to fiscal the markets for the company s products are characterized by continuing technological change 
the company plans to increase net research and development spending in absolute dollars in fiscal to address the requirements of carriers as they invest in new infrastructures to meet the challenges of growing demand for new communications services and increased competition 
purchased research and development in process in november the company acquired a interest in radnet ltd  an israeli developer and manufacturer of access switches for atm networks  for  the majority of the purchase price  was allocated to purchased research and development in process  which was fully amortized over its estimated useful life of six months during the fiscal year ended april  page purchased research and development in process of  in fiscal related to the acquisition of ub networks and was capitalized upon the acquisition 
a review of the recoverability of the purchased research and development in process was undertaken by the company during the fourth quarter of the fiscal  and it was determined that the purchased research and development in process no longer met all the criteria for deferral and accordingly the balance was written off as a charge to net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal under us gaap  research and development in process acquired by the company on the acquisition of radnet and ub networks was written off against net earnings upon acquisition 
restructuring costs in november  the company decided to restructure its activities related to its lan business 
the restructuring plan involves the formation of a strategic alliance with a company strongly positioned in the lan business  and the reduction of the company s direct participation  and related costs  in the lan business 
the company announced its alliance with com corporation in january in repositioning the way in which it addresses the lan market  the restructuring plan created impairment losses on assets associated with the company s lan business and liabilities associated with restructuring activities 
restructuring costs of  recorded in the third quarter of fiscal comprise the following asset impairment losses accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  goodwill ub networks  goodwill ouest standard telematique  other current and non current assets  provision for restructuring reduction in work force  reduction in facilities  discontinued activities  other restructuring costs restructuring costs  asset impairment losses were recorded to the extent the net book value including related reserves exceeded the fair value of any assets associated with the company s restructuring plan 
the fair value was based on the estimated net realizable value of the underlying assets affected by the restructuring 
the full net book value of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of ub networks acquired in january and ouest standard telematique acquired in august were written off as restructuring costs 
both acquisitions related to the company increasing its direct presence and participation in the lan market

the proposed settlement is subject to review and approval by the court on a schedule set by the court 
the company has recorded an expense of  in connection with the proposed settlement  which represents management s estimate of the direct costs which will be incurred upon final approval by the court 
interest and other expenses fiscal year ended april  canadian dollars in thousands interest income    interest expense on long term obligations   other expenses    interest income earned in fiscal and in fiscal decreased as compared to the respective previous fiscal years due to declines in the cash position maintained by the company and due to declines in interest rates earned on investments 
interest expense on long term obligations increased in fiscal and fiscal due to the assumption of long term obligations of companies acquired by the company during fiscal interest expense on long term obligations will increase in fiscal due to the issuance of us  in senior notes due april the increased interest expense is expected to be largely offset by increases in interest income earned on an anticipated higher cash position 
other expenses represented less than of sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal gain on sale of long term investments in january the company sold its minority interest in broadband networks inc  a canadian wireless technology company  to northern telecom limited nortel for proceeds of  the proceeds received included cash of  and nortel shares valued at  the company recognized a gain in fiscal of  representing the excess of the value of the consideration received over the cost to the company of its investment in the broadband networks inc shares exchanged

the company recognized a gain in fiscal on the sale of its insoft shares of  representing the excess of the market value of the shares of the acquirer received over the cost to the company of the insoft shares exchanged 
page income taxes fiscal year ended april  income tax rate income tax rate  excluding non recurring gains and charges the income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal differs from the income tax rate  excluding non recurring gains and charges  due to limits on the deductibility of purchased research and development in process recorded in fiscal and fiscal  and certain elements of restructuring costs recorded in fiscal the composite rates of income tax  excluding non recurring gains and charges  for fiscal  and were reduced from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the application of certain deductions related to manufacturing and processing activities and to research and development expenditures in canada 
future changes in the composite rates of income tax will be primarily due to the relative profitability of operations and the national tax policies in each of the various countries in which the company operates 
management believes that the composite rate of income tax  excluding non recurring gains and charges  will remain lower than the statutory rate because of the deductibility related to manufacturing and processing activities and research and development expenditures in canada as well as other tax planning measures undertaken by the company

accounts receivable as a proportion of revenue increased during fiscal compared to the company s historical levels 
this increase was caused by a decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in an increase in the proportion of the accounts receivable balance represented by sales with extended credit terms 
the company schedules some production of its products based on forecasts of sales  which are difficult to predict 
orders in fiscal did not match forecasts as to quantities and product mix  contributing to an increase in inventory of  management believes that the payment terms and conditions extended to the company s customers  arrangements with the company s suppliers  and the levels of inventory the company carries relative to its levels of sales are consistent with practices generally prevailing in the networking industry
