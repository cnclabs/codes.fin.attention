mainframe nearline product sales generated by the company s applications initiative more than offset decreased sales of earlier generation nearline products and price declines associated with the timberline r revenue associated with network products declined in revenue during was reduced by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements  particularly in europe 
the overall gross profit margin increased during  principally because of increased manufacturing volumes of online products 
revenue increased in compared to  primarily because of increased sales revenue from mainframe nearline products  mainframe online products  client server tape libraries  and application sales 
revenue from older generation nearline products decreased during as compared to revenue from network and other products also declined in as compared to  primarily because of the continued decline in revenue from a number of older network products  the sale of a non strategic network business during the third quarter of  and the sale of substantially all of the company s midrange lease assets and midrange service business in the company s future revenue and operating results are significantly dependent upon the continued demand for mainframe nearline and online products in their traditional markets  expanding the market for and increasing sales of mainframe nearline products and products for the client server environment through the successful development and introduction of new products and applications  expanding marketing and distribution channels  and successfully establishing the company s consulting services business

the company s initiative to develop new applications for its nearline products was a significant contributor to the increase in redwood sales in the company s new applications include document management  scientific applications  check imaging  broadcasting and video solutions  and medical imaging 
unit sales of the timberline  a track cartridge subsystem  increased in  as compared to  but sales revenue decreased as a result of a decline in the average selling price of these products 
sales of the powderhorn  an automated page cartridge system library  and earlier generation nearline products also decreased in as compared to nearline revenue was unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements during revenue from nearline products increased in compared to  primarily because of increased sales revenue from timberline 
redwood  powderhorn and timberwolf also contributed to increased revenue during revenue from earlier generation nearline products decreased in as compared to the company anticipates a slow growth rate in the market for mainframe tape products as customers continue to transition to the client server environment 
future revenue growth for nearline products is dependent upon successfully developing and introducing new nearline products  the continued success of the company s applications development initiative and expanding the indirect distribution channels for the company s client server products through agreements such as the original equipment manufacturer oem agreement with hewlett packard announced in the fourth quarter of in october  the company announced the virtual storage manager vsm  a mainframe data storage management solution designed to improve performance  cartridge utilization  and overall storage management 
failure to timely develop and introduce vsm and other new nearline products and features currently under development may negatively impact the company s results and long term success 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to expand the nearline market through its application development efforts or that it will continue to be successful in expanding the indirect distribution channels for its client server nearline products 
online products revenue from online products increased in as compared to because of increased sales of mainframe online products under the oem agreement with ibm and increased sales of products in the company s openstorage disk subsystem family for the client server market 
revenue from online products increased in as compared to this increase in revenue was primarily because of increased sales volume of mainframe online products under the oem agreement with ibm in the second half of  coupled with end user sales of mainframe online products in the first half of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue contribution from earlier generation online products 
approximately of the company s total revenue during was derived from a worldwide non exclusive oem agreement under which the company develops and manufactures mainframe online storage products for ibm 
in december  the company entered into a new oem agreement with ibm which expires in december ibm is not subject to any long term volume purchase commitments  however  ibm does receive volume purchase discounts under this new agreement 
ibm may elect to terminate the agreement for convenience or for cause  or upon certain instances of change in control or the occurrence of certain other conditions

there can be no assurance that the company will continue to realize benefits associated with the agreement 
see risk factors that may affect future results dependence on ibm  for further discussion of the risks associated with the oem agreement 
the company made significant investments during associated with its entrance into the client server disk market 
success in the client server disk market is critical to the company s page plans to grow revenue in the future 
the company plans to enhance its current product line in with new products which provide the customer with an integrated solution and increase storage management functionality 
in addition to successfully managing the risks associated with introducing these new products  the company must continue to establish new cost effective  high volume distribution channels for these products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its client server disk initiative 
network and other products revenue from network and other products decreased in  as compared to  primarily because of continued declines in sales from network products 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in consulting services revenue 
revenue from network and other products decreased in compared to this decrease was primarily because of the decline in revenue from network products  the sale of a non strategic network business and the sale of the midrange lease assets and the midrange service business 
gross profit overall gross profit margins increased to in  as compared to in and in the increase in was primarily because of increased manufacturing volumes of mainframe online products 
the increase in was primarily because of cost savings achieved in connection with the company s restructuring and increased manufacturing volumes 
gross profit on product sales increased to in  as compared to in  principally as a result of increased manufacturing volumes of mainframe online products  increased sales of higher margin software products and cost reductions associated with the manufacturing process 
product sales margins in also benefited from a change in the classification of advanced manufacturing costs of approximately million  which are included within research and product development costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
gross profit on product sales increased to in  as compared to in  primarily as a result of cost savings achieved in connection with the company s restructuring  increased manufacturing volumes and lower purchase costs associated with components for online and nearline products 
product sales margins in also benefited from reduced sales revenue contribution from lower margin midrange products as a result of the sale of this business 
gross profit on maintenance revenue decreased to in  as compared to in the decline is principally attributable to reduced margins associated with the company s consulting services business 
gross profit on maintenance revenue increased to in  as compared to in this increase is primarily because of continued cost savings associated with the restructuring and reduced maintenance revenue contribution from lower margin midrange services as a result of the sale of the midrange service business in the market for most of the company s products is subject to intense price competition 
the company anticipates it will continue to experience price competition as it expands into the client server storage market 
the company s ability to sustain or improve product sales margins is significantly dependent upon continued success in reducing manufacturing costs in page all of its product lines 
the company anticipates that the product sales margins for its mainframe online products may decline because of volume purchase discounts under the terms of the oem agreement with ibm 
product sales margins also may be affected by inventory reserves and writedowns resulting from rapid technological changes and delays in gaining market acceptance for new products 
maintenance margins may be adversely affected in the future as a result of increased competition and lower margins associated with mainframe products and the company s consulting services business 
research and product development research and product development expenditures increased in  as compared to research and product development costs for include incremental costs of approximately million because of a change in the classification of costs associated with certain advanced manufacturing activities that were previously included within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
after considering this reclassification  research and product development costs were relatively unchanged in  as compared to increased investments during in developing new client server tape and disk products  and new mainframe nearline products were offset by the receipt of additional funding from ibm for certain research and development activities on mainframe online products under the terms of the oem agreement 
research and product development expenditures decreased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of research and development funding from ibm 
the company s research and development costs in will be affected by the level of funding received from ibm and other partners for the development of new products 
the company anticipates that its research and development costs will increase during as it focuses on developing new mainframe products and products designed for the client server market 
marketing  general  administrative and other marketing  general  administrative and other income and expense mg a increased in  as compared to the increase is primarily because of spending on internal business and financial information systems  employee profit sharing and bonus expenses associated with increased earnings levels  and marketing expenses associated with the company s client server storage initiative 
the increase was partially offset by gains realized on the sale of accounts receivable of million in mg a remained relatively unchanged in  as compared to  as cost savings associated with the restructuring were partially offset by increased marketing expenses

see liquidity and capital resources working capital  for further discussion of the company s stock repurchase plan 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the currently available information  management has determined that the company will more likely than not realize million of deferred income tax assets as of december  the company s valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   was established based upon the consideration of a variety of factors  including the company s earnings history  the number of years the company s operating loss and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  near term expectations  and the highly competitive nature of the high technology marketplace 
the company anticipates that the effective tax rate will exceed the us federal income tax rate of in as the company has recognized substantially all of its remaining net deductible temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards in the united states 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   consisted of the following in thousands of dollars restructuring charges  litigation settlement  merger and consolidation charges  page the following table summarizes the activity in the company s restructuring reserves in thousands of dollars employee asset lease other severance writedowns abandonments exit costs total balances  december      restructuring charges      cash payments     asset writedowns   balances  december      cash payments     reclassifications   balances  december      cash payments    reclassifications     balances  december     restructurings during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with the adoption of a formal action plan for restructuring its enterprise and network businesses 
the restructuring was adopted in an effort to establish a more cost efficient business structure in response to competition 
elements of the company s restructuring plan included focusing on core businesses and outsourcing non strategic activities  rearchitecting its distribution processes and channels  and accelerating the integration of network systems corporation  which was acquired in march reclassifications were made in and to reflect revised estimates of the various components of the restructuring 
reclassifications had no effect on the consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining restructuring reserves relate principally to the company s plans to further integrate its sales administration organization and rearchitect its distribution processes in the united states and europe 
while the majority of these remaining accruals are expected to result in future cash outflows  these outflows are not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity 
the company believes that its restructuring programs have eliminated certain non essential functions and excess costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s restructuring activities will be successful or sufficient to allow the company to continue to generate improved operating results in future periods 
it is possible that changes in the company s business or in its industry may necessitate restructuring charges in the future 
page liquidity and capital resources working capital the company s cash balances decreased million from december   to december  cash generated from operations of million during was more than offset by the cash used to repurchase million of the company s common shares 
net purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and an increase in short term investments of million also contributed to the decrease in cash balances during in october  the company announced a plan to repurchase up to million of its common stock through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions 
in connection with the plan announced in october  the company repurchased and retired million shares of its common stock during pursuant to a privately negotiated transaction  resulting in an initial cash outflow of million 
the final purchase price of the common stock is subject to adjustment based on the trading price of the common stock during a defined period 
any price adjustment will be reflected as an adjustment to capital in excess of par value on the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity 
repurchases of common stock associated with the plan announced in october are expected to be completed by the end of in february  the company announced a program to repurchase up to million shares of common stock on an annual basis 
as of december   the company had repurchased million shares of common stock under this program  resulting in a total cash outflow of million 
the company s cash balances increased million from december   to december  the increase in cash balances in primarily resulted from cash generated from operations of million  which was offset by net repayments of debt of million  the repurchase of million shares of common stock for a purchase price of approximately million  investments in property  plant and equipment of million and an increase of short term investments of million 
net cash from operating activities during includes cash received from the sale of lease assets and cash payments associated with the restructuring 
the current ratio decreased to as of december   from as of december   primarily because of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased from million as of december   to million as of december   primarily as a result of increased sales revenue and a receivable from ibm which was collected in january inventories decreased from million as of december   to million as of december   principally as a result of a reduction in raw materials and benefits associated with a recently implemented finished goods inventory delivery process 
available financing lines in  the company replaced its million unsecured credit agreement with a million unsecured credit agreement which expires in october the revolver 
the credit limit available under the revolver will be reduced by million on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning december  the interest rates under the revolver depend on the type of advance selected 
the basic advance rate is no less than the london interbank offered rate libor plus as of december  
under the revolver  the company is required to comply with certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
as of december   the page company had issued letters of credit for approximately million and had approximately million of available credit under the revolver 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank which provides for the sale of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
the agreement  which expires in july  provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
the notes must be repaid only to the extent of future revenue of the company and obligations under the agreement are not cancelable by the company or the bank 
transaction gains and losses related to the notes are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment 
the promissory notes  together with accrued interest  are payable in us dollars within days from the date of issuance and bear interest at rates no less than the libor rate plus as of december  
under the terms of the agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants which include the maintenance of a collateral account  including cash and qualifying investments  in an amount of no less than the outstanding promissory notes 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings and had committed to borrowings between january and december in the cumulative principal amount of approximately million 
the company had a financing agreement with a bank which provided for the sale of certain us and foreign based accounts receivable on a recourse basis which expired on january  this agreement allowed for receivable sales of up to million at any one time with the company s obligations under the agreement secured by a letter of credit for the amount of the receivables sold 
the selling price of the receivables was partially determined based upon foreign currency exchange rates  and any gains or losses on the sales were recognized within mg a in the consolidated statement of operations at the time the receivables were sold 
during  the company sold approximately million of receivables in connection with this agreement 
as of december   the outstanding balance associated with receivables sold on a recourse basis  but not collected  was approximately million 
as of december   the company had committed to receivable sales of approximately million 
gains and losses associated with receivable sales did not have a material effect on the company s reported financial results after taking into consideration other transactions associated with the company s international operations 
the company intends to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development projects and may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company believes it has adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
over the longer term  the company may choose to fund these activities through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  can be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
total debt to total capitalization the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio decreased from as of december   to as of december  as a result of the conversion of the company s convertible debentures in page international operations during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue was generated by its international operations 
the decrease in is principally because of the oem sales of mainframe online products to ibm  which occurred domestically in the company s international operating income includes million of expense associated with the transfer of technology to a wholly owned subsidiary in anticipation of a future off shore manufacturing operation 
the company expects that a significant portion of revenue will be generated from international operations in the future 
the majority of the company s international operations involves transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally germany  france and the united kingdom  japan  canada and australia 
an increase in the exchange value of the us dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by the company s international operations 
as a result  the company s operating and financial results can be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company employs a hedging program which utilizes foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts 
see market risk management foreign currency exchange risk  below 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from localized economic and market conditions 
for example  in the past  the company s business has been adversely affected by weak economic conditions in europe 
the company does not currently anticipate that the economic crisis in asia will have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial results 
the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  tariffs  quotas  difficulty in obtaining export licenses  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors outside the company s control 
there can be no assurances that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results in the future 
market risk management foreign currency exchange risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments relates primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company seeks opportunities to reduce exposures through financing activities and utilizes foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts to further reduce any remaining exposures 
all foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are authorized and executed pursuant to the company s policies 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts that are designated as and qualify as hedging transactions are subject to hedge accounting treatment 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments  foreign currency options or forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s financial instruments and off balance sheet risks 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank which provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
transaction gains and losses related to the notes are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment 
see available financing lines above for further discussions of the financing agreement 
page the company periodically utilizes foreign currency options  generally with maturities of less than one year  to hedge a portion of its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated revenue from its international operations 
gains and losses associated with the options are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the associated revenue at the same time as the underlying anticipated transactions 
to the extent that an option which qualified for hedge accounting is terminated or ceases to be effective as a hedge  any deferred gains and losses up to that point continue to be deferred and are recognized as an adjustment to the associated revenue 
the company also utilizes forward exchange contracts  generally with maturities of less than two months  to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and anticipated revenues from its international operations 
the carrying amounts of these forward foreign exchange contracts equal their fair value as the contracts are adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities are recognized as incurred within mg a on the consolidated statement of operations as adjustments to the foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of net monetary assets 
gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge anticipated revenue are recognized as incurred as an adjustment to revenue 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates applied to the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments held as of december   would result in a hypothetical loss of approximately million 
this hypothetical loss does not take into consideration the company s underlying international operations 
the company anticipates that any hypothetical loss associated with the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments would be offset by gains associated with its underlying international operations 
risk factors that may affect future results new products  markets and distribution channels the company s results of operations and competitive strength depend upon its ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market innovative new products and product enhancements 
short product life cycles are inherent to the high technology market 
the company must devote significant resources to research and product development projects and effectively manage the risks inherent in new product transitions 
developing new technology and products is complex and involves uncertainties 
delays in product development  manufacturing  or in customer purchasing decisions can make product transitions difficult 
in addition  product transitions make the process of production and inventory planning more difficult as the company must accurately anticipate product mix and configuration demands  and accurately forecast inventory levels 
the company has experienced product development delays in the past that adversely affected the company s financial results and competitive position 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully manage the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements in the future 
the company historically has generated a significant portion of its revenue and operating profits from mainframe products 
the rate of growth in the mainframe market has slowed as a result of customers shifting their storage requirements from the mainframe to the client server environment 
the company s future financial results are significantly dependent upon successfully introducing new products for the client server environment 
the company page currently is making significant investments in research and development activities focused on new products for the client server markets currently planned for introduction in the company must also establish new cost effective  high volume distribution channels for these products 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these activities 
the company also has implemented an applications development initiative  which is intended to develop new applications for its products 
the new applications initiative was successful in developing new markets for the company s mainframe nearline products during however  there can be no assurances that the company s client server products and applications development activities will result in increased revenue and profitability during in the fourth quarter of  the company reorganized its sales and support field operations in north america 
in europe  the company is implementing a pan european sales and service model 
these new structures are designed to align the sales and support functions with the company s business group model that focuses on specific market segments 
the company believes the reorganization will allow it to more effectively deliver information storage solutions to its customers and achieve cost savings 
the reorganization may cause temporary disruptions in sales and support field operations and may adversely affect the company s revenue and operating results 
the company s greater dependence on indirect distribution channels  such as oems and value added resellers  will make production and inventory planning more complex 
in the event an indirect partner establishes a new relationship with a competitor or experiences financial difficulties  the company s operating and financial results may be adversely affected 
see dependence on ibm  below  for a discussion of issues associated with the company s distribution channels for its mainframe online products 
dependence on ibm in  approximately of the company s total revenue was derived from oem sales of mainframe online products to ibm 
the company currently anticipates that it will derive a significant portion of its sales revenue in from product sales to ibm 
under the worldwide  non exclusive oem agreement entered into during december  ibm is not subject to any long term volume purchase commitments  however  ibm does receive volume purchase discounts 
ibm may terminate the agreement under certain conditions 
the company s success under the oem agreement is significantly dependent upon achieving certain product development  delivery and performance milestones 
the company s success is also dependent upon ibm continuing to successfully market the mainframe online products  and developing and delivering to the company disk drives for inclusion in the products 
because of the volume purchase discounts included in the oem agreement  the company must continue to reduce costs and expenses associated with manufacturing the products in order to achieve the expected benefits 
the oem relationship may also cause the company to incur additional costs associated with unanticipated increases or decreases in manufacturing and inventory volumes 
there can be no assurances that the company will achieve the milestones contained in the oem agreement or that ibm will successfully market these products in the future 
in december  the company and ibm agreed to a settlement with the united states department of justice doj concerning the company s oem relationship with ibm 
the terms of the settlement are contained in a proposed consent decree which was filed with the us district court for the district of columbia on december  the proposed consent decree will be effective upon approval by the court 
the court is expected to issue a ruling in page march under the terms of the proposed consent decree  which will expire in december  the company must develop new distribution channels for its online products during or the company will be subject to limitations on its sales to ibm in the future 
the company s oem agreement with ibm expires in december and ibm has indicated that it is currently developing a competitive online product 
failure to develop new distribution channels for the company s mainframe online products could adversely affect the company s ability to sell its mainframe online products in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the doj investigation 
competition the markets for the company s products and services are intensely competitive 
in the mainframe market  the company s traditional competitors include ibm  emc  fujitsu and hitachi 
in an effort to increase the rate of revenue growth and profitability  the company has entered the client server storage market 
competition in the client server market comes from the company s traditional rivals  in addition to companies focused on the client server industry  such as sun microsystems  compaq and hewlett packard 
a number of the company s competitors have significantly greater market presence and financial resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s potential customers in the client server market purchase their storage requirements as part of a packaged server and storage product  which may provide a competitive advantage to the company s rivals 
the company expects to address this issue by providing superior storage solutions that operate across multiple computer platforms and by establishing distribution relationships with these competitors 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully compete against other companies in the mainframe and client server market 
patents and licenses the company s patents and other proprietary rights are material assets and key elements of the business and competitive strength 
the company protects its proprietary information through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  confidentiality procedures  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements 
the company s policy is to apply for patents  or other appropriate proprietary or statutory protection in the united states and other selected countries to establish its proprietary rights in new and improved technology 
there can be no assurances  however  that these arrangements will successfully preclude competitors from developing products similar to the company s products  or that the company s proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  or that these rights will provide significant competitive advantages 
the company also relies on technology that is licensed from others  such as ibm 
the company is unable to predict whether its licensing arrangements can be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to the company 
in order to protect and enforce its proprietary rights  from time to time the company has commenced legal actions against other companies 
similarly  other companies have brought legal actions against the company claiming infringement of patent or other proprietary rights 
licenses or royalty arrangements are generally offered in these situations 
however  any litigation by or against the company  with or without merit  may result in significant expense and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against the company  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or discontinue the use of certain processes if the company is unable to enter into royalty arrangements 
as a result of an page increasingly complex and diverse competitive environment  the company anticipates that the volume of proprietary rights claims will grow 
there can be no assurances that litigation will not be commenced against the company in the future involving patents  copyrights  trademarks or trade secrets  or that the company will be able to obtain any licensing  royalty or other rights on acceptable terms 
the company currently is involved in legal proceedings involving its proprietary rights and alleging patent infringement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to these legal proceedings 
volatility of stock price  earnings fluctuations the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
industry conditions  new product or product development announcements by the company or its competitors  announced acquisitions and joint ventures by the company or its competitors  broad market trends unrelated to the company s performance  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are among the factors that can affect the company s stock price 
in addition  if the company s reported operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  there could be an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
fluctuations are caused by factors such as customers historical tendencies to make purchase decisions near the end of the quarter  the timing of the announcement and availability of new products by the company and its competitors  fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the mix and configuration of products sold  rapid price erosion  the purchasing patterns of the company s oem partners and global economic conditions 
sole source suppliers the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products and believes that  in most cases  there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
certain of the company s key components and products are purchased from single suppliers that the company believes are currently the only manufacturers of the particular components that meet the company s qualification requirements and other specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
in particular  a key component of the company s tape drive heads is supplied by sumitomo corporation on a sole source basis and the company is dependent on ibm for disk drives used in products manufactured for ibm under an oem agreement 
certain of the company s suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial or other problems in the past that have delayed deliveries  but without significant effect on the company 
an unanticipated failure of any sole source supplier to meet the company s requirements for an extended period  or an interruption in the company s ability to secure comparable components  could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue and operating results 
in the event a sole source supplier was unable or unwilling to continue to supply components  the company would have to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available or would be able to satisfy the company s production requirements on a timely basis 
page risks associated with the year the company s product lines include information storage systems and network products which store  retrieve and transmit data 
in order to properly process data  the company s products must manage and manipulate data that includes both th and st century dates year compliant 
the company believes its current products are year compliant provided they have been upgraded to include all recommended engineering changes 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products will be year compliant
