seasonality the business of the company is highly seasonal 
approximately of the company s revenues are generated during the six month period of april through september

furthermore  since many of the attractions at the parks involve outdoor activities  prolonged periods of inclement weather result in a substantial reduction of revenues during such period 
inflation the effects of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the consumer price index  have not had a material impact on the company s revenues or net income in recent years
