item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its financial commitments 
the major needs for cash are to enable central to pay claims and expenses as they come due 
central s primary sources of cash are premiums and investment income 
central s payments consist of current claim payments to insureds  managed care expenses  operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  commissions  taxes  etc  and shareholder dividends payable to the company 
the company has  in the past  relied on the dividend from central to enable it to pay dividends to shareholders 
central and the company discontinued paying dividends at the end of and no dividends were paid in by statute  the state regulatory authorities set minimum liquidity standards to protect both policyholders and shareholders and limit the dividends payable by central to the company 
see item the majority of the company s assets are in investments which were  after a net unrealized holding gain before taxes of  of  see below  or of the total assets at december  fixed maturities are the primary investment of the company and were  or of total investments at december  other investments consist of short term securities and policy loans 
the company is carrying fixed maturities of  at amortized cost held to maturity and fixed maturities of  at estimated fair value available for sale at december  the company does not hold any so called junk bonds or what are generally considered high yield type securities  and of the bonds are of investment grade quality 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company recorded an increase in investments of  to reflect the reporting of investments classified as available for sale at fair value estimated market value which was higher than amortized cost 
the amount is reflected in shareholders equity as a net unrealized holding gain  net of  for taxes 
in addition to the fixed maturities  the company also had million in unrestricted cash and million in short term investments at december  during  total assets increased about million  however this was offset by an increase in total liabilities of about million after debt 
the major reasons for the increase in assets was due to the reinsurance treaty with hannover and the million note payable 
the company suffered a large negative cash flow in from the operations of central 
see consolidated cash flow financial statements 
the negative cash flow was primarily generated from claim payments  much of what was due to a run off of claims due to lapses 
although the majority of the lapsed policies had high loss ratios  new business did not offset the lapses enough to produce a positive cash flow 
the company anticipates that with the changes made during and into  that future operating cash flow needs  including surrenders of annuity policies  can be provided from premiums and the current investment portfolio 
liabilities accrued for future policy benefits and policy claims payable increased to  at december  from  in or about million 
certain group accident and health reserves increased approximately million  to million from million  however this increase was offset by surrenders of annuity policies during the year 
shareholders equity decreased to  due to the operating loss  which included the strengthening of reserves and costs incurred relative to seeking additional capital 
although the company s consolidated equity was  including unrealized gain of  central s statutory capital and surplus was  at december  central s capital and surplus includes the million surplus note and the benefit of the million ceding allowance from the hannover reinsurance treaty 
capital resources central  the major operating subsidiary  suffered a large decrease in its statutory capital and surplus in which was primarily due to the  statutory loss 
this decrease caused central to fall under the regulatory action level ral imposed by the ohio department of insurance under the recently adopted risk based capital rbc requirements on insurance enterprises 
early in  am best lowered central s rating from b to b due to the losses and decrease in capital and surplus in central continued to have losses in due to an increase in claim payments and a decrease in premiums  due to lapses  and a decrease in new business written 
because of the financial problems of central  the company engaged an investment banker to seek additional capital 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into the original stock purchase agreement with strategic acquisition partners strategic partners pursuant to which the company would issue and sell  common shares and warrants to purchase an additional  common shares at an exercise price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of  on march   the company revised its agreement with strategic partners and entered into an amended and restated stock purchase agreement the new stock purchase agreement with strategic partners and two additional investors  insurance partners  lp and insurance partners offshore bermuda  lp collectively  insurance partners 
pursuant to the new stock purchase agreement  the company will issue and sell  common shares at per share and warrants to purchase an additional  common shares at an exercise price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of  the company hopes to obtain shareholder and regulatory approval and to close the transaction by june  concurrent with the signing of the original stock purchase agreement  strategic partners arranged for an interim loan of million to the company 
the loan is due june  and bears interest at the prime rate 
proceeds from the loan  received in december  were used to pay off a million bank loan and a contribution of million  in the form of a surplus note  to central 
if shareholder approval of the equity financing transaction the equity financing is not obtained  the  note evidencing the bridge financing the bridge note and  of the  guarantee warrants  which have already been issued in connection with the bridge financing  will remain outstanding and enforceable against the company 
the bridge note matures on june   at which time the company will be required to repay the loan evidenced by the bridge note 
because of regulatory restrictions  it is highly unlikely the company could receive the funds to repay the bridge note from central 
thus  if shareholder approval of the equity financing is not obtained  it is likely that the company will not have the ability to repay its obligations under the bridge note and will be required immediately to locate an alternate source of financing to meet its obligations under the bridge note and to fund its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such a refinancing at all or on terms that are favorable to the company or its shareholders  particularly in light of central s current financial position and its recent efforts to obtain financing 
the company s failure to obtain sufficient financing within the requisite time may entitle strategic partners to exercise its rights as a secured creditor  including by foreclosing upon all of the common shares of central which were pledged to strategic partners as collateral for the bridge financing 
as the company is a holding company with no operations and limited assets  such foreclosure upon the company s principal asset could result in the common shares having little or no value  make it impossible for the company to continue operations  and or force the company to seek protection under federal bankruptcy law 
the company believes that if the equity financing is approved and consummated  its effect  together with the financial transactions described above and below  recent expense reductions  and internally generated funds  should enable the company to finance the planned growth for the foreseeable future 
if additional funds are required for long term growth  the company believes that these funds could be obtained through equity or debt offerings as market conditions permit or dictate 
also in december  central entered into a reinsurance treaty with reassurance company of hannover hannover 
the reinsurance is on a quota share basis on certain group accident and health policies in force and written during the treaty provided an initial ceding allowance of million which increased the surplus of central 
the combination of the surplus note and the ceding allowance added million to the statutory capital and surplus of central 
the reinsurance treaty also reduced central s risk exposure under rbc by approximately and with the additional surplus placed central above the action levels under rbc at december  the only long term debt the company had at december   was  which is the principal amount payable under a loan secured by a mortgage on the company s home office building 
the company entered into the loan agreement in for million for a term of years bearing interest at per annum with a year amortization period payment schedule 
at the same time  the company also entered into a year lease agreement with central for of the space 
the company will use the monthly rental payments to pay  among other expenses  the required mortgage loan payments 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company entered into an administrative services agreement in march to outsource its computer operations with an independent vendor 
the vendor is already in compliance with the year issue  so there should be no material additional costs incurred by the company for the year issue 
results of operations compared to during premiums increased slightly to  from  the group life and health segment accounted for of the premiums in the group certificates in force decreased about to  in compared to  at the end of certificates issued for new group policies were  in  down from  in total lapses net of additions decreases in were  up from  in overall the major reason for the flat growth in premiums  decrease in certificates and increase in lapses can be attributed to the financial condition of central in and the large losses and related decrease in statutory surplus discouraged new business and required large rate increases 
although unprofitable business did terminate  it terminated faster than new profitable business was being issued 
the lowering of central s am best rating  to b from b  also had a negative effect on the sale of ordinary life and annuity policies during with the addition of million to central s statutory surplus from the surplus note of million  to the company  and the million resulting from a reinsurance treaty  the company anticipates an increase in new business certificates and a return to a normal lapse ratio in and future years 
net investment income decreased about to  in from  in a decrease in invested assets and a negative cash flow in were the primary reasons for the decrease 
benefits and claims incurred expenses increased in to  in from  in the incurred loss ratio was for compared to for the major reasons for the increase in the claims loss ratio and the level of claims incurred are a the continued effect of an underpriced product sold heavily in  b a larger number of unexpected and unanticipated prior year claims paid in  resulting in a reserve deficiency of approximately million  c larger number of annuity policies lapsed than anticipated  d a run off in claims due to rate renewal actions and e a reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of with the combination of the reserve strengthening  rate renewal actions and benefit changes  the company anticipates a lower loss ratio in future years 
commissions remained fairly level in   compared to  in primarily due to premiums remaining flat 
operating expenses increased to  or of premiums in compared to  or of premiums in although salaries  benefits and premium taxes remain the largest portions of the total operating expenses  other operating expenses increased due to the costs incurred relative to seeking additional funds for capital and surplus during for central 
interest expense increased to  from  in the increase was due to the million loan in june and the million loan in december the million loan was paid off in december the net loss for was  or per share compared to  or per share in the company s revenues increased approximately  however claims and expenses increased over million  the majority being in claims 
central s group accident and health business represented of the revenues and a higher loss ratio from this segment has a negative effect on earnings 
the statutory loss ratio for the group accident and health segment increased to in compared to in although the losses were higher in  central received million from the company and issued a surplus note for the million and received a million ceding allowance from a reinsurance treaty  both of which increased central s statutory capital and surplus 
at december   central s statutory capital and surplus was  which was above any regulatory action levels 
the federal income tax returns for the company and its subsidiaries have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for and during the third quarter of  the irs issued a proposal for adjustments to the company s returns for and the proposed deficiencies were approximately million of which  was paid in and  paid in the balance primarily deals with whether or not the company s primary subsidiary  central  qualified as a life company  for tax purposes 
the company is vigorously protesting the proposed deficiency and based on discussions with counsel management believes existing law supports the company s position 
therefore  the company has not recorded a liability for the difference 
the tax case is currently on the may  trial calendar of the united states tax court at cleveland  ohio  but it is expected that the case will be submitted as a legal issue  ie  without the need for a trial 
if the irs were to prevail in its position that central no longer qualifies as a life company for tax purposes  approximately million of tax and interest would be payable and federal income taxes would increase in the future 
presently  as a small life company  central is permitted  among other things  a deduction from the first million of income of or million 
as central s income increases above million  the special deduction is reduced proportionately 
besides relying on favorable existing case law  central may have  under certain circumstances  the ability to change and market policies that could insure its qualifications as a life company for tax purposes in the future  if the need arises 
results of operations compared to during  premiums increased to  from  in the increase was primarily in the group life and health segment which accounted for about of total premiums 
group certificates in force increased about to  in compared to  at the end of certificates issued for new group policies were  in  down from  in a more aggressive pricing in and additional competition were the cause for the decrease 
total lapses net of additions decreases in were  up slightly from  in overall  the lapse ratio was in line with the company s expectations and consistent with the industry average for small group business 
not included in premiums  for generally accepted accounting principles gaap purposes  were annuity considerations in the amounts of  and  for and net investment income increased about to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to an increase in rates 
the company continued to invest in short term investments to provide any cash requirements needed for claims 
benefits and claims incurred expenses increased in to  from  in the incurred loss ratio was for compared to for the major reasons for the increase in the claims loss ratio and the level of claims were a the underpricing  as a result of inaccurate actuarial and managerial projections and conclusions  of a new product pmo introduced in late and sold heavily in  accounting for of certificates issued  b greater utilization than anticipated and c new state mandates such as guaranteed issue not subject to medical underwriting and preventive benefits  which are medical services that are not for the care  treatment or diagnosis of an illness 
by far the biggest cause was the underpriced pmo product which contributed to an estimated of the loss before net investment income 
the losses on the new product were recognized in the year the claims were reported and through actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
higher premiums and aggressive rate renewal actions started april  because the business is primarily sold on a monthly basis the full renewal action took months ending march  in the risk based capital rbc plan that central filed on march  with the ohio department of insurance odi  central identified certain conditions that contributed to the regulatory action level ral difficulties 
the rbc financial plan identified the following conditions a the pmo product  which was found to be underpriced  was introduced in late and sold heavily in  b the harsh winter of  causing numerous accidents and related heart conditions  c greater utilization causing an increase in claims processed  d state mandates requiring guaranteed issue  e state mandated benefits  and f the medical trend was higher than expected 
the conditions increased central s claims expense thereby increasing its losses and reducing its capital and surplus below the levels required under the rbc rules 
the company took certain remedial steps  increasing the rates being charged for the new product and increasing the renewal rates as policyholders anniversary dates arrived 
the interim targets established by central were designed to increase the rates on a monthly basis over a twelve month period to complete the renewal of all policyholders of the pmo product 
at the end of march   central reached its target of increasing rates for all renewal policyholder plans since the rate actions started on april  commissions increased to  in from  in primarily due to the increase in premiums 
as a percentage of premiums they were in and in other operating expenses increased to  or of premiums in  compared to  or of premiums in salaries  benefits and premium taxes remained the largest portions of the other operating expenses 
the net loss for was  or per share  after a net tax benefit of  compared to a net income of  or per share after a tax expense of  in because group accident and health represents of central s business  a higher loss ratio from this segment has a negative effect on the company s earnings 
the statutory loss ratio in the group accident and health segment increased to in from in impact of inflation inflation rates impact the company s financial condition and operating results in several areas 
changes in inflation rates impact the market value of the investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
inflation has had an impact on claim costs and overall operating costs and although it has been lower in the last few years  hospital and medical costs have still increased at a higher rate than general inflation 
while to a certain extent these increased costs are offset by interest rates investment income  hospital charges increased  while the rate of income from investments has not increased proportionately 
the company will continue to establish premium rates in accordance with trends in hospital and medical costs along with concentrating on various cost containment programs 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts by the company will fully offset the impact of inflation or that premiums will equal or exceed increasing health care costs 
legislative developments in congress passed the health portability and accountability act of  which provides for changes in the health insurance market and went into effect in july it guarantees the availability and renewability of health insurance coverage for certain employees and individuals  and limits the use of preexisting condition restrictions 
the act creates federal standards for insurers  health maintenance organizations hmo s  and employer plans  including those who self insure 
it permits  however  substantial state flexibility for compliance with the requirements on insurers 
the company cannot predict the ultimate timing or effect of any legislative efforts  and no assurance can be given that any such efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards statement  accounting for stock based compensation  which was effective for the company for the year ended december  the statement prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock based compensation plans  including employee stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
statement allows for either the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation or the continued use of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company has elected to continue to comply with apb no 
the company has not granted any new stock options subsequent to january   therefore  the pro forma disclosures required by statement are not applicable 
in june  fasb issued statement  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
statement provides new accounting and reporting standards for sales  securitizations  and servicing of receivables and other financial assets  for certain secured borrowing and collateral transactions  and for extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  statement  deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of fasb statement no 
 was issued in december the impact of statement and statement is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements 
in  fasb issued statement no 
 earnings per share 
statement replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share 
unlike primary earnings per share  basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options  warrants and convertible securities 
diluted earnings per share is very similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings per share 
all earnings per share amounts for all periods have been presented  and where appropriate  restated to conform to statement requirements 
in  fasb issued statement no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure 
statement  which is applicable to all companies  consolidates the existing guidance in the authoritative literature relating to an entity s capital structure 
capital structure disclosures required by statement include liquidation preferences of preferred stock  information about the pertinent rights and privileges of the outstanding equity securities  and the redemption amounts for all issues of capital stock that are redeemable at fixed or determinable prices on fixed or determinable dates 
statement is effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  and is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements 
in  fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
statement establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
it does not apply to not for profit entities 
disclosure of total comprehensive income is required in interim period financial statements 
the new rules require that all items that are recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the rules require companies to a display items of other comprehensive income either below the total for net income  in a separate statement of comprehensive income  or in a statement of changes in equity  the alternative we believe many companies will follow  and b disclose the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
statement does not specify a format for the financial statement that portrays the components of comprehensive income but requires that a company display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the periods reported in that financial statement 
the final statement eliminated the proposed requirement to display comprehensive income per share because of the overwhelming negative response the fasb received related to this matter 
application of statement will not impact amounts previously reported for net income or affect the comparability of previously issued financial statements 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is not considered to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in  fasb issued statement no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
statement significantly changes the way public companies report segment information in annual financial statements and also requires those companies to report selected segment information in interim financial reports to shareholders 
the statement supersedes fasb statement on segments 
it does not apply to nonpublic enterprises or to not for profit organizations 
the fasb concluded that the industry segment approach to reporting segment information under statement is not providing the information required by financial statement users 
under statement s management approach  public companies will report financial and descriptive information about their operating segments 
operating segments are revenue producing components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and are subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
in response to constituent concerns  the fasb added quantitative thresholds  similar to the statement guidelines  to determine if a segment must be reported 
statement is effective for years beginning after december  the company believes the information required for segment disclosure is available and compliance with statement will not be a problem
