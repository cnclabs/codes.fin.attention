item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company provides integrated facility development  design  construction and operational services to governmental agencies within three areas of operational focus 
the following table sets forth the number of facilities and beds under contract or award at the end of the periods shown 
december  facilities in operation total offender capacity residential    non residential community based total    beds under contract end of period    contracted beds in operation end of period    average occupancy based on contracted beds in operation as of december   the company had facilities in operation and contracts to operate two additional facilities under development 
of the facilities  are non residential community based facilities 
for any applicable facilities  includes reduced occupancy during the start up phase 
occupancy percentages are based on contracted offender capacity of residential facilities in operation 
since certain facilities have offender capacities that exceed contracted capacities  occupancy percentages can exceed of contracted capacity 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from operating correctional  detention and pre release facilities for federal  state and local governmental agencies in the united states 
revenues for operation of correctional  detention and pre release facilities are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days for the period 
factors which the company considers in determining the per diem rate to charge include i the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  ii wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  iii whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and iv the anticipated average occupancy levels which the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
the company s operating margins generally vary from facility to facility regardless of whether the facility is secure institutional  pre release or juvenile based on the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility and the anticipated changes in operating costs  if any  over the term of the contract 
the company incurs all facility operating expenses  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to facilities for which the company has only a management contract three facilities in operation at december  
a majority of the company s facility operating expenses consist of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating expenses increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating expenses depends on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
these variable operating expenses include food  medical services  supplies and clothing 
the company s largest single operating expense  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust the staffing and payroll to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  but a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
since a majority of the company s operating expenses are fixed  to the extent that the company can increase revenues at a facility through higher occupancy or expansion of the number of beds under contract  the company should be able to improve operating results 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  accounting  finance  personnel and other services and costs of developing new contracts 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving offenders 
offenders are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to three month period 
the company may incur operating losses at new facilities until break even occupancy levels are reached 
quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as development and construction of new facilities and by expenses incurred by the company including the cost of options to purchase or lease proposed facility sites and the cost of engaging outside consultants and legal experts related to submitting responses to rfp s 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company commencing management of a new facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
results of operations the company s historical operating results reflect that the company has significantly expanded its business since material fluctuations in the company s results of operations are principally the result of the timing and effect of acquisitions and the level of development activity conducted by the company and occupancy rates at company operated facilities 
the company s acquisitions to date have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the operating results of the acquired businesses have been reported in the company s operating results since the date of acquisition 
the company s income from operations as a percentage of revenues fluctuates depending on the relative mix of operating contracts among the company s three areas of operational focus 
since pre release facilities involve contracts with a fewer number of beds than secure institutions  fluctuations in the occupancy levels in such facilities have a more significant impact on their operating margins 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentages of revenues represented by certain items in the company s historical consolidated statements of operations
