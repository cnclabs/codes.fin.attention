item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
business outlook and risk factors fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to several factors  including  without limitation  the volume and timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers  the cancelation or rescheduling of customer orders  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  the gain or loss of significant customers  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  level and value of the company s inventories  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  customer delays in qualification of new products  increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations  especially declines  in the average selling prices received for its products  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its competitors products  the long sales cycles associated with the company s products  cyclical conditions in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and other factors 
for example  net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million compared to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal due  in part  to the factors described above 
a significant portion of the company s operating and manufacturing expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
if the company is unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected future sales shortfall  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operations entail a high level of fixed costs and require an adequate volume of production and sales to achieve and maintain reasonable gross profit margins and positive net earnings 
accordingly  any significant decline in demand for the company s products or reduction in the company s average selling prices  or any material delay in customer orders would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  when net sales declined to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  the company s earnings before income taxes fell to a loss of million including million in non recurring charges incurred in the third quarter of fiscal for fiscal from earnings before income taxes of million in fiscal due  in part  to the factors described above 
in addition  the company s future results depend in large part on growth in the markets for the company s products 
the growth in each of these markets may depend on  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  or conditions which relate specifically to the markets in which the company competes  changes in regulatory conditions  legislation  export rules or conditions  interest rates and fluctuations in the business cycle for any particular market segment 
uncertainty of timing of product sales  limited backlog 
a substantial portion of the company s quarterly net sales is often dependent upon orders received and shipped during that quarter  of which  a significant portion may be received during the last month or even the last few days of that quarter 
the semiconductor industry has recently experienced a change towards significantly shorter lead times resulting in an increased dependence by linfinity upon orders received and shipped during the same quarter 
the timing of the receipt and shipment of even one large order may have a significant impact on the company s net sales and results of operations for such quarter 
furthermore  most orders in backlog can be rescheduled or canceled without significant penalty 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the company s quarterly results even during the final days of a quarter 
however  based on orders received through the first two months of fiscal  the company expects that net sales for the first quarter of fiscal will decline as compared to net sales for the first quarter of fiscal customer concentration 
a relatively small number of customers has historically accounted for  and is expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of the company s net sales in any given fiscal period 
in fiscal  at t corporation at t  a telecom solutions customer  accounted for of the company s total net sales 
no customer accounted for or more of net sales in fiscal years and the timing and level of sales to the company s largest customers have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future 
for example  the company s sales to at t increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal but decreased to million in fiscal there can be no assurance as to the timing or level of future sales to the company s customers 
the loss of one or more of the company s significant customers or a significant reduction or delay in sales to any such customer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new product development 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changes in end user requirements 
technological advancements could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s success will depend on its ability to respond to changing technologies and customer requirements and on its ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products  in a cost effective and timely manner 
delays in new product development or delays in production startup could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
such delays have happened in the past  and there can be no assurance that such delays will not recur or that the company will successfully respond to technological changes and develop and introduce new or enhanced products  or that such new or enhanced products will achieve market acceptance 
product performance and reliability 
the company s customers establish demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
the company s products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes and techniques 
undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past and there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements of existing products will not contain undetected errors  design flaws or other failures due to the complexities of such products 
in addition to higher product service  warranty and replacement costs  such product defects may seriously harm the company s customer relationships and industry reputation  further magnifying the adverse impact of such defects 
any such product performance or reliability problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition  pricing pressure 
the company believes that competition in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries in general  and in the new and existing markets served by the company in particular  is intense and likely to increase substantially 
the company s ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on  among other things the cost effectiveness  quality  price  service and market acceptance of the company s products  its response to the entry of new competitors or the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  its ability to keep pace with changing technology and customer requirements  the timely development or acquisition of new or enhanced products  and the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors 
in the telecommunications market  telecom solutions primary competitors are datum inc and hewlett packard company 
in addition  due  in part  to the enactment of the telecommunications act of  which permits regional bell operating companies rbocs  which are among telecom solutions largest customers  to manufacture telecommunications equipment  rbocs may increasingly become significant competitors of telecom solutions 
in the semiconductor market  linfinity competes with a number of large multinational companies and smaller niche companies 
in addition  as part of its license and supply agreement with linfinity  imp  inc has the right to manufacture  market  and sell the scsi line of products through its own sales force in direct competition with linfinity 
many of the company s competitors or potential competitors are more established than the company and have greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources 
furthermore  the company expects its competitors to continually improve their design and manufacturing capabilities and to introduce new products and services with enhanced performance characteristics and or lower prices 
the company continues to experience significant pricing pressures in all of its markets and has experienced price erosion in several product lines  including ldos and pwms 
in addition  the continuing trend toward lower priced personal computers has intensified pricing pressures in certain related markets served by linfinity 
linfinity s response has been to attempt to increase the volume of units shipped and to attempt to introduce new products with higher average selling prices  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully offset the impact of this severe price erosion 
this competitive environment could result in significant price reductions or the loss of orders from current and or potential customers which  in each case  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on foundries  assembly and test services 
although linfinity uses its own semiconductor fabrication facility to manufacture bipolar wafers  it utilizes imp  inc  an independent semiconductor foundry located in san jose  california  to supply most of its bicmos wafers 
while reliance on an outside foundry may reduce capital expenditures and fixed costs  it increases certain risks significantly  including limited control of delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  production costs  and wafer supply  particularly during periods of rapidly fluctuating demand 
in the event that linfinity s outside foundry  as a result of financial or operating difficulties or otherwise  is unable or unwilling to continue supplying wafers to linfinity in the quantities and with the yields required by linfinity  there can be no assurance that linfinity will be able to identify and qualify additional manufacturing sources in a timely manner  that any such additional manufacturing sources would be able to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields or that linfinity would not experience delays in product availability  quality problems  increased costs or disruption in product development activities 
irrespective of cause  delayed or reduced wafer supply or reduced manufacturing yields could result in delayed shipments or canceled orders which  in either case  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
linfinity also increasingly relies on independent contract manufacturers in the far east to assemble and test a significant percentage of its integrated circuits and most of its electronic modules 
reliance on independent contractors can lengthen manufacturing cycle times  especially if linfinity is required  due to contractors capacity constraints  to compete against others for these contractors services 
any inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity through existing or alternative sources at favorable prices  if and as required  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary technology 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to protect trade secrets  obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
the company relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and patent registration  contractual restrictions and internal security to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that such measures will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets or other proprietary information 
the company has united states and international patents and patent applications pending covering certain technology used by its telecom solutions and linfinity operations 
however  while the company believes that its patents have value  the company relies primarily on innovation  technological expertise and marketing competence to maintain its competitive position 
the telecommunications and semiconductor industries are both characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
while the company intends to continue its efforts to obtain patents whenever possible  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued or that new or existing patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted will provide any commercial benefit to the company 
the company is also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
although the company is not currently party to any intellectual property litigation  from time to time it has received claims asserting that the company has infringed the proprietary rights of others 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future or that any such claims will not result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license for such intellectual property rights regardless of the merit of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
environmental matters 
the company s operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
while the company has not experienced any materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental regulations  there can be no assurance that changes in such regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements or restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in suspension or cessation of the company s operations  or could subject the company to significant liabilities 
although the company periodically reviews its facilities and internal operations for compliance with applicable environmental regulations  such reviews are necessarily limited in scope and frequency and  therefore  there can be no assurance that such reviews have revealed or will reveal all potential instances of noncompliance 
the liabilities arising from any noncompliance with such environmental regulations could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
governmental regulations 
federal and state regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission and the various state public utility commissions and public service commissions  regulate most of the company s domestic telecommunications customers 
although the company is generally not directly affected by such legislation  the effects of such regulation on the company s customers may  in turn  adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  the sale of the company s products may be affected by the imposition upon certain of the company s customers of common carrier tariffs and the taxation of telecommunications services 
these regulations are continuously reviewed and subject to change by the various governmental agencies 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international sales 
the company s export sales  which were primarily to the far east  western europe  canada and latin america accounted for  and of the company s net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
export sales to the far east accounted for  and of the company s net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
international sales subject the company to increased risks associated with political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
for example  the company believes that the recent economic instability being experienced by certain asian countries may continue to adversely affect export sales to the far east during the first quarter of fiscal and beyond 
in addition to the loss of direct sales to the region  the economic instability in asia could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations indirectly if  for example  the current situation in asia adversely affects the company s distributors  customers and suppliers in the asia region or elsewhere in the world  causing more widespread reductions in sales  delays in collection and supply difficulties 
international sales may be subject to certain additional risks  including but not limited to  foreign currency fluctuations  export restrictions  longer payment cycles and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tariffs 
to date  sales and purchase obligations denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant 
however  if  in the future  a higher portion of such sales and purchases are denominated in foreign currencies  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of foreign currency accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s business and operating results 
the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities or derivative arrangements but may do so in the future to the extent that such obligations become more significant 
additionally  currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the demand for the company s products in foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations in the future or require the company to modify significantly its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary technology to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
inventory risks 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million inventory provision in view of lower sales prices and sales volumes experienced by linfinity 
although the company believes that it currently has appropriate provisions for inventory that has declined in value  become obsolete or is in excess of anticipated demand  there can be no assurance that such provisions will be adequate 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if significant inventories become obsolete or are otherwise not able to be sold at favorable prices 
uncertainties regarding sales to distributors 
the percentage of the company s sales sold through distributors  particularly at linfinity  has generally increased over the past several years  although such percentage fluctuates from quarter to quarter 
sales to distributors  either contractually or by industry custom  may be subject to certain rights of return and other allowances for which the company maintains reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if actual allowances significantly exceed amounts reserved therefor 
changes to effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of earnings loss before income taxes that the company derives from its telecom solutions operation compared to its linfinity operation 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was magnified by the significant loss at linfinity which was subject to higher tax rates from its united states jurisdictions offset by the earnings at telecom solutions 
most of telecom solutions puerto rico earnings are taxed under section of the us internal revenue code which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income taxes 
this results in an overall lower effective tax rate for telecom solutions 
this exemption is subject to certain wage based limitations and expires at the end of fiscal in addition  this exemption will be subject to further limitations during fiscal years through fluctuations in stock price 
the company s stock price has been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
many factors  including any shortfall in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
year compliance risks 
the company is aware that many existing information technology it systems  such as computer systems and software products  as well as non it systems that include embedded technology  were not designed to correctly process dates after december  the company is currently assessing the impact of such year issues on its internal it and non it systems as well as on its customers  suppliers and service providers 
the company has formed a year project team to identify and address year compliance issues  including those related to the company s significant non it systems used in the company s buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure 
the year project team is continuing its testing and evaluation of the company s products and the company s it systems and has recently begun the process of compiling an inventory of all material year issues related to the company s non it systems 
the company has not identified any significant areas of non compliance with respect to its products or it systems and expects that the assessment and plans for remedial action for all of its products  it systems and non it systems will be completed by the end of fiscal the company has also initiated discussions with its significant suppliers and service providers regarding their plans to investigate and remediate their year issues 
although the company anticipates cooperation in these efforts from most of the company s significant suppliers and service providers  the company is also dependent on certain utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers that are outside the company s control 
therefore  it may be difficult for the company to obtain assurances of year readiness from such third parties 
although the company believes that its year project team will identify all of the company s material year issues in the course of its assessments  given the pervasiveness of year issues and the complex interrelationships among year issues both internal and external to the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and accurately evaluate all such issues 
the company estimates that the expenses it has incurred to date to address year issues have not been material and  although it has not completed its full assessment of its year readiness  it does not expect to incur material expenses in connection with any required remediation efforts 
as the process of compiling an inventory of non it systems proceeds and as the other efforts of the year project team continue  the company may identify situations that present material year risks and or that will require substantial time and material expense to address 
in addition  if any customers  suppliers or service providers fail to appropriately address their year issues  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  because a significant percentage of the purchase orders received from the company s customers are computer generated and electronically transmitted  a failure of one or more of the computer systems of the company s customers could have a significant adverse effect on the level and timing of orders from such customers 
similarly  if year problems experienced by any of the company s significant suppliers or service providers cause or contribute to delays or interruptions in the delivery of products or services to the company  such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  disruption in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
although the year project team has not yet determined the most likely worst case year scenarios or quantified the likely impact of such scenarios  it is clear that the occurrence of one or more of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s year project team s activities will include the development of contingency plans in the event the company has not completed all of its remediation programs in a timely manner 
in addition  the year project team will develop contingency plans in the event that any third parties who provide goods or services essential to the company s business fail to appropriately address their year issues 
the year project team expects to conclude the development of these contingency plans by the end of fiscal even if these plans are completed on time and put in place  there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to address any third party failures or that unresolved or undetected internal and external year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company operates in two different industry segments 
telecom solutions  a division of the company  designs  manufactures and markets advanced network synchronization systems and intelligent access systems for the telecommunications industry 
linfinity microelectronics inc  a subsidiary of the company  designs  manufactures and markets linear and mixed signal integrated circuits as well as systems engineered modules primarily for use in power management and communication applications in commercial  industrial  and defense and space markets 
net sales net sales decreased by million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal sales was due to lower sales in both operations 
the increase in fiscal sales was due to higher sales in both operations 
telecom solutions net sales decreased by million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was principally due to lower sales to at t corporation at t  which decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and the completion of the secure contract with sbc communications inc  where secure sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  partially offset by higher sales to international accounts  particularly italy  germany and south africa 
the company expects sales to at t to fall further in fiscal the increase in fiscal was principally due to higher sales to at t which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal linfinity s net sales decreased by million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to increased price pressure and weak demand from component manufacturers supplying the personal computer markets as well as an overall decline in the global semiconductor market 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher unit volumes of new standard commercial products and a shift in sales to higher priced products 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
telecom solutions gross profit margin was   in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the higher gross margin reflects a slightly more favorable product mix as compared to fiscal in fiscal  the higher gross margin was principally attributable to higher unit volumes and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
linfinity s gross profit margins were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal results include a one time charge for inventory provision of million and a reduction in force charge of million 
excluding the one time charges of million  the gross margin for fiscal was 
excluding the one time charges  the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal was primarily attributed to lower production volumes and sales prices 
in fiscal  gross profit margin was unchanged from fiscal  reflecting efficiencies from higher unit sales volumes fully offset by falling prices in some areas 
operating expenses research and development expense was million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
telecom solutions research and development expense was million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal results reflect continued high investments in new products and core technology  with a slight reduction due to lower earnings based incentive compensation 
during fiscal  telecom solutions new product development program was focused on wireline and wireless synchronization  network management software and core gps  antenna and clock technologies 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher expenditures for the development of new wireless synchronization products and technologies and for the initial development efforts related to network management software 
linfinity s research and development expense was million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  million of the increase was due to purchased development from imp  inc linfinity s new product development program was focused on developing its new line of assps and desktop power management products during fiscal  and selling  general and administrative expense was million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
telecom solutions selling  general and administrative expense was million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal reflects lower selling expenses associated with lower sales and lower earnings based incentive compensation 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher marketing and sales expenses associated with increased sales  expanded sales support and product promotion and higher earnings based incentive compensation 
linfinity s selling  general and administrative expense was million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was substantially due to an increase in bad debt provision and a million charge related to a reduction in force 
the increase in was substantially due to higher marketing and sales expenses associated with increased sales  expanded sales support  new product promotion and higher earnings based incentive compensation 
operating income loss operating loss was million in fiscal  a million decrease in operating income from fiscal fiscal operating income increased by to million from million in fiscal telecom solutions operating income decreased by to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of lower net sales partially offset by reductions in operating expenses 
the increase in fiscal reflects the favorable impact of higher net sales partially offset by increased operating expenses 
linfinity s operating loss was million in fiscal  a million decrease in operating income from fiscal fiscal operating income increased by to million from million in fiscal the fiscal results reflect the unfavorable effect of lower net sales  the one time charge to inventory provision  the one time charges for the reduction in force and increased operating expenses 
the increase in fiscal reflects the favorable impact of higher net sales partially offset by higher operating expenses 
interest income expense interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal reflects lower average invested cash balances offset by slightly higher interest rates 
interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal was predominantly due to interest expense at telecom solutions  associated with the capital lease on its building in san jose 
interest expense in fiscal and fiscal was associated with a note payable at linfinity that was repaid in full in september income taxes the income tax benefit was million effective tax rate of in fiscal the income tax provision was million effective tax rate of and million effective tax rate of in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal income tax benefit and effective tax rate were primarily affected by the proportion of earnings loss before income taxes between telecom solutions and linfinity 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was magnified by the significant loss at linfinity netted against the earnings at telecom solutions 
linfinity was subject to higher tax rates from its united states jurisdictions  while most of the telecom solutions puerto rico earnings are taxed under section of the us internal revenue code which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income taxes 
the fiscal and effective tax rates were lower than the federal tax rate principally due to the benefit of lower income tax rates resulting from the federal exemption of qualified puerto rico earnings 
however  this section exemption expires at the end of fiscal and is subject to certain wage based limitations 
additionally  this benefit will be further limited during fiscal to  based on certain prior year puerto rico earnings 
net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  net loss was million  or per share diluted  in fiscal compared to net earnings of million  or per share diluted  in fiscal and net earnings of million  or per share diluted  in fiscal new accounting pronouncements effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share  which requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share information 
basic earnings per share  which replaces primary earnings per share  is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share  which replaces fully diluted earnings per share  is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares from dilutive stock options  using the treasury stock method 
all prior period earnings per share data presented have been restated to conform with the provisions of this statement 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  were issued which require the company to report and display certain information related to comprehensive income and operating segments  respectively 
both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will adopt sfas and sfas starting with its fiscal year ending june  adoption of these statements will not impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued which defines derivatives  requires all derivatives be carried at fair value  and provides for hedging accounting when certain conditions are met 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  although the company has not fully assessed the implications of this new statement  the company does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased to million at june  from million at june   while the current ratio increased to to from to the increase in the current ratio resulted primarily from the repayment of a million note 
during the same period  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million from million  principally due to million used for capital expenditures  the repayment of the million note  and million used for the net repurchase of the company s common stock which more than offset million in cash provided by operating activities 
at june   the company had a capital lease obligation entered during fiscal for a facility as described in note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements see part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedule and reports on form k 
at june   the company had million of unused credit available under its bank line of credit 
the company believes that cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  funds generated from operations and funds available under its bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  short term loan repayment and capital expenditures in fiscal at june   the company had no material outstanding commitments to purchase capital equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates interest rate exposure 
the company s exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investment portfolio  which consists of corporate debt securities which are classified as available for sale and were reported at an aggregate fair value of million as of june  these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  the company does attempt to reduce such risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than nine months  placing its investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
in addition  the company believes that it currently has the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and  therefore  believes that reductions in the value of such securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially affect the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
the company s exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balance with its uk subsidiary 
although the company transacts business in various foreign countries  settlement amounts are usually based on us currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and there is no hedging activity on sterling or other currencies 
based on the intercompany balance of million at june   a hypothetical adverse change in sterling against us dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  the company does not expect that reductions in the value of such intercompany balances or of other accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of the company s investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  international demand for the company s products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of the company s customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the us  foreign and global economies which could materially adversely affect the company
