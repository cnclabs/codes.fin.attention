item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company develops and implements mobile communications solutions  including integrated voice  data and position location services  to meet the needs of its customers 
the initial application for the company s wireless enhanced services has been developed for  and is marketed and sold to  companies which operate in the long haul trucking market 
the company provides long haul trucking companies with a comprehensive package of mobile communications and management control services at low  fixed per minute rates  thereby enabling its trucking customers to effectively monitor the operations and improve the performance of their fleets 
the company is currently developing additional applications for its network to expand the range of trucking companies that utilize its services and to address the need of the automotive and other markets 
among other things  the company entered into a strategic business alliance with prince corporation  a subsidiary of johnson controls  inc and a leading supplier of automotive interior systems and components  to develop and provide an automobile safety and security service  the autolink service  to motorists in the united states and canada 
the autolink service is planned to be available on a commercial basis beginning in late through  the company derived all of its revenues from the long haul trucking market from sales and installation of mobile communication units mobile units and charges for its services 
in early  the company commenced marketing a mobile communication solution applicable to broader segments of the trucking market 
the year was one of significant achievement for the company as the installed product base increased to  mobile units 
continuing increases in the installed base  which will generate substantially greater service revenues  are critical to achieving profitable operations and  therefore  vital to the ultimate success of the company 
continuing operating losses and negative cash flow are anticipated in the near term  but the company believes that it has sufficient resources to fund its business plan for at least the next twelve months 
during and  the company s service revenues were generated from mobile communications units served by either a switching complex operated by at t the at t complex or by the company s network services center nsc 
the nsc was placed into service during the third quarter of the nsc provides enhanced call processing services that were previously provided on an exclusive basis by at t 
the amount of service revenues and related expenses recognized by the company varies significantly based upon whether a particular customer receives service through the at t complex or the nsc 
in the case of customers served through the at t complex  service charges are collected by at t 
the company receives payment from at t for the portion of these service charges recognized by the company as revenue and the remainder is retained by at t as compensation for its cost of providing services 
in the case of customers served by the nsc  the entire amount of the service charges to customers is recognized by the company as revenue and additional operating and service expenses are borne by the company 
the operating expenses associated with the nsc are reflected in the company s financial statements as general and administrative expenses customer billing  credit  and collection activities  network services center other third party and internal operating expenses and depreciation 
because of the difference in the economic relationships described above  to the extent a greater proportion of customers are served by the nsc  service margins are expected to improve  reflecting the increased revenues recognized by the company which are expected to be partially offset by additional operating and service expenses 
because the operating expenses associated with the nsc include certain fixed costs  such operating expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with the number of customers added 
as of december   the company had installed  mobile units and had orders to install an additional  mobile units 
in comparison  the company had installed  mobile units at december  the company s order backlog is based on signed contracts  which do not always specify delivery dates

billing data received in indicated that the portion of airtime usage not billable to customers was higher than previously believed by the company and used as the basis for recording accounting estimates 
an increase in cost of cellular airtime paid for by the company in relation to airtime billable to customers caused the decrease in service gross profit margin 
the company is evaluating the factors underlying the increase in cellular airtime costs to identify and analyze technical adjustments and modifications that may enable it to improve its service gross profit margin 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in these increased expenses reflect the costs associated with billing  credit and collection activities for the nsc and a general increase in expenses as a result of the growth in the number of employees from at the end of to at the end of the most significant expense increase was bad debt expense
