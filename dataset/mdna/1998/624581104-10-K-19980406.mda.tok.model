fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  revenue 
total revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in same store revenues of  as well as the net positive effect of closing lower volume stores while internally developing stores that have generated revenue results greater than the closed stores 
the increase in same store revenues was primarily a result of i the company s emphasis in the last half of fiscal to increase the depth of copies of hit titles within its store base  ii an increase in the game rental business due to the advent and consumer acceptance of the nintendo and sony playstation game platforms and iii a decrease in the number of competitive store openings  particularly in the last half of fiscal product sales increased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal  as a result of i the company s continued and increased emphasis on the sale of previously viewed rental inventory and ii an increase in the variety of other products sold in stores  such as video accessories and confectionery items 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which reflect direct store expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  increased to of total revenue for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in store operating expenses was primarily due to i strategic responses in the company s most competitive markets  which affected certain expenses  such as labor hours used and advertising costs  ii the national minimum wage increases that were implemented on september  and september   and iii increases in rent in connection with the normal renewal of leases in existing stores 
amortization of videocassette rental inventory increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from for fiscal due primarily to i a decision by the company to increase its level of expenditures on rental inventory during the fourth quarter of and the first half of in response to industry wide competitive issues  ii an increase in the depth of hit new release titles purchased during the year  which results in more tapes being substantially amortized over six months versus three years and iii a marked increase in the quantity of new game release purchases  which is due to the buildup of inventory related to the consumer acceptance of new game platforms ie  nintendo and sony playstation 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new videocassettes  confectionery items and other goods  as well as the unamortized value of previously viewed rental inventory sold in the company s stores 
cost of product sales increased with the increased revenue from product sales and increased as a percentage of revenues from product sales from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in product sales gross margins resulted primarily from i an increase in new tape sales which carry lower margins than other sales items and ii an effort by the company to market more aggressively its new tape inventory 
these factors were offset  in part  by an increase in the sale of previously viewed rental inventory  the unamortized value of which is expensed to cost of product sales and generally generates higher margins than other product categories 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from for fiscal to for fiscal excluding  in merger related expenses associated with the acquisitions of home vision and hollywood video  general and administrative expenses would have been of revenues for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the efficiencies gained from the leveraging of overhead associated with acquisition activity in and a reduction in corporate overhead over the past year 
as a result of the above  operating income was essentially flat at million in both fiscal and fiscal however  excluding the effects of the business restructuring plan  the one time  non recurring increase in amortization of videocassette rental inventory due to the change in amortization policy and the merger related expenses from the home vision and hollywood video acquisitions  operating income would have been million in fiscal fiscal year ended january  compared to the year ended december  fiscal revenue 
total revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to an increase in the number of stores in operation from at january  to at january   and the maturation of the developed store base throughout fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in same store revenues of 
the decrease in same store revenues was primarily a result of unusually dry weather during the second quarter  the negative impact of the summer olympics and the negative impact of a reduction in rental inventory purchases as a percentage of revenues during the first three quarters of fiscal versus fiscal product sales increased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal  as a result of i an increase in the availability and number of major hits eg  independence day  mission impossible and the nutty professor and other new release titles priced by the movie studios for sell through merchandising  ii the company s increased emphasis on the sale of previously viewed rental inventory and iii an increase in the variety of other products sold in stores  such as video accessories and confectionery items 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which reflect direct store expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  increased to of total revenue for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in store operating expenses was primarily due to i higher rental payments and other expenses in many of the recently acquired stores  ii higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in the company s immature  internally developed stores and iii the decrease in same store revenues for the year 
amortization of videocassette rental inventory increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from for fiscal due primarily to the change in amortization policy as of april  described in overview above 
the application of the new method of amortizing videocassette rental inventory also resulted in a one time  non recurring increase in amortization of million during fiscal had the new amortization policy been in effect prior to january   amortization of videocassette rental inventory as a percentage of revenue would have been for fiscal amortization of intangibles as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to an increase in goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition activity of the company accounted for under the purchase method of accounting during and cost of product sales includes the costs of new videocassettes  confectionery items and other goods  as well as the unamortized value of previously viewed rental inventory sold in the company s stores 
cost of product sales increased with the increased revenue from product sales and decreased as a percentage of revenues from product sales from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in product sales gross margins resulted primarily from i an increase in the sale of previously viewed rental inventory  which generally generates higher margins than other product categories and ii an increase in margins on sell through products 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from for fiscal to for fiscal excluding  in merger related expenses associated with the acquisitions of home vision and hollywood video  general and administrative expenses would have been of revenues for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to operating efficiencies attained through a larger revenue base 
as a result of the above  operating income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the effects of the business restructuring plan  the one time  non recurring increase in amortization of videocassette rental inventory due to the change in amortization policy and the merger related expenses from the home vision and hollywood video acquisitions  operating income would have been million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary capital needs have been for opening and acquiring new stores and for the purchase of videocassette inventory 
other capital needs include the refurbishment  remodeling and relocation of existing stores 
the company has funded inventory purchases  remodeling and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations  the proceeds of two public equity offerings  loans under revolving credit facilities and seller financing 
during fiscal  the company generated million in adjusted ebitda versus million for fiscal adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding non recurring charges and less the company s purchase of videocassette rental inventory 
included in the company s videocassette rental inventory purchases for fiscal and fiscal are million and million  respectively  associated with inventory purchases specifically for new store openings 
adjusted ebitda does not take into account capital expenditures  other than purchases of videocassette rental inventory  and does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is not to be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurements as a measure of operating performance and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitda may not be identical to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company believes that in addition to cash flows and net income  adjusted ebitda is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing the operating performance of the company because  together with net income and cash flows  adjusted ebitda is widely used in the videocassette specialty retailing industry to provide investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service its debt and to fund acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower net income  an increase in merchandise inventory during fiscal  a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities during the same period  as well as the fiscal restructuring charge discussed above 
these factors are offset  in part  by higher depreciation and amortization in fiscal versus fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in funds used for investing activities is primarily the result of a decrease in the total cash expended for acquired stores  rental inventory and property  furnishings and equipment during fiscal versus fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to net cash used by financing activities of million for fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of net borrowings remaining unchanged during fiscal during fiscal  the company replaced its existing million revolving credit facility with a million reducing revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility has a maturity date of june  the interest rate of the facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depends on the company s cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
the company may repay the facility at any time without penalty 
the facility has covenants that restrict borrowing based upon cash flow levels 
during  the company voluntarily reduced the commitment to million 
at january   million was outstanding under the facility and approximately million of the million commitment was available for borrowing under the facility 
the company grows its store base through internally developed and acquired stores and may require capital in excess of internally generated cash flow to achieve its desired growth 
to the extent available  future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under the facility  financing provided by sellers  alternative financing arrangements such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings or shares of the company s stock issued to sellers 
however  there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
at january   the company had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of its videocassette rental inventory 
videocassette rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under generally accepted accounting principles because it is not an asset which is reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of the company s revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is included in working capital 
consequently  the company believes that working capital is not an appropriate measure of its liquidity and it anticipates that it will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
the company believes its projected cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity with the facility  cash on hand and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund its current plan of operations for fiscal  including its anticipated new store openings 
however  to fund a resumption of the company s acquisition program  or to provide funds in the event that the company s need for funds is greater than expected  or if certain of the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated or if the company increases its growth plan  the company will need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
failure to obtain financing to fund the company s expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on the company 
other matters the company has performed an analysis of its operating systems to determine systems compatibility with the upcoming year substantially all of the company s operating systems are year compliant  and the company does not believe that there will be any material exposure related to year compatibility
