impact of year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in the same way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems for year compliance 
it is currently anticipated that all reprogramming efforts will be completed by december   allowing adequate time for testing 
a preliminary assessment has indicated that some of the company s older personal computers and ancillary software programs may not be year compatible 
the company intends to either replace or modify these computers and programs 
the cost of this replacement is not expected to be material as the shelf life of the company s personal computers is to years and as a result historically each year approximately of all personal computers are replaced or upgraded 
all personal computers purchased in are year compatible 
the company is also obtaining confirmations from the company s primary vendors that plans are being developed or are already in place to address processing of transactions in the year however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely also will be converted in a timely fashion or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
management is in the process of completing its assessment of the year compliance costs 
however  based on currently available information excluding the possible impact of vendor systems which management currently is not in a position to evaluate as noted above  management does not believe that these costs will have a material effect on the company s earnings 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on its results of operations during the last three years 
further  inflation is not expected to adversely affect the company in the future unless it increases substantially  and the company is unable to pass through the increases in its billings and collections
