item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview industry property and casualty insurers experienced higher earnings in due to the relative absence of major catastrophes 
standard poor has reported that increased capacity and increased competition are forcing property and casualty insurers to cut prices  particularly in the commercial sector 
the reinsurance market continued to experience significant consolidation in despite the reduction in the number of large reinsurance companies  the cost of reinsurance coverage has been decreasing 
this may be attributable in part to the relatively improved underwriting experience over the last two years  the expanded bermuda market and the resurgence of lloyd s of london 
litigation continues to be a major industry concern 
in alabama  and increasingly in other states  the insurance and finance industries have been targeted in litigation 
the legal environment in alabama has received national news coverage and the alabama legislature is considering tort reform 
future changes in the current environment  if any  cannot be predicted 
recent supreme court and other regulatory rulings are expected to lead to increased marketing of insurance products by banks and other financial services firms 
this may lead to increased competition  however  the company does not expect to be significantly impacted since its major products do not include traditional life and property and casualty insurance products which banks may begin to market 
accordingly  this may result in additional products and services being sold through the company s bank distribution channel 
congress has indicated that it may examine the issue of banking reform including state regulation of the insurance industry 
the company has become aware that some financial institutions have  in connection with a loan  begun to issue debt cancellation agreements  which are similar to the company s credit life and credit disability products 
various state insurance and financial institution regulators are examining these agreements to determine whether they should be regulated as insurance 
it is premature to project the ultimate legal resolution and resulting market effects this development might have 
the federal government  commercial companies and the insurance industry continue to work together toward superfund reform and dealing with the cleanup of pollution sites 
among issues pending are the determination of retroactive liability and a proposed insurer specific tax

in and  the company did not incur any significant expenses or losses associated with the remaining credit bond policies in force 
the company s reserve development  both foreign and domestic  was not significantly different from previously established reserves 
the company s loss reserve development includes losses assumed from excess casualty reinsurance pools in which the company discontinued participation effective on or prior to the business is long tail in nature and losses continue to exceed both company and industry expectations 
most of these losses result from asbestos related and environmental pollution claims 
the company s exposure is primarily through participation in excess casualty pools 
these pools typically involve high layer coverages that are applicable only after primary insurance coverage and  in many cases  reinsurance coverages have been exhausted 
the company s experience can differ significantly from that of other insurers which wrote the primary coverages directly 
the company establishes loss reserves on known claims as recommended by the various pool managers  plus additional reserves to compensate for those claims that have not yet been reported 
at the current time  it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims due to a general absence of reliable predictive data and of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures  significant unresolved legal issues including coverage issues  policy definitions and evolving theories and arguments 
additionally  the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties is complex and uncertain 
our historical experience suggests  however  that although reinsurance pool losses will continue  they should not have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition or cash flows 
losses from the company s discontinued reinsurance pools were  and million in  and  respectively 
reserve additions in have increased the survival ratio to years from in a few of the company s products such as mobilehome physical damage and homeowners are affected by seasonal changes during the year  causing the profitability in those lines and for the company to fluctuate throughout the year

in connection with the execution of the cendant merger agreement  the company paid aig a fee of million for the termination of the aig merger agreement and certain other related agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statement on page in part ii item of this report 
the company paid the fee using principally funds provided by its credit facility and internal funds 
the cendant merger agreement also requires the company  under certain circumstances  to pay cendant a fee of million plus expenses  if the merger is not consummated 
if such payments were required  the company expects to obtain such funds from available credit facilities and or operating cash flows 
cash flows from operations of million in  million in  and million in contributed to meet operating requirements  as well as anticipated debt service 
cash provided by operating activities in excess of these needs is used in investing activities 
during  the company raised million in a public offering of preferred stock 
the net proceeds of million were used primarily to support future growth and reduce debt 
excluding any significant business acquisitions  the company expects to provide all its capital needs internally in capital expenditures planned for are not expected to be significant compared to the company s overall liquidity and cash flow 
the company completed the expansion of its headquarters in the company incurred costs of approximately million in and million in the one million share stock buyback program is not expected to significantly impact the company s liquidity or cash flow in any one financial reporting period 
during  the company acquired  of its shares with a cost of million 
while the impact  if any  from the resolution of pending litigation cannot presently be identified  the company does not expect any unfavorable outcome to have a material effect on liquidity or financial condition 
in  the company executed a million financing program with a group of banks  which features a bid loan and revolving line of credit facility to replace the million financing program 
in  the company registered million of medium term notes with maturities ranging from nine months to thirty years  with the securities and exchange commission 
in and  the company issued a million fixed rate note and a million floating rate note respectively 
the interest rate on the floating rate note is determined quarterly  and interest under the short term facility is determined at the time amounts are borrowed 
accordingly  interest rate changes may impact the company s interest expense 
under these arrangements  approximately million is available for short term liquidity needs as of year end 
consummation of the merger as contemplated by the cendant merger agreement will  unless consents or waivers are obtained from the group of banks under the credit facility  constitute an event of default and result in the termination of the credit facility 
this event may impact the company s liquidity if it is required to repay all outstanding loans and advances pursuant to the credit facility and the unavailability of further loans and advances under the credit facility 
the company does not commit a significant portion of its investment portfolio to equity securities  which were of total invested assets at december   consequently  liquidity is not significantly affected by changes in the equity securities markets 
the company s preferred stock portfolio is exposed to market value fluctuations which result primarily  but not exclusively  from the sensitivity of the preferred stocks to interest rate changes 
to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of this portfolio  the company has established a limited cross hedging program utilizing us treasury futures and option contracts 
open positions at december  were not significant 
the company does not concentrate in policy coverages under which policyholders may control  on a discretionary basis  access to cash benefits through policy surrender and withdrawals 
the company expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends  however  future dividends are dependent on the company s future earnings  capital requirements and financial condition 
additionally  based on the current dividend paying abilities of the insurance subsidiaries  the company does not foresee any difficulty in servicing its outstanding indebtedness or its dividend paying abilities 
payment of dividends to abig by its insurance subsidiaries is dependent on regulations dictated by statutory authorities in each state in which they are domiciled 
the national association of insurance commissioners has introduced standards which would treat dividends in excess of the lesser of of surplus or net income as extraordinary dividends requiring insurance department approval 
while some states have adopted the standards  others have not 
the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries is subject to restrictions discussed further in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of information by the company s insurance systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company is strategically positioned to complete the system upgrades and compliance testing by december  among the items included in our year strategy are centralized planning  adoption of internal audits guidelines for testing  coordination of detailed test plans and test lab for mainframe and distributed systems 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
the cost of achieving year compliance is estimated to be to million over the cost of normal software upgrades and replacements and will be incurred through calendar year regulations abig s insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they are authorized to engage in business 
such regulations vary from state to state  but generally relate to standards of solvency  pricing  licensing  investment restrictions  insurance policy forms approval  computation of reserves  assessments and financial reporting 
the naic gave final approval to the codification of statutory accounting principles sap at its march national meeting 
the main goal of the codification is to standardize prescribed statutory accounting practices 
the states will not be required to adopt the codification as the basis of statutory accounting 
instead  the sap will be the basis of practices permitted by the state of domicile and insurance departments 
accordingly  the effective date of the codification  if adapted  will be the date specified by the insurance department of each company s state of domicile  which can be as early as january  a substantial portion of the business written by the insurance subsidiaries is credit insurance 
most states have enacted laws which regulate credit insurance to a greater extent than they regulate other forms of insurance  including maximum premiums which may be charged and commissions which can be paid 
as in the case of other types of insurance  state regulators  directly and through the naic  have begun a greater focus on the regulatory  licensing and disclosure issues related to market conduct of credit insurers  including the company 
a component rating approach which allows state regulators to take into account factors other than losses in determining the reasonableness of credit insurance rates was made part of the national association of insurance commissioners naic creditor placed insurance model act that was adopted in individual states which adopt the regulation are generally expected to adapt the model regulation to their perceived needs and to apply the regulation to business written in that state 
adoption of this regulation is not expected to significantly affect the company s operations 
the investments of the insurance subsidiaries are limited as to type and amount by the insurance laws of the state of domicile 
during  the naic adopted the investments of insurers model act which provides a well capitalized insurer more discretion and flexibility in its investing practices 
additionally  investment policies are reviewed by the board of directors 
the naic has promulgated risk based capital rbc requirements 
under the rbc requirements  areas such as asset risk  insurance risk  interest risk and business risk are evaluated and compared to the company s capital and surplus to determine relative solvency margins 
the company s insurance subsidiaries all exceed their respective rbc requirements 
the catastrophe reserve subgroup of the naic is currently working on the development and implementation of a mandatory  tax deductible  pre event catastrophe reserve based on geographic exposure zones and premiums by line of business 
agreement is yet to be reached on certain factors included in the design of the reserve  such as a trigger point and a cap on the reserve 
competition the competitors of the company consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies 
because the profits  if any  of mutual companies accrue to the policyholders  such companies may have certain competitive advantages 
some competing companies  both stock and mutual  have been in business a longer time  are more widely known by reason of such factors as age and size  and have greater financial resources than abig 
however  due to the specialized nature of the markets served and products offered  most businesses of the company compete directly with a relatively small number of other insurance companies  which share the company s specialty nationwide and in regional and state markets 
profits of insurance companies are affected not only by volume of insurance sold and renewed  but by such factors as mortality and loss experience  investment income and underwriting expenses 
reserves life insurance companies are required to establish and maintain policy liabilities and claim liabilities to meet their future obligations on life policies 
the policy liabilities are amounts which will be sufficient to meet policy obligations at death  disability or maturity taking into account future premiums less expenses  interest  expected lapses and expected mortality 
the claim liabilities are amounts of future unpaid benefits on all incurred claims  whether reported to the company or not 
liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance represent estimates of unpaid claims related to known losses and of claims which have been incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are based upon past experience of ultimate claim settlements and of unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the length of time for which such costs must be estimated varies depending upon the coverage involved 
since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation  changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards  the process used in computing reserves cannot be exact  particularly for liability coverages 
the majority of the company s property and casualty insurance business is represented by property coverage in which the ultimate loss experience develops relatively quicker than that for insurers concentrated more heavily in liability coverages 
in the ordinary course of business  the company reinsures risks with other insurance companies  nonetheless  the company is contingently liable with respect to risks reinsured  should the reinsuring companies fail to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements
