item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general revenues of the marine construction services segment are largely a function of the level of oil and gas development activity in the world s major hydrocarbon producing regions 
consequently  revenues reflect the variability associated with the timing of significant development projects 
during fiscal year  u 
s 
and north sea markets remained steady while far east and middle east markets started to weaken 
economic and political instability in indonesia and political turmoil on the indian subcontinent are also expected to have an adverse effect on exploration and production spending 
revenues of the power generation systems segment are largely a function of capital spending by the electric power generation industry 
this segment has recently experienced weak and difficult markets in nearly all of its product lines 
domestic utility original equipment markets remain sluggish as growth in demand remains modest and the electric power industry transitions from a regulated to a competitive environment 
however  demand for services and replacement nuclear steam generators to the domestic utility industry continue at significant levels 
in addition  most foreign markets for industrial and utility boilers remain strong 
however  the currency crisis  which began in southeast asia in the summer of  has slowed the number of inquiries and orders from the level of the previous year 
this segment is also expected to be adversely affected by the economic and political instability in indonesia and political turmoil on the indian subcontinent 
revenues of the government operations segment are largely a function of capital spending by the u 
s 
government 
management does not expect this segment to experience any significant growth because of reductions in the defense budget over the past several years  however  management expects it to remain relatively constant since it is the sole source provider of nuclear fuel assemblies and nuclear reactor components to the u

government 
in general  all of international s business segments are capital intensive businesses that rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of their revenues 
revenues of other operations are somewhat capital intensive and the demand for its equipment and services are affected by variations in the business cycles in the customers industries and the overall economy 
other operations is also affected by legislative issues such as environmental regulations and fluctuations in u 
s 
government funding patterns 
a significant portion of international s revenues and operating results are derived from its foreign operations 
as a result  international s operations and financial results are affected by international factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international attempts to minimize its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by attempting to match foreign currency contract receipts with like foreign currency disbursements 
to the extent that it is unable to match the foreign currency receipts and disbursements related to its contracts  its practice of entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions reduces the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on operating results

as a result of these factors  the benefit from income taxes was of pretax loss in fiscal year compared to a provision from income taxes of of pretax income in fiscal year effect of inflation and changing prices international s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  using historical dollar accounting historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on its operations  international attempts to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimation of such changes  which is reflected in an original price  or through price escalation clauses in its contracts 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  international s cash and cash equivalents increased  to  and total debt decreased  to  primarily due to a reduction in short term borrowings of  and repayment of  in long term debt 
during this period  international provided cash of  from operating activities  and received cash proceeds of  from asset disposals including i  from the termination of the heeremac joint venture  ii  from the sale of its interest in sakhalin energy investment company  ltd  and iii  from the sale of universal fabricators incorporated  and  from the issuance of stock upon exercise of stock options 
international used cash of  for net purchases of investments   for additions to property  plant and equipment   for the acquisition of preferred and common stock   for acquisitions  and  for dividends on mcdermott international s common and preferred stock 
on december   jrm and heerema terminated the heeremac joint venture 
pursuant to the termination  heerema acquired and assumed jrm s interest in the joint venture in exchange for cash of  and title to several pieces of equipment  including two launch barges and the derrick barge  a  ton lift capacity  semi submersible derrick barge 
the consideration received included a  distribution of earnings of the heeremac joint venture and payment of principal and interest under a promissory note previously due to jrm approximately 
as a result of the termination  a gain on asset disposal of  and a distribution of earnings of  were recorded 
jrm invested the cash proceeds it received in debt securities 
pursuant to agreements with the majority of its principal insurers  international negotiates and settles products liability asbestos claims from non employees and bills these amounts to the appropriate insurers 
as a result of collection delays inherent in the process  and the effect of agreed payment schedules with specific insurers  reimbursement is usually delayed for three months or more 
the average amount of these claims historical average of approximately  per claim over the last three years has continued to rise 
claims paid in fiscal year were  of which  has been recovered or is due from insurers 
at march   receivables of  were due from insurers for reimbursement of settled claims  including  classified as long term receivables 
estimated liabilities for pending and future non employee products liability asbestos claims are derived from international s claims history and constitute management s best estimate of such future costs 
settlement of the liability is expected to occur over approximately the next years 
estimated insurance recoveries are based upon an analysis of insurers providing coverage of the estimated liabilities 
inherent in the estimate of such liabilities and recoveries are expected trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors  including recoverability from insurers  which may vary significantly as claims are filed and settled 
accordingly  the ultimate loss may differ materially from amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements 
the collection delays and the amount of claims paid for which insurance recovery is not probable have not had a material adverse effect on international s liquidity  and management believes  based on information currently available  that they will not have a material adverse effect on liquidity in the future 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment decreased  to  in fiscal year the majority of fiscal year expenditures were to maintain  replace and upgrade existing facilities and equipment 
international has committed to make capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal at march  and  the babcock wilcox company had sold  with limited recourse  an undivided interest in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable of approximately  and  respectively  under an agreement with a us bank 
during fiscal year  the maximum sales limit available under the agreement was reduced from  to  depending on the amount of qualified accounts receivable available for the pool  the amount sold to the bank can vary but not greater than the maximum sales limit available from time to time 
the existing agreement will expire on july   however  b w s management is currently negotiating a new receivables sales agreement 
international currently accounts for these sales as secured borrowings 
at march  and  mcdermott international and its subsidiaries had available various uncommitted short term lines of credit from banks totaling  and  respectively 
borrowings against these lines of credit at march  and were  and  respectively 
in addition  the babcock wilcox company had available to it a  unsecured committed revolving credit facility the b w revolver 
there were no borrowings against this facility at march   while at march    was outstanding 
as a condition to borrowing under the b w revolver  the babcock wilcox company must meet or exceed certain financial covenant requirements 
negotiations are in progress to replace the current b w revolver with a  three year unsecured committed revolving credit and letter of credit facility the bwico revolver to be issued jointly to the babcock wilcox investment company  the babcock wilcox company and bwxt 
borrowings by the three companies against the facility cannot exceed an aggregate amount of  the remaining  will be reserved for the issuance of letters of credit 
during fiscal year  borrowings against the bwico revolver are expected to be minimal as management expects the babcock wilcox company to be able to fund itself from operating cash flow 
jrm was party to an unsecured and committed revolving credit facility the jrm revolver 
there were no borrowings outstanding at march  and under the jrm revolver 
the jrm revolver expired on june  jrm is currently negotiating a  three year unsecured committed revolving credit and letter of credit facility 
borrowings against the facility cannot exceed  the remaining  will be reserved for the issuance of letters of credit 
management does not anticipate jrm will need to borrow funds under the new facility during fiscal year the delaware company and jrm are restricted  as a result of covenants in debt instruments  in their ability to transfer funds to mcdermott international and certain of its subsidiaries through cash dividends or through unsecured loans or investments 
at march   substantially all of the net assets of the delaware company were subject to such restrictions 
jrm is restricted  as a result of covenants in its indenture relating to its  senior subordinated notes due july  from paying cash dividends on  or repurchasing or redeeming  its capital stock including the shares of common stock and series a preferred stock held by international  or in transferring funds through unsecured loans to or investments in international 
at march   jrm could pay cash dividends on  or repurchase shares of  its capital stock including shares held by international in the amount of  could pay up to an additional  of cash dividends on its series a preferred stock held by international  and could make unsecured loans to or investments in international of approximately  additionally  under such indenture  jrm is required to offer to purchase its outstanding senior subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  to the extent that it has proceeds from certain asset sales and dispositions equal to or exceeding  that it has not used to permanently reduce certain senior or other indebtedness or reinvested in its business within a specified time period  generally months  following each such asset sale or disposition 
currently  jrm has approximately  in proceeds from such asset sales and dispositions  which  if not used for repayment of debt or reinvested as described above  would be subject to this obligation commencing june at march   the delaware company was also restricted under its public debt indentures in its ability to repurchase or redeem its capital stock  subject to certain exceptions  including to satisfy the annual mandatory sinking fund obligations on its series a cumulative convertible preferred stock and series b cumulative preferred stock 
subsequent to march   the delaware company amended its public debt indentures to permit the call for redemption of its preferred stock provided that any cash outlay is funded by a capital infusion from mcdermott international 
it is management s intention to call for redemption all of the delware company s outstanding series b cumulative preferred stock in june management is also considering calling for redemption all of the delaware company s outstanding series a cumulative convertible preferred stock 
international maintains an investment portfolio of government obligations and other investments 
the fair value of short and long term investments in debt securities at march  was  at march   approximately  fair value of these obligations were pledged to secure a letter of credit in connection with a long term loan and certain reinsurance agreements 
over the past several years  international entered into certain investments in oil and gas projects in the former soviet union 
during fiscal year  international sold its last soviet union oil and gas interest  which was in the sakhalin energy investment company ltd  to other members of the consortium 
international received proceeds of  working capital decreased  from  at march  to  at march  during fiscal year  international s management expects to obtain funds to meet capital expenditure  working capital and debt maturity requirements from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  and short term borrowings 
leasing agreements for equipment  which are short term in nature  are not expected to impact international s liquidity or capital resources 
jrm s joint ventures are largely financed through their own resources  including  in some cases  stand alone borrowing arrangements 
mcdermott international s quarterly dividends are per share on its common stock and were per share on its series c cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the delaware company s quarterly dividends are per share on the series a cumulative convertible preferred stock and per share on the series b cumulative preferred stock 
mcdermott international s quarterly dividends were per share during fiscal year  per share in the last two quarters in fiscal year and per share in the first two quarters of fiscal year the delaware company s quarterly dividends were at the same rates in and at march   the ratio of long term debt to total stockholders equity was as compared with at march  during fiscal year  mcdermott international s board of directors approved a limited stock buy back program 
under the program  mcdermott international can purchase up to two million shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market or through negotiated transactions  depending on the availability of cash and market conditions 
as of march   mcdermott international had purchased  shares of its common stock at an average share price of under the program 
on april   mcdermott international called all of the outstanding shares of its series c cumulative convertible preferred stock for redemption on april  at the close of business on the redemption date  all  preferred shares then outstanding were converted into  common shares 
international has provided a valuation allowance  at march  for deferred tax assets which cannot be realized through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
management believes that remaining deferred tax assets at march  are realizable through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and  if necessary  the implementation of tax planning strategies involving the sales of appreciated assets 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets are the risk of incurring losses in the future and the possibility of declines in value of appreciated assets involved in identified tax planning strategies 
these factors have been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
management will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer systems being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
international has established a year risk management program to identify and correct problems associated with the year issue 
the scope of international s year risk management program covers computer systems  process control systems  and products liability 
based on assessments  international has determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its business systems software so that those systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
international presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
international has several hardware and operating system software environments 
the mainframe computing environment is provided by a third party 
operating system upgrades  applicable remediation and application replacement projects are in progress 
if modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of international 
international has initiated a program to determine the nature of potential exposure related to the year issue for products it has sold  to develop a communication program for customers potentially impacted  and to assess process control systems 
international does not expect this exposure to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
international will use both internal and external resources to reprogram  replace  and test the software for year modifications 
international s business units and its corporate office are anticipating having all critical systems year compliant no later than june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on their business 
the cost of the year remediation projects is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost   is attributable to the purchase of software which will be capitalized and the remaining  will be expensed as incurred 
costs to date include  capital and  expense 
the costs of the project and the dates on which international believes it will complete its year project are based on management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including continued availability of resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel  the ability to identify and correct all year impacted areas  and other similar uncertainties 
new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
international has not yet finalized its review of the impact of this statement  but it is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
