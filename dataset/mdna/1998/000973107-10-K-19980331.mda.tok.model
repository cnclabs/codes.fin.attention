the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview act manufacturing  inc provides value added electronics manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers oems in the networking  computer  telecommunications  industrial and medical equipment markets 
the company provides oems with complex printed circuit board pcb assembly primarily utilizing advanced surface mount technology smt  mechanical and molded cable and harness assembly  electro mechanical sub assembly  and total system assembly and integration 
the company targets moderate volume production runs of the complex  leading edge commercial market applications of emerging and established oems  which generally require technologically advanced and flexible manufacturing as well as a higher degree of value added services 
these applications are generally characterized by multiple configurations and high pcb densities 
as an integral part of its service to oem customers  the company provides advanced manufacturing and test engineering  flexible materials management  and comprehensive test services  as well as product repair  packaging  order fulfillment and distribution services 
the company was founded in as a contract manufacturer of cable and harness assemblies 
in  the founder of the company organized a separate corporation to serve as a contract manufacturer of pcb assemblies 
each of these companies was acquired by the current principal stockholder of the company effective january  pursuant to two option agreements  one of which was entered into in july and the other of which was entered into in june the predecessor pcb assembly company was merged with and into the company in december  at which time the company changed its name to act manufacturing  inc from november  to march   the company was treated as an s corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes 
as a result  during that period the company had not been subject to federal income taxes and had been subject to certain state income taxes at a reduced rate 
accordingly  net income for periods prior to is presented on a pro forma basis as if the company had been a c corporation for such periods 
the company expanded the geographic scope of its operations through two strategic acquisitions in june the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of electronic systems international  located in norcross  georgia 
electronic systems international provides electronics manufacturing services to oems based primarily in the southeastern united states consisting of pcb assembly  electro mechanical subassembly and total system assembly 
the company also acquired signmax limited  located in dublin  ireland 
signmax limited provides electronics manufacturing services primarily consisting of cable and harness assembly 
the operating results of the acquired businesses are included from the date of purchase in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company typically recognizes revenue upon shipment to customers 
the company generally does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from its customers  and  accordingly  works with its customers to anticipate delivery dates and future volume of orders based on customer forecasts 
the level and timing of orders placed by the company s oem customers vary due to customer attempts to manage inventory  changes in the oem s manufacturing strategy and variation in demand for customer products due to  among other things  introduction of new products  product life cycles  competitive conditions or industry or general economic conditions 
the company may source components for product assemblies based on customer forecasts 
however  the company s policy is that customers are responsible for materials and associated acquisition costs in the event of a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from the forecasted amounts 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each fiscal year indicated 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
year ended december  pro forma net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest and other expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss for the year ended december   the company experienced significant changes and events that adversely affected its results of operations 
for the third and fourth quarters of  the company experienced a decrease in net sales on both a sequential and comparable period basis 
the decline in net sales was principally due to a softness in demand from several major customers resulting in the conversion of fewer forecasted orders than anticipated as well as  in the case of the third quarter  orders and commitments anticipated to ship prior to the end of the quarter that were received too late for configuration and completion in the quarter 
the company identified a significant inventory shortfall as a result of its year end physical inventory 
as a result of the shortfall  the company recorded a charge of approximately million which was included in cost of goods sold for the shortfall was investigated by company personnel and  under the direction of the audit committee of the board of directors  by independent external accounting specialists 
the ultimate cause of the shortfall could not be finally determined  and accordingly the associated charge was reported in the fourth quarter of as a result of this shortfall  the company is reviewing its security procedures and operating and financial controls and  based upon such review  where appropriate  will implement enhanced procedures and controls 
the company expects to conduct quarterly inventories until it can assess the effectiveness of these measures 
in addition  in the company included in its accounts receivable reserve approximately million in connection with amounts due from discontinued customers and accrued an expense of  for professional fees related to the investigation of the inventory shortfall 
compared to the company s net sales increased to million in from million in this increase was attributed principally to an expansion of business from existing customers and sales to new customers in the pcb assembly markets 
the increase was also due to the effect of acquisitions made by the company during without the acquisitions  the increase in net sales would have been approximately 
as a percentage of net sales  the company s largest customers in included bay networks  emc and ascend 
as a percentage of net sales in  ascend was the largest customer with of net sales 
during  the company experienced a reduction in  and then a termination of  business with com 
sales to com were less than of net sales in compared to of company net sales in the company provides electronics manufacturing services to customers in the networking  industrial  computer  telecommunications and medical equipment markets 
percentage of market net sales networking industrial computer telecommunications medical net sales in the pcb assembly division including system integration and test operations increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in net sales in the cable and harness assembly division accounted for of net sales compared to of net sales 
gross profit decreased by million or to million in compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin decreased to in from in this change is attributable primarily to the following the million inventory shortfall  changes in product mix with shipments of lower margin products higher than anticipated  lower than anticipated shipments resulting in lower manufacturing absorption  and the incurrence of higher than normal manufacturing efficiency variances 
these occurrences primarily affected business operating results in the second half of gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the first and second quarters of was relatively consistent with business operating results 
without the effect of the inventory shortfall charge  gross margin would have decreased to in due to the aforementioned reasons 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million or of net sales in  compared to million or of net sales in the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales for compared to reflects the charges associated with accounts receivable provisions  provision for professional fees related to the investigation of the inventory shortfall  acquisitions made in ireland and norcross  georgia  the continued investment in sales and marketing programs at the company  and the effects of lower third and fourth quarter net sales levels affecting full year comparative results 
without the effect of these provisions for accounts receivable and non recurring professional services  sg a as a percentage of net sales would have been in compared to of net sales in operating income decreased with a loss of million  or of net sales for compared with operating income of million  or of net sales for as a result of the previously discussed factors 
other expense net increased to million for compared with million for the increase in interest and other expense resulted principally from additional borrowings on the company s line of credit to support working capital requirements 
the company is reviewing the areas within its business and operations which could be adversely affected by year issues and evaluating the costs associated with modifying and testing its systems for the year in particular  the company has reviewed its internal operating hardware and software systems in the financial and manufacturing functions 
the company believes it has developed appropriate plans and programs regarding these internal systems to become year compliant 
although the company is not yet able to fully estimate its incremental cost for year issues  the costs which the company has expensed to date have not been material  and  based on its review to date  the company does not believe that internal year issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has also begun discussions regarding year compliance with its vendors and customers  and has not been informed by any vendor or customer of material year compliance problems 
however  there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s vendors or customers won t have material year compliance problems  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
compared to the company s net sales increased to million in from million in this increase was attributed principally to an expansion of business from existing customers and sales to new customers in the pcb assembly markets 
gross profit increased by million or to million in compared to million in gross margin increased to in from in this change is primarily attributed to higher utilization of facilities and equipment  reduced customer start up costs and the effects of company manufacturing cost improvement programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales in  compared to million or of net sales in this decrease as a percentage of net sales reflects the results of the continued growth in the company s business which allowed for a higher utilization of fixed costs  a greater proportion of net sales being made directly by the company  and the effect of the company s ongoing cost management efforts 
operating income increased to million or of net sales  in compared to million or of net sales in this improvement is the result of positive changes in gross profit and selling  general and administrative performance as previously discussed 
other expense net increased to million in compared to  in this increase is primarily attributed to interest expense associated with the utilization of the company s line of credit to fund working capital requirements for inventory and accounts receivable as related to the growth of the business 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  operating activities used million of cash in compared with million of cash usage in use of cash in supported the company s high level of growth during cash used for property  equipment and acquisition related investing activities was million for compared with million for on a consolidated basis  the company had secured revolving credit facilities of million  limited to a certain percentage of accounts receivable and inventory 
the company had fully utilized the amount available for borrowings at december  the company had operating losses for the third and fourth quarters of as a result of such losses  the company was in default as of december  with certain financial covenants under its revolving credit facility 
the company s banks have waived compliance with such covenants as of december  however  due to the nature of the financial covenants  the company reclassified all its long term bank debt of million at december  to a current liability 
the company is currently in discussions with its banks to modify the financial covenants under its revolving credit facility 
unless and until such a modification is agreed to or additional waivers are obtained  the banks are not obligated to lend additional amounts under the revolving credit facility 
if the company is unable to revise its credit facility  or if the company is unable to comply with any revised covenants  the company believes it could obtain alternative sources of financing  restructure its debt or take other action to resolve the matter 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional waivers from the banks  restructure the terms of its revolving credit facility  restructure its debt or obtain alternative sources of financing  which failure would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  at december  the company s equipment lease line of million had million of commitments and million available for use 
the company s need for  cost of and access to funds are dependent in the long term on future operating results as well as conditions external to the company 
the company believes that its current sources of and access to future capital are adequate to support operations for the next twelve months 
newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards nos 
and  reporting comprehensive income and disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas and sfas  respectively 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of these statements in fiscal sfas provides standards for reporting items considered to be comprehensive income and uses the term other comprehensive income to refer to revenues  expenses  gain and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income 
sfas requires new standards for reporting information about operating segments 
the company believes that the provisions of sfas or sfas will not  when adopted  have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in net sales and operating results the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors such as the level and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers  customers announcement and introduction of new products or new generations of products  evolutions in the life cycles of customers products  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in cost and availability of labor and components  efficiencies achieved by the company in managing inventory and fixed assets  a shift in the company s product assembly mix which results in fluctuating margins  capacity utilization  inventory obsolescence  currency exchange rate movements  acquisitions and related charges and expenses  competition in the electronics manufacturing services market  trends in the electronics manufacturing services market  trends in the electronics industry  and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
cautionary statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information which involve risk and uncertainties 
any statements in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of the company s market and customers  the company s expectations  objectives and plans for future operations  and the company s expected liquidity and capital resources 
the following cautionary statements should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
the factors discussed in these cautionary statements  among other factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
these cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
customer and market concentration  dependence on electronics industry in  the company s three largest customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
sales to bay networks  ascend and emc were approximately   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for such period 
for  the company s four largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
sales to ascend  com  bay networks and motorola were approximately   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the company s results will depend to a significant extent on the success achieved by its oem customers in marketing their products and the company s ability to diversify its customer base in order to reduce its reliance on particular customers 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products and services from the company at current levels  if at all 
the loss of one or more major customers  a significant reduction in purchases from such customers  discontinuance by any major customer of products manufactured by the company  or developments adverse to the company s customers or their products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the company experienced a reduction in net sales from the second to the third quarters of as a result of a significant reduction in orders from its then principal customer  chipcom corporation  which was subsequently acquired by com 
also  during the company experienced a redction in  and then a termination of  business with com 
in addition  the company could be adversely affected if a major customer were unable or unwilling to pay for products and services on a timely basis or at all 
the company s customer base has historically been concentrated in a limited number of segments within the electronics industry 
net sales to customers within the networking segment accounted for over of the company s net sales in each of  and these industry segments  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to intense competition  consolidation  rapid technological changes  significant fluctuations in product demand  relatively short product life cycles  and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to such industry segments could have a negative effect on the company 
the industry segments served by the company are also subject to economic cycles and have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a recessionary period or other event leading to excess capacity or downturn affecting the electronics industry generally or one or more of the industry segments served by the company would likely result in intensified price competition  reduced gross margins and a decrease in net sales  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
variability of customer requirements  nature and extent of customer commitments on orders the level and timing of orders placed by the company s oem customers vary due to customer attempts to manage inventory  changes in the oem s manufacturing strategy and variation in demand for customer products due to  among other things  introduction of new products  product life cycles  competitive conditions or industry or general economic conditions 
the company generally does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from its customers and  accordingly  works with its customers to anticipate delivery dates and future volume of orders based on customer forecasts 
the company relies on its estimates of anticipated future volumes when making commitments regarding the levels of business that it will seek and accept  the timing of production schedules  the purchase of inventory and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
from time to time  the company will purchase certain components without a customer commitment to pay for them 
the company may source components for product assemblies based on customer forecasts 
however  the company s policy is that customers are responsible for materials and associated acquisition costs in the event of a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from the forecasted amounts 
in the event a customer is unwilling or unable or not obligated to reimburse the company for materials costs in the case of a significant variance from forecast  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  may cause customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
the variability of the level and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers may result in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
a substantial portion of net sales in a given quarter may depend on obtaining and fulfilling orders for assemblies to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which those orders are received 
further  a significant portion of net sales in a given quarter may depend on assemblies configured  completed  packaged and shipped in the final weeks of such quarter 
in addition to the variability resulting from the short term nature of its customers commitments  other factors have contributed  and may in the future contribute  to such fluctuations 
these factors include  among other things  customers announcement and introduction of new products or new generations of products  evolutions in the life cycles of customers products  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in cost and availability of labor and components  efficiencies achieved by the company in managing inventory and fixed assets  a shift in the company s product assembly mix which results in fluctuating margins  capacity utilization  inventory obsolescence  currency exchange rate movements  acquisitions and related charges and expenses  competition in the electronics manufacturing services market  trends in the electronics industry and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
an interruption in manufacturing resulting from shortages of parts or equipment  fire  earthquake or other natural disaster  equipment failure or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for that quarter 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
the company had operating losses for the third and fourth quarters of as a result of such losses  the company was in default as of december  with certain financial covenants under its revolving credit facility 
the company s banks have waived compliance with such covenants as of december   however  due to the nature of the financial covenants  the company reclassified all its long term bank debt of million at december  to a current liability 
if the company is unable to revise its credit facility or is unable to comply with the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility subsequent to december   there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional waivers from the banks  restructure the terms of its revolving credit facility  restructure its debt or obtain alternative sources of financing  which failure would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  it is possible that in some future period the company s results of operations will fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and the price of the common stock would then be materially and adversely affected 
competition the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations 
the company also faces competition from a number of electronics manufacturing services providers who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  may adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services than the company 
the company may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
the company s manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with significant resources or international operations may enter the market 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the segments of the electronics manufacturing services industry in which it operates are technology  service  manufacturing capability  quality  geographic location  price  reliability  timeliness in delivering finished products and flexibility in adapting to customers needs 
there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth the company has grown rapidly in recent years and expects to continue to expand its operations 
such growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant strain on the company s management  operations  technical  financial  systems  marketing and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth will require it to continue to invest in its operational  financial and management information systems  as well as to develop further the management skills of its managers and supervisors and to retain  motivate and effectively manage its employees 
in addition  as a result of the inventory shortfall occurring in  the company is reviewing its security procedures and operating and financial controls and  based upon such review  where appropriate will implement enhanced procedures and controls 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s services and products  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition for personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees in the future  especially engineering and sales personnel 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statements acquisitions and geographic expansion 
dependence upon key personnel and skilled employees the company s future success will be largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of john a 
pino  its president and chief executive officer  and other key executives as well as its managerial  sales and technical employees 
none of the senior management or other key employees of the company is subject to any employment contract or noncompetition agreement and the company does not maintain any key man life insurance on any of its key executives 
the loss of services of any of its executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  continued growth of the company will require that  despite significant competition  it attract  motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced managerial  sales and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company s business and operations 
expansion of facilities and manufacturing capacity the company believes its long term competitive position depends in part on its ability to increase manufacturing capacity 
the company may obtain such additional capacity through acquisitions or through expansion of its current facilities 
the company is currently expanding its hudson  massachusetts facilities by  square feet and expects to relocate its dublin  ireland operations to a  square foot facility currently under construction 
there can be no assurance that such expansions will be successfully completed on time or within the company s expected expense levels 
in addition  the company s lease for its norcross  georgia facility expires in june there can be no assurance that the lease will be renewed or that alternate space will be available on acceptable terms 
the acquisition and expansion of additional facilities from time to time will require substantial additional capital  and there can be no assurance that such capital will be available 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire sufficient capacity or successfully integrate and manage such additional facilities 
in addition  the company s expansion of its manufacturing capacity has significantly increased and will continue to significantly increase its fixed costs  and the future profitability of the company will depend on its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 
the failure to obtain sufficient capacity or to successfully integrate and manage additional manufacturing facilities could adversely impact the company s relationships with its customers  limit the company s growth opportunities and materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item properties 
acquisitions and geographic expansion in june  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of electronic systems international  located in norcross  georgia 
the acquired company provides electronics manufacturing services  primarily consisting of pcb assembly  electro mechanical subassembly and total systems assembly to customers based primarily in the southeastern united states 
also in june  the company completed the acquisition of signmax limited  located in dublin  ireland 
signmax limited provides electronics manufacturing services primarily consisting of cable and harness assembly 
the company has limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations  in integrating acquired companies into its operations  in expanding the scope of operations of acquired businesses  and in operating in the southeastern united states or internationally 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will operate the acquired businesses profitably in the future 
the company may expand into other geographical areas within the united states and internationally by acquiring additional electronics manufacturing services providers or by establishing new manufacturing operations in such areas 
the company may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than the company 
any such transactions may result in the potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and other costs and expenses  all of which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations following such a transaction 
such transactions also involve numerous business risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees from the combined company 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the key employees and businesses of acquired companies will be successfully integrated with the company  that any acquired business will contribute significantly to the company s sales or earnings  or that sales and earnings of the company will not be adversely effected by the integration process or other factors 
availability of key components the company and many of its customers rely on a single or limited number of third party suppliers for many components used in the assembly process 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements 
shortages of certain electronic components have occurred from time to time 
in addition  due to the company s utilization of just in time inventory techniques  the timely availability of many components to the company is dependent on the company s ability to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that the company is unable to timely obtain key components for the reasons cited above or otherwise  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statements risks of international operations 
technological change and process development the market for the company s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain and enhance its technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although management believes that the company s operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by the company s customers  there can be no assurance that the company s process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render the company s equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that the company determines that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment by the company 
risks of international operations the company recently acquired operations in dublin  ireland which it is currently expanding  and may in the future expand into other geographic regions 
the company also purchases a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
because of the scope of its international operations  the company is subject to numerous risks  including economic or political disruptions and instability  transportation delays and interruptions  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  employee turnover and labor unrest  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and less developed infrastructure  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in policies by the us or foreign governments resulting in  among other things  increased duties  increased regulatory requirements  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on the transfer of funds  the imposition of tariffs  or limitations on imports or exports could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could also be adversely affected if the current policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by its host countries were to be reversed 
litigation on february   the company and certain of the company s officers and directors were named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased the company s common stock between october  and february  the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants knowingly made misstatements to the investing public about the company s inventory and the accuracy of its accounting policies 
although the company denies all material allegations of this complaint and intends to vigorously defend against all claims brought against it  the ultimate outcome  including the amount of possible loss  if any  of such litigation cannot be determined at this time 
no provision for any liability that may result from this litigation has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
while the company does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations  given the preliminary stages of the litigation there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters 
significant influence of principal stockholder john a 
pino  the company s president and chief executive officer  and certain trusts for the benefit of members of his family beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
pino will be able to exert significant influence over the company through his ability to influence the election of directors and all other matters that require action by the company s stockholders 
the voting power of these stockholders under certain circumstances could have the effect of preventing or delaying a change in control of the company 
environmental compliance the company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process 
a failure by the company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
such regulations could also restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require the company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations
