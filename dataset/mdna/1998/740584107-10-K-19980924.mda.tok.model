overview premisys was founded in july and became a publicly owned corporation in april the company develops  manufactures  and markets access products for use by telecommunications carriers for delivering a wide variety of voice and data services to its business customers 
the company s products enable carriers to deliver multiple services with a single device 
the company s imacs product supports the widest range of services and up to eight t or e connections  its streamline product  which was derived from the imacs  supports the same voice services and most of the data services offered by the imacs  but has a single t connection  its slimline product supports a limited number of voice and data services and has one t connection  its q product  not yet released  is a broadband integrated access device combining tdm  atm and sonet sdh on a single platform which accommodates a wide range of voice and data services 
although the imacs accounted for nearly all of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  the company s new products provide additional options in order to offer carriers more complete solutions to provide delivery of services to their business customers 
most of the company s products are deployed in new networks  typically built by new carriers  such as clecs in the united states and new wireless service providers 
the company sells its products worldwide  primarily through large telecommunications equipment suppliers  systems integrators and distributors 
the company derived  and  respectively  of its revenues from direct sales to international customers in fiscal  and international sales through domestic suppliers and distributors are reflected in the company s domestic revenues 
the company intends to continue to expand its operations outside the united states and anticipates that direct sales to international customers will increase in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of the company s revenues 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by international telecommunications committees and telecommunications authorities in various countries 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  currency conversion risks  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
see other factors that may affect future operating results indirect channels of distribution 
results of operations revenues revenues consist primarily of gross sales of products  less discounts and sales returns and allowances 
revenues in fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
the majority of the revenue increases from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were attributable to unit growth 
the rate of revenue growth in fiscal over fiscal was significantly lower than the rates of growth of revenues in earlier years 
although the company maintained a significant level of revenue growth during the first two quarters of fiscal as compared to the first two quarters of fiscal  the company experienced a large decrease in revenues in the quarters ended march  and june  as compared to the quarters ended march  and june   respectively 
the decrease from revenues of  in the quarter ended december  to  in the quarter ended march  was due primarily to several major deployments of the company s imacs product being deferred or lost by domestic and international distribution partners 
an important contributor to the company s unit growth in fiscal has been its success with domestic clecs  most notably mci through the company s strategic relationship with adc 
sales to clecs have been realized both through distribution partners and direct sales 
the company s list prices for its products did not change significantly from fiscal through fiscal the impact of average selling price fluctuations on revenues during these comparison periods was not significant 
the average revenue to the company per entire system decreased from fiscal to fiscal and was relatively unchanged from fiscal to fiscal the company expects that its rate of revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal will be the same or greater than the growth rate experienced in fiscal however  the company s expectations regarding future revenue levels are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including limited order backlog  the level of capital expenditures by clec s and other carriers and its relationships with its strategic partners and the introduction of new products

as illustrated in the table above  the company sells a substantial majority of its products to a limited number of customers  which generally resell the company s products to public carriers and end users 
the loss of any one or more of the company s major customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
any of the telecommunications equipment suppliers that market and sell the company s products could elect to cease marketing and selling the company s products  and there can be no assurance that these telecommunications equipment suppliers will continue to place orders with the company or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new telecommunications equipment suppliers or end users 
see other factors that may affect future operating results indirect channels of distribution 
the company has a strategic relationship with paradyne  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of at t  that involves the marketing and sale of the company s products by paradyne to lucent 
see other factors that may affect future operating results relationship with paradyne 
the company also has a strategic relationship with adc that has recently involved the marketing and sale of a significant amount of the company s products to mci 
shipments to paradyne and adc have generated a substantial portion of the company s revenues to date 
the company expects that sales to paradyne will increase somewhat in fiscal and that a decrease in sales to adc in fiscal will be offset by increases to other customers such as worldcom and teleport 
paradyne and adc are not subject to any minimum purchase requirements  and there can be no assurance that paradyne or adc will continue to place orders with the company 
significant reductions in shipments to paradyne or adc or their customers could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and operating results 
gross profit fiscal change fiscal change fiscal gross profit    as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues consists of component costs  compensation costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing operations and warranty expenses 
gross profit improved from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit volumes 
the slight increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was the result of lower product costs and a further shift in customer mix toward customers who purchase the company s products at higher prices  which were partially offset by an increase in discounts and the sale of fewer modules per platform 
gross margin was relatively unchanged from fiscal to fiscal the company expects its gross margins for fiscal to decline somewhat from the realized in fiscal due primarily to changes in product mix 
however  achievement of the company s expectations is subject to a number of uncertainties  including customer mix  the mix and volume of products sold and the company s ability to realize expected revenue levels 
research and development expenses fiscal change fiscal change fiscal research and development expenses    as a percentage of revenues research and development expenses consist of personnel costs  contract development fees  consulting  testing  supplies and depreciation expenses 
all software development costs have been expensed in the period in which they were incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or  from fiscal to fiscal and  or  from fiscal to fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to additional personnel for the purpose of expanding the company s product line and  to a lesser extent  increased consulting and supply expenses 
in fiscal the company s development activities focused on the development of the slimline  streamline and q products 
see other factors that may affect future operating results rapidly evolving technology 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of the company s revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal and to in fiscal the increase in expenses as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the fact that while research and development expenses grew as planned  the company s revenues did not 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of the increased research and development activities discussed above 
the company anticipates that the amount of these expenses will increase in fiscal  but as a percentage of revenues  will decrease slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the expected decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues is subject to  among other things  the company s level of revenues 
acquired in process technology in the quarter ended march   the company executed a technology license agreement with positron 
the company licensed certain sonet and sdh based technologies for use in its future products  including the q  which was announced in june first shipments of the q are projected in the quarter ending december  however  achievement of this is subject to a number of uncertainties  including undetected errors and incompatibilities with installed products 
the licensed technology includes the right to modify and manufacture products which are based on positron s osiris mb s sonet sdh products 
the licensed technology also includes the right to use and manufacture positron proprietary application specific integrated circuits asics  and training and integration assistance on all design materials 
the company will pay positron million of license fees over three years 
positron will also be paid a royalty on the company s products utilizing the licensed technology up to a maximum of million 
thus  total payments to positron will be between million and million 
the company expensed the million of license fees in the quarter ended march   resulting in a per share earnings reduction 
payments of license fees to positron in fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively

in the quarter ended march   the company announced the execution of a technology license agreement with snt 
snt s technologies will provide the company with a non blocking switching core expandable to gbs  atm interfaces to oc and oc  mb ethernet fast ethernet interfaces  and related software 
the company will use these technologies to develop broadband atm and ip multiservice platforms 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully this technology into its products 
if the company is unsuccessful in developing the product  this technology has no alternative use 
see other factors that may affect future operating results rapidly evolving technology 
the company paid a total of million for licensing snt technologies and related software 
the company expensed these fees as a purchase of in process research and development in the quarter ended march  resulting in a per share earnings reduction 
the company also received options to license future releases of snt software for additional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal change fiscal change fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses    as a percentage of revenues selling expenses consist principally of compensation costs for sales and marketing personnel including sales commissions and bonuses  travel expenses  customer support expenses  trade show expenses and advertising expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for administration  finance and general management personnel  as well as legal and accounting fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from fiscal to fiscal and  or  from fiscal to fiscal the increases during the comparison periods were primarily the result of increased staffing  primarily for sales  and associated expenses  such as payroll taxes and sales commissions and to a lesser extent increased occupancy and travel expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of the company s revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal and was unchanged at in fiscal the increase in these expenses as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to fiscal was due to the fact that while selling  general and administrative expenses grew as planned  the company s revenues did not 
the company anticipates that the amount of these expenses will increase in fiscal  but will decrease somewhat as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the expected decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is subject to  among other things  the company s level of revenues 
interest and other income  net fiscal change fiscal change fiscal interest and other income  net    as a percentage of revenues interest and other income  net consists of interest income  interest expense and  to a much lesser extent  foreign currency gains and losses 
the increase in interest and other income  net for all comparison periods was primarily due to increased interest income from higher cash balances resulting from the positive cash flow from operating activities 
provision for income taxes fiscal change fiscal change fiscal provision for income taxes    as a percentage of income before income taxes the company s provision for income taxes represents estimated federal and state income taxes 
the company s effective rate for fiscal was which was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate due to the release of the remaining valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was which was also less than the combined federal and state statutory rate as a result of tax exempt interest income from the company s municipal securities portfolio and anticipated utilization of research and development tax credits available in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was reduced to due to increased tax exempt income from the company s municipal securities portfolio and the reversal of a portion of prior year timing differences for book versus tax purposes 
the company anticipates that its effective income tax rate will remain unchanged in fiscal net income per share fiscal change fiscal change fiscal net income    net income per share diluted shares used in computing diluted net income per share    the decrease in net income per share from fiscal to fiscal was due to the decrease in net income  which resulted principally from the slower than planned rate of growth in revenues  operating expenses increasing at a higher rate than revenues and the charge associated with the positron licensing agreement 
the company expensed the million of license fees for the positron agreement in fiscal  which reduced net income per share in fiscal by 
the increase in net income per share for fiscal was due to the increase in net income  which was a result of the rate of growth of the company s revenues being greater than the rate of growth in the company s operating expenses 
this increase in net income per share was slightly offset by a greater number of weighted average common shares and common share equivalents used to calculate net income per share 
net income for fiscal was reduced by license fees paid to snt  as discussed above 
the company expensed million of license fees for the snt agreement in fiscal  which reduced reported net income per share in fiscal by

sfas establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas requires that items to be recorded in comprehensive income  which include unrealized gains losses on marketable securities classified as available for sale and cumulative translation adjustments  be displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas is required to be adopted in the company s financial statements for the year ending june  liquidity and capital resources fiscal change fiscal change fiscal net cash provided by operating activities    year end cash  cash equivalents and short term investments    year end working capital    in fiscal  net cash of million was provided by operating activities primarily due to net income  a decrease in inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable  which were partially offset by an increases in accounts receivable 
the company purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal  primarily for computers and peripherals and machinery and equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financing activities provided million of cash in fiscal the primary sources of financing in fiscal were the tax benefits of disqualifying dispositions of exercised stock options and the issuance of common stock in connection with the company s employee benefits plan 
at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and the company had working capital of approximately million 
the company has no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facilities and capital leases 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that available funds and anticipated cash flows from operations will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
on august   the company s board of directors authorized repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to four million shares of the company s common stock over the subsequent months at market prices not to exceed per share and as the market and business conditions warrant 
by september   the company had repurchased for cash  shares at market prices ranging from to per share 
as of september   pursuant to the authorized stock repurchase program  the company sold million put warrants and purchased million call options 
the company had a maximum potential obligation related to the put warrants of million 
the put warrants and call options expire in equal amounts each on january  and september  on september   the company s board of directors board adopted a stockholder rights plan plan designated to protect the long term value of the company for its stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt

other factors that may affect future operating results as referenced in the first paragraph of item  this section consists primarily of forward looking statements but does not include asterisks for improved readability 
indirect channels of distribution 
substantially all of the sales of the company s products are through indirect channels of distribution 
thus  the company s ability to affect and judge the timing and size of individual user orders is more limited than for manufacturers selling directly to the end users of their products 
any of the strategic partners that market and sell the company s products could elect to cease marketing and selling the company s products  and there can be no assurance that these strategic partners will continue to place orders with the company or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new strategic partners or end users 
see relationship with paradyne 
strategic partners could develop products that could be sold for selected applications for which the company s products are currently provided  which could reduce the level of demand from these telecommunications equipment suppliers for the company s products 
see competition 
in addition  the company s revenues for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments for a single carrier s equipment deployment project 
for example  in the quarters ended september and december   march  and june   shipments of the company s products to a clec  mci  through adc  one of the company s strategic distribution partners  represented more than of the company s total revenues for such quarters 
revenues derived from particular carrier projects are often difficult to forecast due to a relatively long sales cycle and delays in the timing of such projects 
such delays occurred in the quarter ended march   and materially adversely affected the company s business and operating results for that quarter 
such delays may occur in the future and would have a similar impact if they did occur 
delays can be caused by late deliveries by other vendors  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the equipment supports or in the capital expenditures of the end user customer  consolidation among carriers and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new tariffs 
see slowdown in telecommunications carriers capital expenditures and mergers of the company s customers 
revenues can also be affected by delays in initial shipments of new products and new software releases developed by the company 
see rapidly evolving technology 
in fiscal  a delay of the development and release of a new feature resulted in a loss of a large  forecasted shipment 
in developing countries  delays and reductions in the planned deployment of the company s products can also be caused by sudden declines in the local economy or capital availability and by new import controls 
suppliers of the company s products have in the past and may in the future build significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such suppliers to sell from their inventory could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results in the periods in which the inventory is utilized 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
while such delays have not to date had a material adverse effect on the company s business or operating results  there can be no assurance that any future delays would not have such an adverse effect 
slowdown in telecommunications carriers capital expenditures 
currently  the end user customers for the company s products are primarily clecs and interexchange carriers ixcs 
these carriers have been expanding their local networks at a rapid pace in the past two years to provide services to small and medium sized businesses that have historically been served inadequately by ilecs 
based on industry information  it now appears likely that the pace of capital expenditure growth by the clecs and ixcs will slow significantly 
the company believes that there are a number of reasons for this potential slowdown 
the largest us clecs and the ixcs which have been entering local markets have already built out major portions of their planned local networks using the billions in capital raised in the past two years 
the company believes that the smaller us clec s may have difficulty continuing to raise capital in the chaotic financial markets that may persist over the next year 
capital spending by carriers serving businesses in the japan  southeast asia  eastern europe and latin america markets are also being negatively impacted by the continuing financial crisis in japan and asia and looming problems in the economies of the other markets 
besides reducing the rate of growth of the markets into which the company sells  the company believes that this near global slowdown in capital spending increases the intensity of price competition for these markets 
while the company has recently introduced its streamline and slimline products which are more price competitive than the imacs platform  which has historically produced most of its revenues  these new products must compete with an increasing number of low priced iads 
as a result of the slowdown in telecommunications carriers capital expenditures and related increase in price competition  the company may find it more difficult to achieve expected levels of revenues and profitability 
mergers of the company s customers 
a number the largest clecs which use the company s products have announced plans to merge with larger carriers over the next several quarters 
mci has announced an intention to merge with worldcom  teleport has announced an intention to merge with at t  and gte has announced an intention to merge with bell atlantic 
the company believes that part of the impetus for each of these mergers is to increase the combined carrier s ability to compete for local access markets 
in the long term  the company believes that this should cause capital spending on local access  in which the company s products serve a vital function  to grow significantly 
however  over the next several quarters  as these mergers are consummated  it is likely that capital expenditures will be temporarily deferred as the newly combined companies evaluate inventories of undeployed equipment  potential overlaps in network deployment plans  strategies for on net versus off net deployments  and assignment of responsibilities for deployments in targeted local markets 
this risk of a deferral in expenditures on local access  including expenditures for the company s products  has already materialized in the case of mci 
not only may this risk be realized repeatedly as the teleport and gte mergers are completed in up coming quarters  but the slowdown in expenditures may persist for multiple quarters following the mergers 
in addition  the increased buying power wielded by these merged carriers and by merged equipment suppliers  such as alcatel and dsc  is likely to place added competitive price pressure on equipment manufacturers such as premisys 
quarterly fluctuations 
the company s operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis due to factors such as the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company  its major customers and its competitors  delays in equipment deployment  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of revenues  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development expense associated with new product introductions  component shortages see dependence on certain suppliers  and general economic conditions 
the company s planned product shipments for a single carrier s equipment deployment project can be a significant portion of a quarter s revenues  and delays in the timing of such a project which have occurred in the past  including the quarter ended march  could and have had a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially adversely affect the company s business and operating results for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future revenues and in the short term are fixed to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected future revenue shortfall 
in the quarter ended march   the company experienced such an unforecasted revenue shortfall and was not able to compensate for it through expense reduction  which resulted in a net loss 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company s operating results may also be affected by seasonal trends 
such trends may include lower revenues in the summer months during the company s first fiscal quarter when many businesses experience lower sales  and in the company s third fiscal quarter  as compared to its second fiscal quarter  as a result of strong calendar year end purchasing patterns from certain of the company s strategic customers 
competition 
the market for telecommunications products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
the company s principal competition to date has been from major telecommunications equipment suppliers  such as newbridge networks corporation and tellabs  inc  which offer a broad line of products including access devices for business applications 
the company expects substantial additional competition from existing competitors as they develop products to compete with the functionality and flexibility of the company s products 
as premisys begins shipping its slimline and streamline products  it expects to face additional competition from channel bank and csu dsu vendors as well as with new startups focusing on the access equipment market 
see relationship with paradyne 
the q product will likely compete with broadband access products offered or announced by a number of vendors 
certain of the telecommunications equipment suppliers that market and distribute the company s products may in the future develop products that could be sold for selected applications for which the company s products are currently provided 
successful  timely development or acquisition of such products could reduce the level of demand from these telecommunications equipment suppliers for the company s products 
in addition  certain of the telecommunications equipment suppliers which market the company s products have recently either acquired or expressed an interest in acquiring companies which have products or technologies that may be adapted to compete with the company s products in the future 
limited order backlog 
the company typically operates with limited order backlog  and a majority of its revenues in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
also  the company has from time to time  including the four quarters of fiscal  recognized a majority of its revenues from sales booked and shipped in the last month of a quarter 
due to the delivery requirements of its customers  the company expects to continue to experience limited order backlog 
the company s manufacturing procedures are designed to assure rapid response to customer demand  but may  in some circumstances  create risk of excess or inadequate inventory  which may have an adverse affect on the company s business and operating results 
the company s agreements with its customers typically allow customers to cancel orders or delay scheduled shipments without penalty until a relatively short period of time before planned shipment 
the company has experienced cancellation of orders from time to time  and expects to receive order cancellations from time to time in the future  which could adversely affect the company s revenues for a quarter or series of quarters 
because a substantial portion of customer orders are filled within the fiscal quarter of receipt  and because of the ability of customers to revise or cancel orders and change delivery schedules without significant penalty  the company believes that its backlog as of any given date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period 
rapidly evolving technology 
the telecommunications equipment market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions  which include cell and packet technologies and new digital subscriber line technologies xdsl 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
for example  the company has licensed certain technology from positron for inclusion in the company s q products  which were announced in june and are expected to begin shipping in the quarter ending december  also  in the quarter ended march   the company licensed cell and packet technologies from snt 
the company intends to ship products based upon the snt technology in calendar however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate the snt or positron technology into new products within such time frames  or at all 
in addition  failure to achieve market acceptance of the recently introduced slimline and streamline products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
in the past  certain of the company s newly introduced products have contained undetected errors and incompatibilities with installed products  which has resulted in losses and delays in market acceptance of such products 
as the functionality and complexity of the company s products continue to grow  the company has experienced and may in the future experience an increased incidence of such errors or failures as well as delays in introducing its products 
relationship with paradyne 
the company has a strategic relationship with paradyne  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of at t  that involves the joint development  marketing and sale of the company s imacs product by paradyne 
the company s agreement with paradyne provides paradyne exclusive distribution rights with respect to the products covered by the agreement to at t entities  as defined under the agreement 
at the time that the company entered into its oem agreement with paradyne  paradyne was a owned subsidiary of at t 
in  at t separated into three publicly held stand alone businesses  one of which lucent would focus on the communications equipment market 
in june  lucent concluded a stock purchase agreement for the sale of paradyne to the texas pacific group 
in the quarter ended march   paradyne announced new products which are extensions of its existing line of csu dsu products 
premisys believes that the higher capacity models of paradyne s x series offer features that are similar to those of the company s imacs and streamline products 
see competition and rapidly evolving technology 
in the quarter ended december   the company entered into an oem agreement with lucent for the purchase of the slimline and streamline products directly from premisys 
although sales to paradyne declined from fiscal to fiscal  shipments to paradyne continued to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues in fiscal neither paradyne nor lucent are subject to any minimum purchase requirements  and there can be no assurance that they will continue to place orders with the company 
significant reductions in shipments to paradyne could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
industry standards and regulatory matters 
the market for the company s products is also characterized by the need to meet a significant number of voice and data communications regulations and standards  including those defined by the federal communications commission  underwriters laboratories  bell communications research bellcore and  internationally  various countries and international standards committees 
regulations can be changed by new legislation  as occurred with the enactment of the telecommunications reform act of  these changes can impact service offerings and competitiveness in the communications marketplace  and thus could have an effect on the timing and size of the industry s investment in access equipment 
new standards are evolving as new technologies  such as atm and xdsl  are deployed 
as existing and new standards evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
it is also important that the company s products be easily integrated with carriers network management systems 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
in addition  government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success to date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of its senior officers and other key employees 
certain of the company s senior officers  including its chief executive officer  senior vice president  sales and marketing and its senior vice president  finance and administration  and chief financial officer  have only recently assumed their current positions 
the loss of the services of any one of the company s senior officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company s success also depends to a significant extent on its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  managerial and sales and marketing personnel  the competition for whom is intense 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will prove sufficient to deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or independent third party development of similar technologies 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of such third parties  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
dependence on certain suppliers 
certain components used in the company s products are currently available from only one supplier 
in addition  the company relies on contract manufacturers to produce its printed circuit board assemblies 
use of contract manufacturers can expose premisys to supply interruptions due to production  quality or financial problems of its contractors 
shortages or delays in the delivery of the components used in the company s products which have occurred in the past or extended delays in deliveries of printed circuit board assemblies could result in delays in the shipment of the company s products and or increase component costs 
failure of the company to order sufficient quantities of any required component in advance could prevent the company from increasing production of products in response to customer orders in excess of amounts projected by the company 
although the company typically maintains some reserve inventory of components and printed circuit board assemblies  this inventory would not cover a significant delay in the delivery of such items 
year risks 
the company has a formal year conformance project in place that focuses on three key readiness areas internal infrastructure readiness  addressing internal information systems and non information technology systems  supplier readiness  addressing the preparedness of our supplier base  and product readiness  addressing the company s product functionality  which includes customer support of the installed base of the company s product 
for each readiness area  a task force is systematically performing a company wide risk assessment  conducting testing and remediation  and communicating with employees  suppliers  customers and other third party business partners to raise awareness of the year problem 
following are overviews of each readiness area and the company s progress thereon for becoming ready for the year internal infrastructure readiness an assessment of internal and computer software and hardware is being completed with the assistance of a third party 
the company is in the process of migrating to an upgraded version of its enterprise wide accounting and manufacturing system  which will be year compliant 
for other systems  the company has identified all non compliant systems  established a project for prioritized system compliance  and is in the process of executing under such compliance project 
with respect to the company s enterprise wide accounting and manufacturing system  compliance is scheduled for completion by november other systems are scheduled to be compliant no later than may in addition to applications and information technology hardware  the company is testing and developing remediation plans for embedded systems  facilities and other operations 
supplier readiness this program is focused on minimizing the risk associated with suppliers in two areas a supplier s business capability to continue providing products and services  and a supplier s products compliance with year suppliers are being identified and contacted based on their relative risk in these two areas 
the company has received responses from a significant number of its preferred suppliers 
most of the respondents are in the process of developing remediation plans 
supplier issues that potentially affect the company s products are targeted to be resolved by july product readiness the company has completed a comprehensive program which focused on identifying and resolving year issues existing in the company s products 
the program encompassed a number of key efforts including testing  evaluation  engineering and manufacturing implementation 
in addition  the program focused on customer support of the installed base  including coordination of retrofit activity and testing existing customer electronic transaction capability 
based on these efforts  the company believes that its products are year compliant 
general and risk factors the company s year project is currently in the assessment phase and  with respect to certain information systems and products  in the remediation phase 
the company believes that its greatest potential risks are associated with its information systems and systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure 
the company is at the beginning stage of assessment for its operations and infrastructure  and cannot predict whether significant problems will be identified 
the company has not yet determined the extent of contingency planning that may be required 
based on the status of the assessment made and remediation plans developed to date  the company is not in a position to state the total cost of remediation of all year issues  however  the company believes such costs will not exceed  however  the company has not yet completed its assessments  developed remediation for all problems  developed any contingency plans  or completely implemented or tested any of its remediation plans 
as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation or contingency plans  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations 
in many cases  the company is relying on assurances from suppliers that new and upgraded information systems and other products will be year compliant 
the company plans to test such third party products  but cannot be sure that its tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed by the supplier in a timely and satisfactory way 
because the company uses a variety of information systems and has additional systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  it cannot be sure that all of its systems will work together in a year compliant fashion 
furthermore  the company cannot be sure that it will not suffer business interruptions  either because of its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible for them to fulfill their commitments to the company 
if the company fails to satisfactory resolve year issues related to its products in a timely manner  it could be exposed to liability to third parties 
stock price fluctuations 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors  such as changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  can materially affect the company s stock price for one quarter or a series of quarters 
further  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that the trading price of the company s common stock will remain at or near its current level 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of business  is subject to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuations in the market value of its fixed income securities available for sale  and changes in interest rates 
to date  the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has been minimized through the denomination of its foreign sales  and hence its accounts receivable  in us dollars as well as the use of letters of credit when warranted 
the company funds its international operations from us dollar bank accounts on an as needed basis and  accordingly  does not keep significant amounts of funds in foreign currencies 
presently  the company does not hedge foreign currency exposures for its non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  asia  canada and latin america as such amounts have not been material in relation to the company s domestic operating expenses 
until fiscal  the company purchased a substantial amount of its modules from one foreign supplier 
today  substantially all of these modules are sourced in the united states 
the company also maintains a portfolio of marketable  fixed income securities  available for sale  of various issuers  types and maturities 
substantially all of the portfolio consists of municipal securities 
the company limits its exposure to interest and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for its fixed income portfolio 
the maximum allowable maturity for any one investment is years and the maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards and limits on exposure to one issue  issuer and type of instrument
