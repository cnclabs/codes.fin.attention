overview general magic  inc the company develops and markets integrated voice and data applications 
the company is currently developing an advanced network service to meet the communication and information management requirements of today s mobile professionals 
the advanced network service will allow subscribers to access and respond to information important to their success  either through a highly developed voice user interface or a leading web browser 
among other things  the service is expected to i manage the subscriber s inbound and outbound calls  ii collect and consolidate the subscriber s email  and notify the subscriber upon receipt of priority messages  iii maintain the subscriber s calendar  address book and task list  iv collect and forward stock quotes  news and selected public information based on subscriber preferences  and v retrieve press releases and other news and information concerning thousands of publicly traded companies 
the company is also developing and marketing handheld communication devices based on its magic cap platform technology 
the first of these devices  the datarover  was commercially released in february  and is intended to meet the data access and communication needs of mobile workers in the health care  utilities and transportation industries 
the company is at an early stage of development in its new business strategy and is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  establish technical feasibility and complete development of its advanced network service  enter into strategic development and distribution arrangements  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the company s decision to focus its efforts as a provider of an advanced network service is predicated on the assumption that in the future  the number of users of the company s network service will be large enough to permit the company to operate profitably 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumption will be correct or that the company will be able to successfully compete as a network service provider 
any failure to achieve these goals could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
results of operations the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   and compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in total revenue total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s total revenue consists of license fees for magic cap  telescript and software modem technologies and other revenue 
licensing revenue primarily represents revenue from nonrefundable license fees for the company s technologies 
other revenue represents fees earned under customer specific engineering  maintenance and support services contracts 
fees from customer specific engineering projects were recognized under the percentage of completion method based on achievement and acceptance of milestones or performance of services  as applicable 
support and maintenance fees were recognized over the period the service or maintenance was provided 
the decrease in total revenue from to was due to a decline in support services provided by the company to licensees of its magic cap technology 
the decrease in total revenue from to was primarily due to reduced licensing revenue resulting from a lack of demand for products incorporating the company s magic cap and telescript technologies 
the company anticipates an increase in total revenue in compared to due to the anticipated release of its advanced network service and the release of the datarover device 
there can be no assurance that the advanced network service will be released on time or at all  or that either the advanced network service or the datarover device will achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that either the advanced network service or the datarover device does not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
cost of other revenue cost of other revenue  which consists primarily of personnel and equipment costs  was  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was due to a decline in support services in the increase from to was due to increased costs related to customer specific services in cost of revenue is expected to increase in compared to as a result of the anticipated release of the company s advanced network service and the release of the datarover device 
research and development research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily the result of savings attributed to reductions in headcount and discretionary spending  partially offset by million in one time charges for technology license fees related to the development of the company s advanced network service 
the increase from to was primarily due to research and development expenses incurred by the company in connection with the redirection of its product offerings for its magic cap and telescript technologies to the personal computing and internet markets 
to date  the company has expensed all software development costs as incurred 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase in as compared to in connection the anticipated release of its advanced network service and the release of the datarover device  as well as the continued development of its products and services 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the implementation of the company s restructuring plan  which resulted among other things in a decrease in headcount and reduced sales and marketing programs 
in addition  the company closed its sales offices in france and japan during the increase from to was primarily due to additional marketing programs  expansion of the company s domestic and international sales effort  and increased staffing and facility costs to support headcount growth prior to the company s implementation of its restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in compared to as a result of the anticipated release of its advanced network service and the release of the datarover device  as well as the continued development of markets for its products and services 
write off of acquired technology and in process research and development in  the company recognized a one time charge of million 
included in this charge was a million writeoff of the purchase cost of acquired software technology previously capitalized and  of in process research and development 
restructuring in the fourth quarter of  the company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and achieve long term profitability in the company s operations 
adoption of the restructuring plan resulted in a charge of million in from the inception of the plan through  the company incurred cash expenditures of million relating to involuntary employee terminations  canceled and vacated leases  and contract settlement costs 
in addition  the company incurred noncash expenditures of  related to the disposal of office and computer equipment 
no other similar charge was taken in  nor does the company anticipate taking any such charge in total other income  net total other income  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
total other income  net consisted primarily of interest income and expense 
the decreases from to  and from to were primarily due to the company s declining cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
in addition  in the company began accruing for interest due under certain license agreements 
future interest income is likely to decrease as cash equivalents and short term investments are consumed by the company s normal operating requirements  unless the company generates additional cash 
income taxes income taxes were   and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes were related to foreign withholding taxes on revenue generated from the company s japan based customers 
as of december   the company had cumulative federal net operating losses of million  which can be used to offset future income subject to federal income taxes 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will expire from through the company has cumulative california net operating losses of million  which can be used to offset future income subject to california income taxes 
the california tax loss carryforwards will expire from through as of december   foreign tax credits of million were available to reduce future federal income taxes 
foreign tax credit carryforwards expire from through as of december   unused research and development tax credits of million and million were available to reduce future federal and california income taxes  respectively 
federal credit carryforwards will expire from through  california credits will carry forward indefinitely 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances that totaled million as of december   down million from million as of december  the decrease was primarily due to operating losses and capital expenditures  as well as payment of obligations accrued by  including costs associated with commitments to magic cap licensees and restructuring costs 
in connection with the company s initial strategy to promote its magic cap and telescript technologies  the company entered into various contractual arrangements with certain stockholders 
significantly all of the company s total revenue from may  inception through december   was generated from such stockholders  or their affiliates 
five companies  which became stockholders of the company prior to  entered into license agreements to pay royalties for the company s magic cap technology 
the agreements each provided for the payment of up to million in prepaid royalties by each licensee in the event that the company met certain technology development milestones 
these prepayments were to be offset at a rate of for every dollar of royalties payable by the licensees upon shipments of products incorporating the company s technology 
if the prepayments were not fully recouped by the fifth anniversary of the license agreements november   the licensees were each entitled to demand repayment of the unrecouped amount plus interest 
in september  the company entered into an agreement with one of these five magic cap licensees which  among other things  permitted the licensee to recoup of any royalties owed to the company under a separate software modem license agreement against the magic cap royalty prepayment  amended the magic cap license agreement to provide for recoupment of any royalties due thereunder  extended the date for refund of unrecouped prepaid royalties to november   and provided that no interest will be due upon any refund 
as a result of this new agreement  the unrecouped prepaid royalty of million remained in noncurrent deferred revenue as of december  as of december   three of the remaining four companies had demanded and received repayment of the unrecouped prepaid royalties  excluding a portion of interest due 
the obligations outstanding under the agreements with these five companies as of december   totaled million and was classified in current liabilities 
additionally  in and  the company entered into magic cap technology license agreements with three other stockholders 
these license agreements each provided for the payment of a million up front  nonrefundable  nonrecoupable license fee 
the agreements also provided for the payment of up to million in prepaid royalties  payable in installments upon the company s achievement of certain technology milestones 
failure to deliver the technology milestones entitled each licensee to terminate its agreement and obtain a refund of unrecouped prepaid royalties in two equal annual installments of principal  plus interest from the date of termination  payable commencing one year following termination of the agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  each of the three licensees demanded delivery of the final milestone due under the license agreements 
the company delivered the final milestone in january in june  the company reached an agreement to resolve the claims of  and terminate the license agreement with  one of these three licensees 
in consideration therefor  the company agreed to refund the unrecouped prepaid royalties of million previously classified as noncurrent deferred revenue  waive any further payments otherwise due under the agreement including  classified in accounts receivable and noncurrent deferred revenue  and grant a royalty free license to certain software modem technology 
the million refund is secured by a license in certain of the company s intellectual property  is non interest bearing and is payable in august in september  the company reached agreement with a second of the three licensees providing for acceptance of the final milestone  subject to certain conditions which were satisfied by the company later that month 
pursuant to this agreement  the company waived payment of the final  installment of the prepaid royalties and recognized million in licensing revenue previously classified as noncurrent deferred revenue 
in october  the company reached agreement with the third licensee  also providing for acceptance of the final milestone 
pursuant to this agreement  the company waived payment of the final  installment of the prepaid royalties and agreed to refund prepaid royalties not recouped by january   plus any accrued interest  on or before december  as of december   the company had million classified in other long term liabilities and million classified in noncurrent deferred revenue related to its remaining obligations under agreements with these three licensees 
the following table is a summary of obligations for all of the magic cap licensees in thousands noncurrent other accrued deferred long term liabilities revenue liabilities total as of december     as of december      there can be no assurance that any of the company s licensees will continue to develop products that incorporate the company s magic cap technology 
therefore  it is uncertain when prepaid royalties currently classified as noncurrent deferred revenue will be recognized as licensing revenue or if they will be fully recouped 
during  the company entered into an oem agreement with oki electric industry co  ltd 
oki electric for the manufacture of handheld communication devices 
in connection therewith  the company obtained an irrevocable letter of credit with a term of one year to collateralize the company s obligation to oki electric for the purchase of these devices 
the company has placed on deposit million as security with the financial institution issuing the letter of credit 
this commitment is denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  is at risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
as of december   the company s purchase commitment was million due to favorable changes in the exchange rate 
management continually assesses the currency risk associated with this commitment  and may enter into agreements in the future to mitigate this risk 
in december  the company entered into a million term loan with a financial institution 
the loan bears interest at above the financial institution s prime rate as of december   and has a term of forty months with interest only due in the first four months and principal and interest due monthly thereafter 
this loan is subject to certain financial covenants measured on a monthly basis  and is secured by all of the assets of the company  including intellectual property 
as of december   the current and noncurrent portions of debt due under this loan were  and million  respectively 
on february   the company entered into an agreement with microsoft corporation 
the terms of the agreement include an equity investment of approximately in the company  and a license of certain company technology in return for a total of million in cash 
on march   the company entered into a private financing transaction that provided million in cash to the company from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
as part of the transaction  the company also issued five year warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock at a premium to the common stock price as of the date of the private financing transaction 
the company has the option to secure an additional million in financing on similar terms based on certain conditions  including share price  average trading volume and total equity 
on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common and preferred stock of netphonic communications  inc for million  comprised of  cash and  shares of newly issued shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method 
the company expects that a significant component of the purchase price will be attributable to in process research and development 
based on a preliminary study  the company does not expect that its costs for the conversion of computer information systems to enable proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond will be material 
the company continues to evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action 
the company does not expect any amounts that it may be required to expense over the next two years will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial position or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
see risk factors year compliance 
the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances of million as of december   together with the additional financing received in the first quarter of  will be adequate to fund the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company will continue to evaluate additional sources of capital 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the market acceptance and competitive position of its new products and services  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch and market such products and services and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  the extent to which the company invests in new technology and management and staff infrastructure to support its business  and the response of competitors to the company s products and services 
to the extent that the company needs additional public and private financing  no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long term capital requirements  or if the objectives of the company relative to the release and market acceptance of its advanced network service are not achieved  the company may be required to significantly limit its operations which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that the company raises additional equity financing  further dilution to investors in the company will result 
as part of its business strategy  the company assesses opportunities to enter into joint ventures  to acquire or sell businesses  products or technologies and to engage in other like transactions 
the company has made no significant commitment or agreement with respect to any such transactions at this time 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business before purchasing shares of the company s stock 
change in strategy the company is at an early stage of development in its new business strategy and is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  establish technical feasibility and complete development of its advanced network service  enter into strategic development and distribution arrangements  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the company s decision to become a provider of an advanced network service is predicated on the assumption that in the future  the number of subscribers to the service will be large enough to permit the company to operate profitably 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumption will be correct or that the company will be able to successfully compete as a network service provider 
if the company s assumption is not accurate  or if the company is unable to compete as a network service provider  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
minimal revenues  history of and anticipation of losses the company has generated minimal revenues  has incurred significant losses and has substantial negative cash flow 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million  with net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  a large percentage of the total revenue earned by the company to date has been attributable to up front license fees and customer support fees  as opposed to recurring royalty revenue 
as a consequence of the company s recent change in business strategy  the company expects that a significant portion of future revenues will be derived from direct sales of its products and services and not from license fees or royalties 
the company s datarover device was commercially released in february  and its advanced network service is expected to be released by the middle of the year 
however  the company expects to incur significant losses through there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain significant revenues or become cash flow positive or profitable at any time in the future 
limited resources building an advanced network service is a complex process that requires significant engineering and financial resources 
among other things  to implement its advanced network service  the company must develop certain technologies and license other technologies from third parties  establish strategic distribution and development arrangements and undertake a substantial marketing campaign 
the company has limited technical  sales and marketing staffs and there can be no assurance that such personnel will be able to manage and successfully complete all of the tasks necessary to develop and launch the company s advanced network service 
in addition  because the company has generated minimal revenues to date and does not expect to generate substantial revenues in  the company must conserve cash 
as a result  the company may not be able to fund the marketing efforts required to successfully introduce the service to customers 
alternatively  market acceptance for its advanced network service may overwhelm the company s limited staffs such that the company is unable to adequately respond to and satisfy customers demand for the advanced network service 
the company s failure to develop and launch its advanced network service  or to respond to market demand for its advanced network service  will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
technology development the company s future success is based substantially upon its ability to develop new technology to enable it to provide as well as bill for an advanced network service  and to enhance and extend its existing products and technologies 
software product development schedules are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools and learning processes associated with development of new technologies  as well as other factors 
the company has in the past experienced delays in its software development efforts and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future delays in connection with its current development or future development activities 
delays or difficulties associated with the development of new  and the enhancement of existing  technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  software products as complex as those being developed for the company s advanced network service frequently contain undetected errors or shortcomings  and may fail to perform or to scale as expected 
although the company has tested and will continue to test its advanced network service prior to releasing it  such tests may not accurately simulate actual use of the service by customers 
as a result  errors may be found in the advanced network service after it is commercially released which may result in loss of or a delay in market acceptance of the company s advanced network service 
distribution risks in connection with the change in its business strategy  the company must establish and maintain relationships with new distribution channels for its advanced network service and datarover devices 
the company believes that in order to successfully market its advanced network service  it must  among other things  enter into distribution arrangements with telephony providers such as wireless and wireline carriers  as well as resellers  device manufacturers and internet service providers 
competition in establishing such relationships is extremely intense 
in addition  decisions by such parties  particularly cellular carriers  to enter into a distribution relationship with the company can entail a lengthy process during which the company may be required to incur significant expenditures without any assurance of success 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in establishing distribution relationships  or that if established  the company will be able to maintain such relationships or that such relationships will result in sales of the company s advanced network service 
the failure of the company to establish and then successfully maintain distribution relationships for its advanced network service will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company plans to distribute its datarover family of products through a variety of distribution channels  including a direct sales force  value added resellers vars and outside sales representatives 
to date  the company has established distribution arrangements with one var  the fuld institute for technology in nursing education 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish distribution relationships with additional vars and outside sales representatives for its datarover products 
the company s failure to establish  or if established  successfully maintain such relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
lengthy sales cycles sales of the company s datarover devices depend  in significant part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to choose handheld devices as a means of communication for its employees 
as a result  the amount of time from the initial contact with a customer to the customer s placement of an order may range from a few weeks to many months  depending on such factors as the amount of time required to test and customize the datarover device for the particular customer 
if a customer decides not to purchase the datarover devices  the company may not have another opportunity to sell its handheld devices to that customer for a number of years  if at all 
for these and other reasons  the company expects its datarover products will have a lengthy sales cycle during which the company may expend substantial funds and significant sales and technical effort 
there can be no assurance that the company s expenditures or efforts during the lengthy sales process with any potential customer will result in sales 
dependence on emerging markets  acceptance of the company s services and products the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on the growth in demand for an advanced network service by mobile business professionals and other consumers 
this market is new and emerging  is rapidly evolving  is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants and will be subject to frequent and continuing changes in customer preferences and technology 
as is typical in new and evolving markets  demand and market acceptance for the company s technologies is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
because the market for the company s advanced network service is evolving  it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the size or growth rate  if any  of this market 
there can be no assurance that the market for the company s advanced network service will develop  or that it will not develop more slowly than expected or attract new competitors 
in addition  even if a market develops for an advanced network service  there can be no assurance that the markets for the company s service will develop  or that the company s service will be adopted 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or attracts new competitors  or if the company s advanced network service does not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
dependence on third party technology and products to develop its advanced network service  the company has incorporated and will continue to incorporate technology developed by third parties 
in addition to all the risks associated with the development of complex technologies  the company has limited control over whether or when such third party technologies will be developed or enhanced 
a third party s failure to timely develop or license the software technology  or the occurrence of errors in such technology  could prevent or delay introduction or market acceptance of the company s advanced network service  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
with respect to its datarover devices  the company has entered into an oem agreement with oki electric for the manufacture of datarover devices 
to the extent oki electric fails to timely manufacture the datarover devices or meet the company s volume and quality requirements and delivery schedules  which has occurred in the past  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because the company currently depends solely on oki electric for the manufacture of its datarover devices  in the event oki electric were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture the datarover devices  the company would be required to identify and qualify an acceptable replacement 
the process of qualifying another manufacturer could be lengthy  and no assurance can be given that another manufacturer would be available to the company on a timely basis 
because oki electric is located in japan  the company is also directly affected by the political and economic conditions of this region and subject to the risks normally attendant to the conduct of foreign trade  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and longer delivery times 
competition many of the companies with which the company competes  or which are expected to offer products or services based on alternatives to the company s technologies  have substantially greater financial resources  research and development capabilities  sales and marketing staffs  and better developed distribution channels than the company 
there can be no assurance that the services and products that the company offers will achieve sufficient quality  functionality or cost effectiveness to compete with existing or future alternatives 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing products or services which are more effective and lower cost than those offered by the company  or which render the company s advanced network service or datarover devices obsolete 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside its control 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for the company s services and products are the availability of the company s products and services  the quality  performance and functionality of the advanced network service and datarover products developed and marketed by the company  the effectiveness of the company in marketing and distributing its products and services  and price 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new technologies  products or services introduced by existing competitors and by new companies entering the market 
intellectual property the company seeks to protect its proprietary information and technology through contractual confidentiality provisions and the application for united states and foreign patents  trademarks and copyrights 
there can be no assurance of patents  trademarks or copyrights or that third parties will not seek to challenge  invalidate or circumvent such applications or resulting patents  trademarks or copyrights 
additionally  competitors may independently develop equivalent or superior  non infringing technologies 
the company s revenue could be adversely affected to the extent that such technologies avoid infringement of the company s patents 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against the company and that such claims will not lead to litigation and or require the company to significantly modify or even discontinue sales of certain of its products 
any such event may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial conditions 
potential security issues the implementation of the advanced network service poses several security issues  including the possibility of break ins and other similar disruptions 
the company intends to incorporate authentication  encryption and other security technologies in its advanced network service 
however  there can be no assurance that such technology will be adequate to prevent break ins 
in addition  as is generally known  weaknesses in the medium by which users may access the company s advanced network service  including the internet  telephones  cellular phones and other wireless devices  may compromise the security of the confidential electronic information accessed from the advanced network service 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide a safe and secure advanced network service 
the company s failure to provide a secure advanced network service may result in significant liability to the company and may deter potential users of the service 
the company intends to limit its liability to users  including liability arising from failure of the authentication  encryption and other security technologies that will be incorporated into its advanced network service  through contractual provisions 
however  there can be no assurance that such limitations will be effective 
the company currently does not have liability insurance to protect against risks associated with forced break ins or disruptions 
there can be no assurance that security vulnerabilities and weaknesses will not be discovered in the company s advanced network service or licensed technology incorporated into such service or in the mediums by which subscribers access the advanced network service 
any security problems in the advanced network service or the licensed technology incorporated in such service may require significant expenditures of capital and resources by the company to alleviate such problems  may result in lawsuits against the company  may limit the number of users of the advanced network service and may cause interruptions or delays in the development and completion of  or the cessation of  the company s advanced network service 
any such expenditures  lawsuits  reduction of users  interruptions or delays in the development and commercial release of the advanced network service  or the cessation of such service by the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
personnel the company must continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
silicon valley remains a highly competitive job market  and there can be no assurance that key company management and engineering personnel will remain employed by the company  or that the company will be able to attract sufficient additional personnel to execute its business plan 
the company experienced significant attrition of engineering  marketing  administrative and sales personnel during the latter part of and the first half of  including an approximate one half reduction in its workforce between october and january these reductions adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company s current employees will continue to work for the company or that the company will be able to obtain the services of additional personnel necessary for the company s growth 
failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technological change the communications technology market is characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s products and services obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to timely develop and introduce new products and services  including the advanced network service  as well as enhancements to such products and services  to keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the user 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  or that its new products and services will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to timely develop and introduce new products and services in response to changing market conditions or consumer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
dependence on and responsiveness to the internet the company believes that its future success is in part dependent upon continued growth in the use of the internet 
the internet may prove not to be a viable means of conducting commerce or communications for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  potentially unreliable network infrastructure  or untimely development of performance improvements including high speed modems 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on it by any such growth 
failure of the internet as a mode of conducting commerce and communications could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
year compliance the company uses a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems in its internal operations  including applications used in financial business systems and various administration functions 
to the extent that these software applications contain source code that is unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year  some level of modification or even replacement of such source code or applications will be necessary 
the company is in the process of identifying the software applications that are not year compliant 
given the information known at this time about the company s systems  coupled with the company s ongoing efforts to upgrade or replace business critical systems as necessary  it is currently not anticipated that these year costs will have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  the company is still analyzing its software applications and  to the extent they are not fully year compliant  there can be no assurance that the costs necessary to update software or potential systems interruptions would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
single california location currently  the company s only network operations center is located at its office in sunnyvale  california 
operation of the advanced network service is dependent in part upon the company s ability to protect the network operation center against physical damage from power outages  telecommunications failures  physical break ins and other similar events 
in addition northern california historically has been vulnerable to certain natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and pose physical risks to the company s property 
the company presently does not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a technical failure of its advanced network service or a natural disaster 
in the event of such a failure or disaster  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected
