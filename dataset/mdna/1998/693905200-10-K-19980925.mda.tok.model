management is of the opinion that such sources of cash are sufficient for the ensuing fiscal year 
certain trends and uncertainties the company has in the past and may in the future make forward looking state ments 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following technological change and competition the markets for the company s products are characterized by frequent new product introductions and declining average selling prices over product life cycles 
the company s future success is highly dependent upon the timely completion and introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels 
in addition  the company must respond to competitors in the company s markets 
if the company is not able to make timely introduction of new products or to respond effectively to competition  its business and operating results could be adversely affected 
variable demand the consumer adhesives industry has historically been reasonably stable and not characterized by cyclical product demand 
the manicure implement business cook bates has had seasonal demand peaks during the last half of the calendar year 
political and economic considerations in recent years  a significant portion of the company s net sales and operating profit growth have come from international revenues 
as a result  the company s business activities and its results could be significantly affected by the policies of foreign governments and prevailing political  social  and economic conditions 
the company s revenue during fiscal year was not materially impacted by the widespread weakness in asian currencies and it is not certain what the long term effect of the weakness of asian currencies and the liquidity situation will be on our business 
availability of raw materials the consumer adhesive and manicure implement industries have ample manufactur ing capacity and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if its raw material suppliers are unwilling or unable to supply a timely and sufficient supply of product to the company 
intellectual property matters the consumer adhesive industry is characterized by minimal litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has on occasion been notified that it may be infringing patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing products from the company have rights to indemnification and may  under certain circumstances violate the intellectual property rights of others 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations  and the company has successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that the company will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
year risks the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the appli cation of computer programs which have been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year of business transactions 
most of the company s operating systems with year issues have been modified to address those issues  accordingly  management does not anticipate any significant costs  problems or uncertainties associated with becoming year compliant 
the company is currently developing a plan to assure that its internal suppliers  customers and creditors successfully face the year issue 
a failure to successfully address the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
therefore  the company is in the process of developing contingency plans along with its remediation efforts for continuing operations in the event such problems arise
