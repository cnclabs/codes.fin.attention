item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing  distribution and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company adhered to its strategy of expanding its precipitated calcium carbonate pcc product line 
the company commenced operations at five new satellite pcc plants in five different countries indonesia  slovakia  the united states  finland and south africa and signed agreements for construction of six new satellite plants four of which are now under construction 
these satellite pcc plants are located in france  germany and the united states  and together have production capacity equivalent to approximately seven satellite units 
a satellite unit is equivalent to annual production capacity of between  and  tons of pcc 
the company has signed three contracts for the use of its patented acid tolerant pcc technology 
this will enable the company to expand its sales to makers of groundwood paper grades 
in addition  the company expanded several satellite plants at various locations around the world 
as a result  sales of pcc as a percentage of the company s total net sales  which were in  had risen to by the company expects this trend to continue as sales and volume growth of pcc continues to outpace such growth in the processed minerals and refractory product lines 
presently  the company operates or has under construction satellite pcc plants in countries worldwide 
the company is optimistic that volume growth will continue in the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur in and also expects to sign contracts for additional satellite pcc plants in the united states and abroad 
in  the company plans to continue its focus on the following growth strategies for the pcc product line continued efforts to increase market penetration in north america  europe  latin america  the pacific rim and elsewhere 
continued expansions of the capacity of existing satellite pcc plants in response to increased demand  which is resulting from either increased pcc filler levels in paper or the installation of new paper machines 
continued research and development and marketing efforts of acid tolerant pcc  coating pcc and other products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
to date  the company s experience with extensions and renewals of its satellite pcc agreements has been favorable 
there is no assurance  however  that these contracts will be renewed prior to or at their respective expiration dates 
the company will continue to emphasize specialty products in its refractory product lines and commercialize products  processes and equipment through research and development efforts 
as the company continues to expand its operations overseas  it faces inherent risks of doing business abroad  including exchange rate fluctuations  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds and other factors 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper  steel and construction industries 
the recent exchange rate movements and economic problems in southeast asia are an indication of foreign business risks experienced by multinational corporations 
however  the company s asian operations are a minor part of its overall business 
in  they represented approximately of total sales  while japan and australia accounted for about of total asian sales 
continued uncertainties in thailand  indonesia and south korea could have adverse repercussions in other parts of asia and conceivably in europe and north america
