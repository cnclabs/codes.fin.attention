see item business general in this annual report 
operations compared to sales for improved over led by the textile chemical specialties segment  which grew 
sales in the environmental products and services segment increased compared with the prior year 
the growth in the textile chemical specialties segment resulted primarily from combined north america and asia textile chemical sales which increased over this was the result of the initial five months of sales from the acquisition in late july of the garment processing and textile chemical business from ivax industries  strong growth in mexico  taiwan  korea and canada  new product introduction and market expansion in several southern states  and increased custom toll manufacturing in the related organics business 
these more than offset the continued weakness in the us textile markets 
sales in europe improved  in terms of us dollars 
this resulted from a substantial physical quantity increase of due to geographic market expansion and new product sales  which more than overcame an overall average selling price decrease and a net negative currency impact of approximately primarily related to the stronger us dollar versus the dutch guilder 
the three major product lines in the environmental products and services segment all showed modest improvements over the prior year 
the increase in the ion exchange product line was primarily a result of new and regained customers and an overall volume increase in the household resin market 
the full year impact of the acquisition of chemical images in june and new toner business contributed to the improvement in the specialty polymer product line 
the biochemical product line increase was due to substantial improvements in europe primarily in consumer  marine  industrial and municipal applications  and increased usage in the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater in the us  all somewhat offset by a downturn in the consumer product line in the us overall average selling prices in this segment were relatively flat in versus the prior year 
the gross margin for was  a substantial improvement over the experienced the prior year 
gross margins in the textile chemicals specialties segment increased to versus last year s rate of 
margins in the north america and asia markets improved to in from last year s due to new product sales which command a higher margin  the elimination of several low margin products in the us  a slight decrease in raw material costs  substantial sales increases in mexico which carry higher margins  and additional cost controls 
in the organics chemical business  margins also improved primarily as the result of the increase in higher margin toll manufacturing 
the margins in europe increased to from in this improvement was due to the continued favorable impact of a weaker dutch guilder as compared with certain other european currencies  coupled with new product sales that carry higher margins 
year to year improvements in all the product lines in the environmental products and services segment resulted in a gross margin of for this segment  as compared to in margins in the ion exchange product line were impacted by lower raw material costs  production related efficiencies and improved fixed cost controls 
these offset a slight decrease in average selling prices and higher freight costs 
costs for styrene  the major raw material  remained stable 
production efficiencies and improved cost controls helped improve the margins in the specialty polymers product line 
biochemical margins increased over due to an overall average selling price increase  production efficiencies and a favorable product customer mix 
operating expenses as a percent of sales were in  essentially unchanged from s mark of 
the textile chemical specialties segment expenses as a percent of sales in decreased to from in  primarily the result of favorable impacts from europe due to the dutch guilder dollar exchange rate and lower environmental costs 
operating expenses as a percent of sales in the environmental products and services segment increased to from last year 
this was primarily the result of increased legal accruals primarily in the ion exchange product line  higher provisions for doubtful accounts in specialty polymers  and overall stepped up marketing efforts in several of the segment s product lines 
the company s provision for income taxes was computed using applicable prevailing income tax rates 
the company s effective tax rate of for was only slightly higher than last year s rate of 
other income expense was million for versus million in last year s comparable period 
the increase was primarily due to million in costs associated with the terminated merger agreement transaction coupled with 
million in foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of asian currencies  primarily the korean won 
compared to total sales increased in as compared to the prior year on the strength of a improvement in the textile chemical specialties segment 
sales in the environmental products and services segment declined by in compared to in the textile chemical specialties segment  sales in the north america  asia and europe divisions improved over the prior year 
north america and asia division sales improved by over a substantial increase in textile chemical volume in mexico  smaller increases in canada and taiwan  new product sales in the us  and the impact of the first full year of sales in korea more than offset the continued general weakness in the us textile market  the decline in the related organic chemicals business due to reduced customer toll manufacturing requirements  and a slight drop in average us selling prices 
europe division sales improved in terms of us dollars and in terms of local currencies 
physical volume increased primarily due to the company s continued success in penetrating newer geographical markets as well as new product introductions 
overall selling prices in terms of dutch guilders improved versus the prior year 
sales in the environmental product and services segment were favorably impacted by improvement in two product lines 
biochemical sales improved due to increased volume in products for the institutional  consumer and bioremediation markets  combined with a slight selling price increase 
specialty polymers sales improved due to an increase in average selling prices and the impact of the mid year purchase of the specialty polymers business of the chemical images co 
more than offsetting these improvements was a substantial decline in membrane sales which resulted from significantly lower export volume and an average selling price decrease 
continued weak market conditions in the us and a drop in average selling prices resulted in lower sales volume in the ion exchange product line 
the overall gross margin for increased to from in as both of the company s segments showed year to year improvements 
in the textile chemicals specialties segment  the gross margin increased to from the prior year s 
the gross margin in north america and asia increased almost percentage point to due to reduced freight expenses  production improvements and lower raw material costs 
these were partially offset by a slight reduction in selling prices and higher manufacturing expenses 
selling price increases  new products selling at higher margins  lower raw material costs and the continued favorable currency impact of a weaker dutch guilder as compared with the other european currencies  all combined to increase the gross margin in europe to from in the gross margin in the environmental products and services segment was in  an improvement of almost two percent compared to the prior year 
gross margin in the ion exchange product line improved as a result of lower raw material costs  primarily styrene  and production cost controls  partially offset by lower selling prices  increased freight costs  unfavorable manufacturing variances and reduced inventory levels 
gross margin also increased significantly in the specialty polymer product line due to higher overall average selling prices  reduced raw material costs  principally styrene  and the favorable impact of higher margins gained from the june purchase of the chemical images specialty polymer business 
biochemical product line margins showed a small increase due to a slight decrease in raw material costs combined with a slight increase in selling prices 
the membrane product line gross margin declined in as compared with due to overall average selling price decreases and unfavorable manufacturing inventory variances which were partially offset by lower raw material costs and continued cost controls 
operating expenses as a percent of sales for increased to as compared to for in the textile chemical specialties segment  expenses as a percentage of sales increased as a result of headcount additions in r d and marketing in north america and increased environmental  compensation and legal costs 
similarly  marketing staff additions  higher legal and compensation costs and the slightly lower overall sales also resulted in an increase in the environmental products and services segment expenses as a percent of sales 
the company s provision for income taxes was computed using applicable prevailing income tax rates 
the company s effective tax rate of for was essentially equal to the applicable rate for other income expense was million for versus million in lower interest expense related to a reduction in the amount of outstanding debt  lower amortization expense and the absence of a large non recurring translation loss on europe intercompany accounts resulted in over a million favorable year to year comparison 
environmental matters the manufacture of the company s products  and in some cases their storage  transportation and disposal  involve a number of environmental considerations 
see item environmental matters in this annual report and note commitments and contingencies  to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
during  and the company incurred approximately   and  respectively  of costs in connection with the ongoing review of possible soil and ground water contamination at its birmingham  new jersey facility and approximately   and  respectively  in measuring the extent of contamination at its wellford  south carolina facility 
since july  the company has incurred approximately million in costs in order to identify and remediate certain soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities which it currently or formerly occupied in the state of new jersey 
approximately million of these expenditures were charged against the liability established at the time the company acquired the sybron chemical group from sybron corporation 
the remaining expenditures have been treated as land improvements 
during   and the company spent approximately   and  respectively  to identify and remediate certain soil contamination at its facility in ede  holland which existed at the time the company acquired this facility from sybron corporation 
approximately  and  of the costs incurred in and  respectively  were charged against amounts previously reserved 
the cost of remediating contamination at the company s existing facilities is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s annual operating results  cash flow or financial condition 
at december   the company has accrued approximately  to offset future environmental assessment and remediation costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  were million over the december  balance of million  an increase of 
net cash flow generated by operating activities totaled million for the year versus million for the same period in this increase principally was due to increased net income and higher payable balances  including a million tax refund paid in error by the netherlands government 
this refund was returned to the taxing authorities early in higher accounts receivable and inventory balances due to increased business activity were the principal uses of operating cash 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million for as compared with million for the comparable period 
this increase was the result of the ivax acquisition in july  coupled with higher capital expenditures in due to manufacturing plant upgrades in the us and mexico 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year was million primarily due to funding the ivax acquisition versus a million net cash usage for the year the company has a million unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit with corestates bank  which expires in february the amount owed under this credit facility was million as of december  the company expects its capital expenditures for existing operations to be somewhat lower than the levels 
the company believes that anticipated cash flow from operations  its working capital and amounts available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital requirements through however  the company may seek  as required  equity or debt financing to provide capital to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible business acquisitions  which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the nature and size of strategic business opportunities that the company may elect to pursue 
foreign exchange the company has subsidiaries in europe  asia  africa and the americas and  for all subsidiaries  except the company s mexican subsidiary  the company has determined the functional currencies are the subsidiaries local currency 
the company s mexican subsidiary s functional currency is considered to be the us dollar because of that country s designation as a highly inflationary economy 
the company has a large manufacturing facility in ede  holland where chemicals are manufactured and sold either directly to customers or to various subsidiaries  which are principally in europe 
intercompany balances arise between the dutch operation and various subsidiaries 
overall  the company recognized an exchange loss of million in the twelve month period ended december  versus currency exchange income of million in the similar period in year based on a preliminary study  the company expects to spend and expense approximately 
million from through to modify its computer information systems enabling proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond 
the company continues to evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action  including replacement of certain systems whose associated costs would be recorded as assets and amortized 
the company has initiated a project in europe to replace existing business and accounting systems 
the new system will accommodate the adoption of the euro currency  and is also year compliant 
the company expects to incur capital expenditures of less than million  primarily for computer hardware and software  related to this system implementation project 
such amounts are included in the estimated capital expenditures discussed above 
internal staffing costs and all reengineering costs  if any  associated with this and any other system implementation project will be expensed as incurred 
accordingly  the company does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next two years to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations nor does it currently anticipate any material disruption in its business operations as a consequence of the year issue 
inflations and trends united states average selling prices in the us increased by less than during overall raw material costs dropped 
the cost of styrene  one of the major raw materials in the environmental products and services segment  remained relatively flat in versus the prior year 
europe average selling prices in the europe division s textile chemical product line dropped while raw material costs increased slightly 
sales growth in the textile chemical specialties segment for should be favorably impacted by the full year effect of the ivax acquisition 
the company is focusing on increasing market penetration in existing major markets such as the us and europe and growing developing markets in latin america  asia  eastern europe and the middle east 
the company will continue new product development including more environmental friendly alternatives for existing products 
growth opportunities in the environmental product and services segment include further penetration into the toner and laser printer markets  increased share of the us and export ion exchange markets  and expansion of the biochemical waste treatment and consumer institutional business in the us and europe 
in addition  the company continues to actively pursue niche acquisitions that  together with synergies gained with the existing businesses  would provide both top and bottom line growth and accretive earnings per share
