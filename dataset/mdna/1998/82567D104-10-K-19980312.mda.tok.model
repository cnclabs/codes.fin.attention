item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures o selective disposition 
we regularly review our portfolio compared to established internal standards and identify those few properties which can not economically meet these standards 
we intend to dispose of these properties over time 
marketing and market research we employ various means to increase our share of the self storage market 
we place prominent advertisements in the yellow pages and seek to promote customer awareness of our stores through highly visible store locations  site signage and architectural features 
we locate our stores along retail and high traffic corridors  usually with significant road frontage to increase visibility 
we build  on newly developed stores  a distinctive lighthouse office to distinguish ourself from competitors and to increase customer awareness of the shurgard brand 
primary marketing emphasis is placed on providing managers with telephone sales skills to elicit customer needs and turn prospects into customers 
we also have a national call center to field overflow calls from individual properties 
employees at the national call center are able to rent a unit at the store most convenient to the customer 
the company has sophisticated market research skills  and maintains an extensive market research database on its primary markets that permits it to closely track occupancy levels  rental rates and other operational data regarding self storage properties within these markets 
we have also conducted focus group research and telephone surveys  and utilize customer comment cards to identify the primary considerations in customers self storage choices and satisfaction so that we can better attract and service customers 
we are testing a new strategy that makes storage more visible and more convenient to potential customers 
in  we added kiosks in major malls in portland  or  san francisco  ca and the seattle  wa metropolitan area 
these kiosks a sales counter located in the center of malls are staffed with trained sales representatives who are available to answer questions about both self storage and containerized storage 
they have computer links to area storage centers through which they can give rate and availability information and lease units or containers to customers on the spot 
property management systems management information systems the company has integrated property management systems and procedures for marketing  advertising  leasing  operations  maintenance and security of properties and the management of on site personnel 
our computerized management information system links our corporate office with each store 
during  we completed the development and installation of proprietary software that expedites internal auditing  financial statement and budget preparations  allows the daily exchange of information with our corporate office  and manages detailed information with respect to the tenant mix  demographics  occupancy levels  rental rates  revenue optimization  payroll and other information relating to each store 
additionally  we have purchased a new network based accounting package that will aid in the compilation and dissemination of information from our stores 
we believe that this new information system will be adequate to support the management of our currently owned properties as well as planned future growth 
we have evaluated our exposure regarding any potential computer system problems related to the new millennium 
because we have recently replaced most of our internal systems  we believe our exposure for internal systems is not material 
we will need to replace our network software at an estimated cost of  and of our older store gate control systems at an estimated cost of  we are currently in the process of evaluating our external interface systems  which include our electronic fund transfer software and credit card equipment 
other activities the company also manages  under the shurgard name  self storage properties owned by others that meet our quality standards 
management of such properties enables us to spread the cost of overhead over a greater number of properties 
additionally  it enables us to expand our presence in the markets in which we operate  to offer customers a broader geographic selection of self storage properties to suit their needs and to establish relationships with property owners that may lead to future acquisitions 
management fees earned by the company are not qualifying income for reit qualification purposes 
accordingly  we closely monitor the level of these activities to ensure our continued qualification as a reit 
growth strategies our growth strategies are designed to maximize shareholder value by increasing funds from operations through i increases in revenue and operating efficiencies at existing stores and ii the development of new self storage properties and the acquisition of additional self storage properties 
we have an integrated real estate and storage operations management team which combines its experience to implement our growth plan 
we believe that the experience of our management team in operating  developing and acquiring self storage properties and our access to capital markets strongly contribute to our ability to execute these strategies 
internal growth strategy our internal growth strategy is to increase same store cash flow by achieving the highest rental rate structure consistent with strong occupancy rates  containing costs and improving operating leverage  and undertaking expansion of our existing stores 
o revenue optimization 
we seek to optimize our revenue by achieving the highest rental rate structure for our stores  consistent with strong levels of occupancy  through the use of teams of store employees who are trained and authorized to set rental rates and make rental rate changes based on their analysis of demand and availability at a particular store 
we encourage decentralized decisions by store managers to change marginal rental rates in order to ensure a fast  flexible response to changing market conditions 
store managers evaluate their property s rental rates on a periodic basis  based on unit demand and unit availability  and can quickly change marginal rental rates to ensure that revenue is optimized 
o cost containment and improved operating leverage 
we seek to maximize cash flow by carefully containing operating expenses 
for example  we aggressively appeal our real estate tax assessments 
in addition  as the company increases the number of properties in its targeted markets  it achieves larger economies of scale and lessens the impact of corporate overhead expense 
the company believes that its management and operational procedures  which can be implemented over a large number of properties  enable it to add new properties with little additional overhead expense 
o strategic build outs 
we seek to maximize revenue by building out additional rentable storage space at suitable stores either through on site expansion or acquisition of property adjacent to existing stores 
we receive high incremental returns on such build out investments  because resulting revenue increases are achieved with little increase in fixed operating costs 
external growth strategy our external growth strategy is to develop new  high quality self storage properties and to selectively acquire additional self storage properties that meet or can be upgraded to our standards 
in general  we plan to develop or acquire new properties primarily in our existing markets and in new markets that create economies of scale with our current network of stores 
we seek to own at least stores in each of our markets in order to realize operating and marketing efficiencies and increase brand awareness 
we believe that the experience of our management team in developing and acquiring self storage properties strengthens our ability to pursue our external growth strategy 
we favor development or acquisition of self storage properties in major metropolitan markets  located near retail or high traffic corridors  usually with significant road frontage to increase visibility 
we rely on our market personnel to target areas in which to develop and acquire new stores 
we utilize our staff of real estate professionals in various markets around the nation to develop and acquire new stores in the markets presenting the best business opportunities 
we have developed comprehensive market expansion plans for each of our target markets  and use these plans as the basis for selecting new store locations and acquisition targets 
the market expansion plans utilize a demographic analysis of an area along with an evaluation of competitors locations  rates and product quality to determine the optimum number and location of new stores 
management believes that  under current market conditions  development will generally provide superior long term returns when compared to acquisitions of similar size  quality and location 
based on this belief  our current growth plan focuses heavily on property development  however  management continually analyzes market conditions and acquisition opportunities 
development 
we believe that several factors favor our development strategy o development expertise 
we have substantial construction management and architectural experience that was acquired over the past years 
the company or its predecessors developed more than a third of the properties we currently own or manage  and  since  we have maintained an internal development staff  which currently employs people 
o strategic site selection to maximize revenue 
to obtain the best store locations  we target sites for development in urban areas and up scale retail areas that often require rezoning and other complex development measures 
we believe that the difficulties of developing storage properties in such in fill areas may discourage competitors from locating nearby and  as a result  enable us to operate in areas that are underserved 
this in turn enables us to charge higher rental rates 
o focus on quality and brand image development 
by developing our own self storage properties  we gain greater control to ensure excellent construction and consistent building design that is inviting to customers 
we believe our focus on quality and consistency will enable us to further strengthen awareness of the shurgard brand  obtain repeat business  maintain premium prices and differentiate ourself from our competitors 
the historical results of recent development partnerships sponsored by the management company demonstrate the superior returns possible through development 
the development properties completed from to are currently returning on original property costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will achieve such returns on our development properties 
future development may differ materially from results of past development properties 
factors that may lead to different results include  but are not limited to  the possibility of more competition to our new developments than was experienced in the periods in which these partnerships were renting up their developments  the quality and location of the competing projects being built  and the possibility that the metropolitan markets in which we are developing may have less favorable supply and demand characteristics 
acquisitions 
we also selectively acquire high quality properties that provide a strategic advantage to the company 
additional acquisitions allow us to spread overhead and certain management  marketing and advertising costs over a greater number of revenue producing assets 
as a result  we can achieve increasing economies of scale with each new property acquired 
we complete a thorough analysis of each property that we intend to acquire  including  but not limited to  a review of capital expenditures that will be required for the property to meet our standards and  at a minimum  a phase i environmental assessment report 
shurgard storage to go  inc stg our customer service focus means that we are continually exploring new ways to serve our customers storage needs 
one of the ways we have broadened our ability to meet customer needs is by bringing storage directly to the customer through containerized storage 
weatherized x x storage containers are delivered to customers for packing 
the containers are then picked up and delivered to a warehouse where they are stored 
the customer may access their storage container in a showroom at the warehouse or have it redelivered to their home 
in addition to the monthly rental charge  service fees may be charged for pickup and delivery 
this business venture is currently operating in the seattle  portland  san francisco  atlanta  and chicago markets 
as of december   we had invested million in shurgard storage to go  inc stg 
we have committed to contribute an additional  and lend up to million under an unsecured five year note 
additionally  we have guaranteed million in lease obligations 
we own only nonvoting stock in this start up venture which is not a qualified reit subsidiary and is subject to corporate level tax 
capital strategy we expect to fund future developments and acquisitions through the incurrence of additional indebtedness  future offerings of equity securities  and retained cash flow 
in the long term  we anticipate reducing our payout ratio in order to retain cash flow for growth 
to fund development and acquisitions  we have up to million available pursuant to our revolving domestic credit facility 
the actual amount available under this revolving credit facility varies based on the terms of the agreement 
at december   based on those terms  the company could borrow the entire million 
the company s european subsidiary anticipates financing growth through a combination of equity and debt financing which will be invested primarily by a joint venture in which we have an interest 
this joint venture will in turn be funded through debt financing 
we anticipate that cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for debt service payments until maturity  as well as for distribution payments in accordance with reit requirements 
we anticipate refinancing outstanding debt upon maturity through long term debt or equity or some combination thereof 
under our by laws  subject to certain exceptions  we may not incur debt if  after giving effect to such borrowing  our indebtedness for borrowed funds would exceed of our total assets or of our adjusted net worth as such terms are defined in the by laws 
as of december   our indebtedness was approximately of our total assets and approximately of our adjusted net worth 
during  in order to mitigate our currency exchange and interest rate risk  the board of directors authorized us to contract with financial institutions for hedging  exchanging  or entering into one or more swap transactions up to the full amount of capital used outside the united states 
our policy specifically prohibits us from entering into any such contract solely to secure profit by speculating on the direction of currency exchange rates if unrelated to capital borrowed  lent or invested by us 
the self storage industry the self storage industry serves an important function in the commercial and residential real estate markets 
self storage properties were first developed in the early s in the southwestern united states in response to the growing need for low cost  accessible storage 
a number of factors accelerated the demand for low cost storage  including  among others  a more mobile society  with individuals moving to new homes and new cities needing short term storage for their belongings  the increasing cost of housing resulting in smaller houses  the increased popularity of apartments and condominiums  more individuals with growing discretionary income resulting in the purchase of items such as boats and recreational vehicles that cannot be stored at residences  the growing number of small businesses and the escalating cost of other storage alternatives 
as the demand for such storage increased  and the acceptance of self storage became more widespread  self storage properties were built throughout the united states 
generally  such properties were constructed along major thoroughfares that provided ready access and public visibility or in outlying areas where land was inexpensive 
in certain areas of the country  where new construction was impractical because of construction costs  lack of suitable sites or other restrictions  older structures have been converted into self storage properties 
we believe  based on our experience  that the self storage industry is characterized by fragmented ownership  high gross margins  low levels of price sensitivity and increasing customer demand 
typical customers of a self storage property include individuals  ranging from homeowners to college students  and commercial users  such as sales representatives and distributors  who require frequent access  and business owners requiring seasonal storage 
we believe business use is a growing segment of demand in the industry 
a single customer rarely occupies more than or of the net rentable area in any particular store 
capital expenditures are generally less for self storage properties as compared to other types of commercial real estate due to the properties structural simplicity and durable materials and the lack of tenant improvement demands 
primary capital expenditures include periodic expenditures for replacing roofs and pavement  as well as improvements such as expansions and unit reconfigurations 
expense items include repairing asphalt  doors  fences and masonry walls  maintaining landscaping  and repairing damage caused by customer vehicles 
minimal maintenance is required to a storage unit when vacated to prepare it for the next customer 
competition competition exists in every market in which our stores are located 
as a result  we compete with  among others  national  regional and local self storage operators and developers 
the primary factors on which competition is based are location  rental rates  security  suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed 
we believe that the primary competition for potential customers of any of our self storage centers comes from other self storage properties within a five mile radius of that store 
we have positioned our stores within their respective markets as a high quality operator that emphasizes customer service and security 
we do not seek to be the lowest price storage provider 
entry into the self storage business through acquisition of existing properties is relatively easy for persons or institutions with the required initial capital 
some of our competitors may have more resources than the company 
competition may be accelerated by any increase in availability of funds for investment in real estate 
decreases in interest rates tend to increase the availability of funds and therefore can increase the growth of competition 
due to recent increases in plans for development of self storage properties  we anticipate that increased available storage space will continue to reduce occupancy levels per storage property in certain markets in and further intensify competition among storage providers for available tenants in those markets 
the extent to which we are affected by competition will depend in significant part on local market conditions 
regulation environmental regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental regulations that apply to the ownership  management and development of real property  including regulations affecting both construction activities and the operation of self storage properties 
in developing properties and constructing improvements  we utilize environmental consultants and or governmental data to determine whether there are any flood plains  wetlands or environmentally sensitive areas that are part of the property to be developed 
if any such areas are identified  development and construction are planned in conformance with federal  state  and local environmental and land use requirements 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its property 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell the property or to borrow using the property as collateral  and may cause the owner or manager of the property to incur substantial remediation costs 
in addition to claims for cleanup costs  the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in the owner or manager incurring substantial liabilities as a result of a claim by a private party for personal injury or a claim by an adjacent property owner for property damage 
we have notified the missouri department of natural resources of elevated levels of hydrocarbons found in groundwater monitoring wells on a property in st 
louis  missouri 
we have been monitoring in accordance with a work plan approved by the mdnr 
the source of the contamination is unknown at this time  and further investigation is necessary to determine what steps  if any  are appropriate to remediate 
except for this property in st 
louis  we have not been notified by any governmental authority of any current  material environmental noncompliance  claim or liability in connection with any of the properties it owns or manages 
we have not been notified of a current claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party in connection with any of the properties in connection with environmental conditions 
we have received a phase i environmental assessment report prepared by an independent environmental consultant for each of the properties we own 
we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to the properties we own or manage including the missouri property discussed above  that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that any environmental assessments undertaken with respect to the properties have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of the properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  or that an environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the properties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
in addition  there can be no assurance that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability  ii the current environmental condition of our owned or managed properties will not be affected by the condition of properties in the vicinity of such properties such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us  or iii tenants will not violate their leases by introducing hazardous or toxic substances into our owned or managed properties that could expose us to liability under federal or state environmental laws 
americans with disabilities act  fire and safety regulations under the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements relating to physical access and use by disabled persons 
compliance might require  among other things  removal of access barriers 
a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines  injunctive relief  damages or attorneys fees 
if we were required to make modifications to comply with the ada  our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected  however  management believes that such effect would not be material 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
compliance with such requirements may require substantial capital expenditures  which would reduce money otherwise available for distribution to shareholders 
insurance we believe that our self storage properties are covered by adequate fire  flood  wind  earthquake and property insurance  as well as business interruption insurance  provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits 
we purchase title insurance on all of our properties at the time of acquisition 
we use our discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of title  casualty and other insurance  based on the purchase price paid for such property  in each case with a view to obtaining appropriate insurance coverage on our properties at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately persons 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
item properties the company owns  as of december   directly and through its subsidiaries and joint ventures  properties including self storage properties located in states and nine located in europe 
our self storage properties are designed to offer accessible storage space for personal and business use 
individuals typically rent individual units in self storage properties for storage of personal belongings such as furniture  appliances  boats and other household and recreational goods 
businesses typically rent space for storage of business property such as equipment  seasonal goods  records and fixtures 
we believe that it is desirable to have commercial customers because they tend to rent larger units  stay for longer terms  are more reliable payers and are less sensitive to price increases 
accordingly  we have marketing programs that target commercial users 
we estimate that commercial users account for approximately of our total occupancy 
our self storage properties are divided into a number of self enclosed rental units that generally range in size from to square feet 
many properties have uncovered storage outside the buildings for parking motor vehicles  boats  campers and other similar items suitable for outside storage 
additionally  a number of our properties include climate controlled storage units for which we charge rents at substantial premiums 
customers of self storage properties are generally responsible for delivering and retrieving their goods 
many leased spaces can be accessed directly by automobile or truck  but some properties  in particular the multistory buildings  have separate loading docks and elevators available for delivery and retrieval of stored goods 
customers generally have access to their unit without additional charge during normal business hours and control access to such space through the use of their personal padlocks 
we offer truck rentals at a majority of our properties for added convenience to our customers and to differentiate ourself from most of our competitors 
in addition to truck rentals  we sell locks  boxes and packing and storage materials at our stores 
the leasing  maintenance and operation of our stores are the responsibility of store managers 
the property s security is provided through a variety of systems that may include  among others  on site personnel  electronic devices such as intrusion and fire alarms  access controls  video and intercom surveillance devices  property fencing and lighting 
although our stores range considerably in size  most properties consist of one or more single story buildings that are located on a site of to acres 
the smallest store has approximately  net rentable square feet  while the largest store has approximately  net rentable square feet 
the properties generally are constructed with concrete block or tilt up concrete panels  with steel columns or precast concrete columns that rest on concrete footings and slabs  and have built up tar roofs or pitched truss roofs with shingles or standing seam metal roofs 
the interior walls are generally constructed with metal studs and partitions or other construction materials that are secure but readily movable 
the parking areas and driveways are generally asphalt or cement 
all stores have fencing  floodlights  and electronic gates 
in some cases  multistory buildings able to bear substantial weight loads  such as warehouses and newspaper plants  have been converted into self storage properties 
in addition  similar multistory buildings for self storage have been constructed in dense urban areas where land costs  zoning and other development considerations make it impractical or undesirable to construct single story buildings

leasing of properties 
rental units are usually rented on a month to month basis 
the average rental period for a tenant is approximately years 
this average is comprised of the rental periods of business tenants  who tend to lease space for longer periods approximately years  and those of residential customers  who tend to lease space for shorter periods approximately six months to a year 
rental income from leased space constitutes the primary revenue from such properties  but additional revenue are received from incidental services rendered at the properties  such as lock and box sales and truck rentals 
rental rates vary substantially depending on the size of the storage space  the property location  the quality of the property and the location of competition within five miles

as of december   we operated a network of more than storage centers located throughout the united states and in europe 
of these properties  we own  directly and through our subsidiaries and joint ventures  operating properties including self storage properties  containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
of these properties  are located in states and nine are located in europe 
self storage properties offer low cost  easily accessible storage space for personal and business uses 
our investment objective is to maximize shareholder value by increasing funds from operations through internal growth and through the acquisition and development of additional self storage properties 
we believe that our access to both the debt and equity markets  the experience of our management team in acquiring  developing  and operating self storage properties  our geographic diversification and our emphasis on quality will enhance our ability to achieve this objective 
our mission is to be the global leader in storage products and services 
we believe we can obtain this goal by focusing on providing exceptional customer service and the highest quality products to our customers 
we believe that in order to supply the best customer service in the industry  we must have employees who are responsive to customer needs 
accordingly  we promote employee empowerment and training programs  as well as personnel policies that attract quality people 
we also promote entrepreneurship among our employees by encouraging the exchange of ideas on providing new ways to meet customers ever changing needs 
one product that is currently being offered as a result of this company culture involves bringing storage to the customer through a containerized storage business 
another strategy is to make the process of renting storage more convenient by placing kiosks in local malls at which a customer may rent either a storage unit or a container 
as part of our focus on obtaining the highest quality products for our customers  we look for those storage centers that are located in well populated retail areas 
when entering a market  we seek dominant locations within specific three to five mile trade areas 
dominant locations refers to highly visible and accessible locations in retail corridors 
this kind of visibility creates customer awareness 
through multiple locations of this kind within a metropolitan area  we establish brand recognition as well as economies of scale in operations of our stores 
we seek to own at least stores in each of our markets in order to realize these efficiencies 
to further enhance brand recognition  we strive to achieve a uniform look to our properties 
this is accomplished through the use of signage  color schemes  quality of the building and our trademark lighthouse office design in new developments 
throughout the past three years  we have expanded our portfolio of real estate properties and real estate based investments through the use of equity and debt capital 
during  we acquired and developed domestic new centers directly or through joint ventures 
additionally  we acquired three storage centers in france  and opened two additional developments in belgium 
the following discussion of operations provides additional comparative financial information and discussion of each of the areas of growth  including internal or same store growth  direct acquisitions  domestic development  european operations  property management operations and other forms of real estate investments 
a discussion of capital expenditures  financing transactions and liquidity is also included 
when used in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the words believes  anticipates  projects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding financial performance 
actual results may differ materially due to uncertainties including the risk that competition from new self storage facilities or other storage alternatives may cause rent to decline and may cause occupancy rates to drop  tax law changes may change the taxability of future income  and litigation may materially decrease late fee revenue 
actual results may differ if increases in labor  taxes  marketing and other operating and construction expenses occur 
other factors which could affect our financial results are described below and in item business of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements are based on estimates as of the date of this report 
the company disclaims any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements reflecting new estimates  events or circumstances after the date of this report 
internal growth in  we continued our focus on increasing net operating income from our existing real estate assets 
one of the ways we analyze our performance is to measure year over year improvements in same store operating results 
we define same stores each quarter as those stabilized storage centers which were owned for the entire quarter of both comparison years 
thus  storage centers acquired in may of are included only in the third and fourth quarter same store comparison of versus and centers acquired in the third quarter of are only included in the fourth quarter same store comparison of versus annual same store data is the combination of same store data for each quarter 
other storage companies may define same stores differently  which will affect the comparability of the data

average annual rent per square foot is calculated by dividing actual rent collected by the average number of square feet occupied during the period 
as demonstrated by the operating information above  our same store net operating income is primarily driven by our ability to increase revenue while limiting expense increases 
various programs are utilized to obtain and keep storage customers in order to maximize property revenue 
providing the best customer service requires exceptional employees and on going quality training 
personnel are trained in all aspects of storage operations from operating the computer system and renting a unit to analyzing demand and pricing strategies 
they are also trained and authorized to make substantially all pricing and customer service decisions on site  with reference to our values and mission statement 
these training and personnel programs are continually evaluated and improved upon 
another revenue enhancing program currently utilized is the national call center which fields overflow calls from all the individual properties  providing personal service when on site employees are not available 
employees at the national call center are able to rent a unit at the store most convenient to the customer 
in  we implemented a new pricing strategy called revenue optimization 
historically  we have maintained a general policy on annual rent increases implemented toward the beginning of the year 
the revenue optimization program focuses on establishing product pricing in relationship to demand and closing ratios the percentage of prospects who subsequently rent a unit in order to maximize revenue 
the implementation of this new program took longer than expected and there were some additional training costs associated with implementing it 
as such  we did not fully realize the impact of this strategy until the fourth quarter of however  results reflect the benefits of this program 
net operating income has risen over the last three years due to increases in revenue  which are a function of changes in rental rates and occupancy 
while storage has a seasonal trend  spring and summer being peak occupancy periods  the cycle is annual and the revenue trend from to reflects general market changes 
revenue gains from to resulted entirely from rental rate increases  while gains from to resulted primarily from rate increases with slight occupancy improvements 
direct operating expenses were higher in than in due to a number of factors 
we experienced unusually high real estate assessment increases in  particularly in the denver market 
additionally  we expanded our yellow page advertising coverage in markets where we were developing  but  until the new developments opened in those areas  costs were allocated to the existing stores in that market 
training of field personnel for the revenue optimization program discussed above also impacted expenses 
despite these increases  direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained constant 
direct operating expenses rose only from to due to an extensive expense control focus by field personnel as well as decreases in yellow pages advertising 
increases were experienced primarily in personnel costs and real estate taxes 
we expect expense increases to be closer to in due to the tightening of certain labor markets and the effect of inflation on other general expenses 
we are aware of a purported class action lawsuit against a self storage operator alleging that late fees are unconscionably high which received national press attention 
while a lawsuit of this nature was filed against us in california on december   it was voluntarily dismissed on february  the plaintiff has the right to refile the lawsuit at anytime  and has indicated he intends to ask us to change our business practices regarding late fees in california 
our late fee revenue in california and other states could be negatively impacted if we were to change our practices

occupied to to to to to to arizona california florida illinois maryland michigan new york oregon texas virginia washington other weighted average we believe our diversified portfolio minimizes the impact of individual market fluctuations that result from economic or competitive changes within these markets 
in general  rental rate increases have driven the increase in revenue 
over the last three years  market conditions in san francisco  ca  chicago  il and seattle  wa contributed to above average revenue increases 
the completion of significant building improvements at our new york stores during and have improved our product quality and allowed our managers to increase rates beyond increases experienced in the prior year 
chicago and new york  in particular  demonstrate our use of revenue optimization  although occupancy declined in both markets  revenue rose well above average due to rate increases 
in  arizona experienced new competition in certain trade areas and a leveling off of demand which has affected rents in both and additionally  during  we vacated units at one store in order to convert the units to climate controlled space in anticipation of premium rents 
the conversion of these units was expected to be completed in late spring but due to unexpected delays was not finished until late august further decreasing occupancy in during  oregon experienced a drop in occupancy due to increased competition within three miles of certain stores  as well as some price sensitivity in the market 
revenue at one store declined  as a result of a fire during the third quarter and new competition 
a decline in the dallas  tx market was more than offset by gains in the houston  tx and san antonio  tx markets 
many of our older storage centers in the dallas  tx market are being impacted by new competitors entering their immediate trade area 
we expect to see some continued softening of rates and occupancy declines until this new supply is absorbed 
the san antonio  tx market declined in as new competition has forced rate decreases 
the stores in this market have stabilized and revenue has risen over the prior year 
our results in houston  tx were impacted by a fire in  revenue replacement insurance coverage expired and new market competition slowed the rent up of the reconstructed space 
our results show the recovery from this impact 
domestic acquisitions although availability of capital and competition has in many cases driven acquisition prices up  we have continued to selectively seek acquisition opportunities for high quality storage centers that meet our investment standards 
we have limited our efforts to pursue only those centers that enhance our existing network of stores ie establish greater market presence or expand an established market to create greater economies of scale and thus can be efficiently managed and operated 
in many cases  this has resulted in the purchase of properties we had previously managed for affiliated owners 
the acquisition of previously managed properties means the properties are in existing shurgard markets and we are familiar with the operating issues of those particular stores 
additionally  they usually have been maintained to our standards and as such do not have significant deferred maintenance costs 
the operating results of our acquisitions are presented in the tables below in order to show the impact of our operating strategies since the acquisition date

the evergreen partnership developed and owns seven self storage centers directly and  through a joint venture  owns an interest in an additional three centers

in addition to these major acquisitions  in we also acquired four self storage properties through individual purchases and one storage property through the merger with the management company 
these five storage centers  having a total of approximately  net rentable square feet of storage space  are located and were acquired as follows daly city  ca march  taylor  mi march  orland park  il may  puyallup  wa may and madison heights  mi june 
operating results for these acquisitions reflect the additional months of operations 
we previously managed all but two of these properties 
domestic development our long term growth plan includes significant development of new storage centers in markets in which we currently operate 
this is due to the increased competition for acquisitions in the storage market and our focus on maintaining high quality standards and consistent building design to develop brand awareness 
implementation of this development strategy is expected to continue through each development project progresses through a series of review processes from initial review  through due diligence  final review and finally to the land purchase and construction 
we believe the success of this strategy has been greatly enhanced as a result of the substantial experience we gained through the development of over one third of our properties 
we opened domestic storage centers in including seven through joint ventures and in including one through a joint venture 
seven of the projects opened in opened at the end of the fourth quarter and  as a result  did not have significant operations during the year

the average annual yield on the estimated total cost of these projects is projected at  assuming the projects are at occupancy at current rates 
based on the higher average rate we are receiving at our internally developed storage centers compared to our same store portfolio  we believe that customers have shown a willingness to pay more for newer storage facilities than older facilities 
future noi growth of older storage centers could be impacted by this trend 
there is of course no assurance that these projections regarding and development projects will occur 
assumed occupancy levels and rates could be impacted if we experience competition from other self storage properties and other storage alternatives in close proximity to our developments 
actual yields may also be lower if major expenses such as property taxes  labor  and marketing  among others  increase more than projected 
in addition to the above completed developments  we have storage centers currently under construction five of these are being developed in california  tennessee  florida and mississippi through joint ventures 
as a general rule  to limit the risks of development  we do not purchase land until the permitting process is complete 
construction usually begins shortly after we obtain title to the land 
the following table summarizes domestic development projects in progress at december  number of estimated completed projects cost of projects new domestic developments construction in progress million land purchased pending construction million expansion of existing properties opened during million construction in progress million in the current real estate environment  we believe that a long term strategy of growth through development will result in superior returns over the long term 
a development strategy  however  creates a short term dilution of earnings during the rent up phase of a project 
although certain costs  including real estate taxes and interest  are capitalized during the construction period  net operating income does not generally exceed interest expense on development projects for at least the first year of operations 
this rent up deficit for developments was  net operating income of  less interest on invested capital of  in compared to only  in the rent up deficit for a typical million project  assuming it takes months to rent up and is financed with debt at  is estimated to be approximately  in the first year of operations 
the amount of rent up deficit and the timing of positive cash flow cannot be predicted with certainty as it is based on a number of factors including length of rent up  ability to collect stated rental rates on leased units  actual operating expenses incurred  and the time of year a property opens 
another result of this rent up period is a decrease in our operating margins as new property expenses are added but the related revenue stream does not hit stabilized levels until occupancy reaches 
we currently anticipate opening to domestic developments in including the listed in the table above 
the actual number of projects could be reduced by zoning and permitting delays outside of our control  increased competition for sites  delays during construction caused by  among other things  weather  unforeseen site conditions  labor shortages  personnel turnover  scheduling problems with contractors  subcontractors or suppliers  or resource constraints 
we are currently in negotiations with an institutional investor to finance the first half of our development through an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
if such financing is completed  substantially all of the rent up deficit for the projects included in the financing will not adversely affect our net operating income 
we intend to pursue similar arrangements to finance some or all of the remaining and developments 
there is no assurance that this strategy will come to fruition as many factors will affect our ability to arrange off balance sheet financing 
these factors include our ability to find investors interested in financing the development under mutually agreeable financial and operating terms 
in addition to utilizing the experience of our in house real estate development personnel  in the past few years we have begun establishing relationships with quality storage operators outside our current markets 
we believe that the most efficient way to operate storage centers is to saturate a market thereby creating brand awareness and allowing certain economies of scale in operation processes and advertisement 
these relationships create instant presence in a new market as affiliate owned centers begin using the shurgard name 
in exchange for the use of our name  computer systems and general operations support services  the affiliate pays us an affiliation fee of of revenue 
additionally  these affiliation agreements provide the framework for the joint development of additional storage centers  allowing us to take advantage of the local operator s market knowledge 
we have signed three such affiliation agreements  which include a tennessee developer that opened three jointly developed centers in  one in  two in  and has one additional property under development and a florida developer that opened five jointly developed centers in and has 
one additional property under development 
a similar arrangement has been made with a california developer that began its first joint developments in and has two properties under construction 
however  this california developer does not have an existing presence in the market  and we will manage the properties on behalf of the joint venture

european operations during and  ssci invested million and million  respectively  in ssc benelux co  scs benelux scs  a belgian entity 
in march  ssci entered into a joint venture agreement with two unaffiliated entities to develop and acquire self storage centers in europe through a majority owned subsidiary 
as a result of this joint venture agreement  ssci owns direct and indirect interests totaling of benelux scs 
ssci  together with one of its partners  has the right to increase its participation in this joint venture joint venture through additional equity contributions 
through its entitlement to a majority of the seats on the benelux scs board  ssci retained its authority to direct the business affairs of benelux scs 
as a result of ssci s investment in europe  it faces certain risks inherent in international business operations  including currency risks  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potentially adverse tax burdens  obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash  and the burdens of complying with different permitting standards and a wide variety of foreign laws 
the self storage industry is not yet well established in much of europe  we believe this presents us the opportunity to become the dominant player 
currently  we are the only major us operator in europe 
benelux scs and its subsidiaries have established expansion plans that focus in four markets the benelux region  france  sweden and the uk 
during and  benelux scs developed four storage centers in belgium totaling  net rentable square feet 
during  benelux scs purchased three centers in france  two of which were newly built  totaling  net rentable square feet 
the three properties purchased in france were occupied at december  additionally during  benelux scs completed the construction of two more storage centers in belgium totaling  net rentable square feet when all phases are complete 
benelux scs and its subsidiaries currently have two additional stores under construction 
we anticipate adding five to eight additional european storage centers next year through both acquisition and development losses are expected to continue through the year as financing costs and overhead costs necessary to carry out current expansion plans exceed operating income  while the development stores go through rent up 
the construction and acquisition of storage centers during were funded through equity contributions from the joint venture and additional debt 
benelux scs debt is non recourse 
as a general partner  we are contingently liable for the debt of a joint venture  which at december  totaled million 
because of the newness of storage to the european market  the rent up period for storage centers has been substantially longer than that of domestic development projects 
management estimates that the first european sites may take two and a half to three years to reach a stabilized occupancy of approximately  but that future sites will  on average  rent up faster due to increased customer product awareness 
the three stores opened in belgium in had an average occupancy of at december   while the average of all six belgian centers at december  was 
during the rent up and initial product introduction period  rental rates are below those we anticipate at stabilization 
as each center reaches stabilized occupancy  management s focus will change from increasing occupancy to increasing rates 
the average rental rate for the four storage centers open at the end of increased  and we expect the increase to accelerate as we take advantage of the higher occupancies 
we believe that the average projected rates of for these four stores in are achievable as they are still substantially below rates currently being charged in the more established markets of london and paris 
new products and services we are continually exploring new ways to serve our customers storage needs 
one of the recent ways we have broadened our ability to meet customer needs is by bringing storage directly to the customer through containerized storage 
weatherized x x storage containers are delivered to customers for packing 
the containers are then picked up and delivered to a warehouse where they are stored 
customers may access their storage container in a showroom at the warehouse or have it redelivered to their home 
in addition to the monthly rental charge  service fees may be charged for pickup and delivery 
this business venture  which was initially tested in the seattle  wa market  is now operating in five major us markets  including seattle  wa  portland  or  san francisco  ca  atlanta  ga and chicago  il 
during  we do not intend to open any additional warehouses  but will concentrate on maximizing revenue growth through effective marketing and pricing strategies and optimizing our warehouse capacity and logistics 
in the seattle market  where we have been operating two warehouses for about ten months  we had containers rented at december  our realized rate in this market is now per container per month 
we have experienced minimal price sensitivity and will continue to adjust our rate structures to maximize revenue 
at december   we had invested million in this startup venture  shurgard storage to go  inc stg  with certain officers and key employees who had invested  and an unaffiliated third party who had invested million 
ssci owns only nonvoting stock in this start up venture which is not a qualified reit subsidiary and is subject to corporate level tax 
additionally  we have committed to invest an additional million during and lend million to fund negative cash flow during the rent up stage 
we also currently guarantee million in lease obligations 
in  our pro rata percentage of stg losses was million 
the loss for is expected to double  however  we expect to break even in the absence of losses from stg would positively affect our earnings in there is of course no assurance that stg will reach break even as projected as numerous factors affect profitability 
these factors include the possible inability to attract customers to use the product  the potential of new competition both containerized and other forms of storage entering our markets  and the possibility that customers may not be willing to pay the rates projected 
another way we are making storage more convenient for the customer is through the addition of shurgard storage stops in major malls 
these kiosks sales counters located in the center of malls are staffed with trained sales representatives who are available to answer questions about both self storage and containerized storage 
they have computer links to area storage centers through which they can give rate and availability information and lease units or containers to customers on the spot 
we now have six kiosks in three key markets and expect to add kiosks in two or three additional markets in in the first year of this new sales channel  we signed up over rentals generating revenue sufficient to cover the cost of the kiosks 
other real estate investments we have made several investments during the past three years through limited partnerships  joint ventures and participating mortgages 
during  we purchased from an unaffiliated third party  for million in cash  two limited partnership units in shurgard institutional fund lp ii  an affiliated partnership 
we now own units and are entitled to of limited partner distributions 
additionally  in  we purchased  from an unaffiliated third party  for million in cash  an additional three limited partnership units in shurgard institutional fund lp  an affiliated partnership 
we now own four units and are entitled to of this partnership s limited partner distributions 
we continue to own a general partnership interest in both these partnerships 
in  we made a tender offer for the limited partnership units in the ids partnerships 
on september   we purchased approximately  and of the outstanding limited partnership units of ids shurgard income growth partners lp  ids shurgard income growth partners lp ii  and ids shurgard income growth partners lp iii  respectively  for a total of million 
on november   we completed the acquisition by merging with the ids partnerships 
for the two months we owned the units of the ids partnerships in  earnings from this investment totaled million 
we have entered into seven joint ventures with a storage operator to develop seven properties in the nashville  tennessee metropolitan area and one in mississippi 
our economic interest in these joint ventures ranges from to 
we have guaranteed million of loans  our pro rata portion of the joint ventures debt 
additionally  we have guaranteed million of debt in joint ventures to develop six sites in orlando  florida under a similar arrangement 
we have a economic interest in these orlando joint ventures 
the financial results of these projects are not consolidated in our financial statements because the affiliation agreement allows the local operators to control the daily operations of the property and all significant investment decisions require the approval of both parties regardless of ownership percentage 
losses for these joint ventures totaled  in due to the addition of seven new properties during the year 
in  these joint ventures had earnings of  compared to a loss of  in funds from operations  as defined below  for these joint ventures totaled  in and  in compared to a negative  in see domestic development 
we have entered into an agreement with a third developer under which it will purchase sites in southern california and construct storage centers on them according to our specifications 
upon completion of the construction  we will manage the property for  in most cases  two years at which time the property will be contributed  subject to outstanding debt  into a newly formed corporation in which we will be the majority shareholder through the contribution of cash sufficient to pay development costs 
the developer s interest in the company will be based upon a predetermined formula and the current value of the property 
at december   we had guaranteed million in outstanding debt for two properties related to this agreement and will guarantee additional amounts as future properties are developed 
we have million invested in three participating mortgage loans 
all three mortgages are nonrecourse to the borrower and are secured by real estate  including four storage centers and office warehouse space 
the first two mortgages total million  bear interest at  and mature in december the third loan is for million  bears interest at  and matures in october additionally  we receive contingent interest payments from all the mortgaged properties equal to of both operating cash flow and distributions from the gain on sale of real property  as defined 
we have options to purchase the properties at established prices  generally exercisable in and extending until maturity of the loans 
other income and expenses interest expense increased million from to due to an increase in the outstanding debt balance 
this rise represents borrowings to purchase partnership units and to fund development of new storage centers and acquisitions 
additionally  during  we capitalized million in interest related to the construction of storage centers while million and million were capitalized in and  respectively 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  pursuant to the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit march   white paper on funds from operations  is defined as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of real estate  plus depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing costs 
contributions to ffo from unconsolidated entities in which the reporting entity holds an active interest are to be reflected in ffo on the same basis 
we believe ffo is meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net income because net income implicitly assumes that the value of assets diminish predictably over time while we believe that real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
ffo is not a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities or net income computed in accordance with gaap  nor should it be considered an alternative indication of our operating performance or liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define funds from operations in accordance with the nareit definition 
the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo in accordance with the nareit definition in thousands year ended december  net income before extraordinary item    preferred dividend  depreciation amortization    depreciation amortization from unconsolidated joints ventures and subsidiaries non recurring revenue expenses deferred financing costs    ffo    ffo for increased million over ffo which had risen million over as previously discussed  this growth rate reflects the improved performance of the original portfolio of properties as well as the addition of properties acquired over the three years 
we believe future growth rates will slow until development levels off  as the rent up period on development projects and start up losses on the containerized storage business partially offset operating results from current properties and acquisitions 
assuming we finance and development through off balance sheet agreements and stg reaches breakeven in as projected  we expect ffo to increase significantly in for a discussion of the factors that might cause these assumptions not to occur see domestic development and new products and services 
investing transactions during  we invested million in the acquisition of storage centers  million in domestic development and expansion projects  million in european development projects  and million in capital improvements to our existing portfolio 
the million increase in other real estate investments reflects primarily the million invested in the limited partnership units  the million invested in the florida joint ventures  the million invested in the tennessee joint ventures  and the million invested in shurgard storage to go  inc on september   pursuant to a tender offer  we purchased limited partnership units in the ids partnerships totaling million

capital expenditures in addition to continued investments in acquisitions and developments  we invest in improving our current portfolio of real estate 
investments in existing storage properties include primarily expansions  conversions ie  size of units or climate control and certain recurring improvements to roofs  pavement  sealant and other items such as security upgrades that we believe are necessary to maintain our quality standards and our ability to generate premium returns

specifically identified capital improvements expected for total to million  of which to million represent roofs  pavement and sealant

short term and long term liquidity cash balances remained stable from december  to december  as capital expenditures were funded primarily through cashflow  financing and equity transactions described above 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our liquidity and capital resources at december  debt to total assets total market capitalization  million  million million debt to total market capitalization weighted avg 
interest rate available lines of credit million million million total market capitalization is based on the closing market price of the class a stock and series b preferred stock multiplied by their respective total number of outstanding shares plus total debt 
our total debt at december  was million  of which million is fixed rate debt 
although we limit our use of variable rate debt  at times balances could be significant enough that fluctuations in interest rates may impact our earnings 
we believe that we will be able to minimize the impact of such rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate caps  refinancing or other strategies and that we will be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital to fund our growth plan in  make required principal payments and make distribution payments in accordance with reit requirements 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
reit qualification and distribution requirements as a reit  we are not required to pay federal income tax on annual taxable income that we currently distribute to our shareholders  provided that we distribute an amount equal to at least of our taxable income 
such distributions must be made in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before the reit timely files its tax return for such years and is paid on or before the first regular distribution payment date after such declaration 
our first distribution in was partially applied toward our distribution requirement 
similarly  our first distribution in was partially applied toward our distribution requirement 
in connection with the merger  the accumulated earnings and profits of the management company were carried over to the company for tax purposes 
in order to maintain our reit qualification  we were required to distribute to our shareholders in an amount necessary to eliminate such accumulated earnings and profits 
we did so through accelerating our normal fourth quarter distribution and declaring a special distribution of million in november as a result of these additional distributions  approximately of the distributions were return of capital for federal income tax purposes 
none of the distributions were return of capital while was return of capital in as a reit  we must derive at least of our total gross income from specified classes of income related to real property  distributions  interest or certain gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities 
our revenue from truck rentals  sales of locks and boxes and management services performed for other owners of properties do not qualify under this gross income test 
such nonqualifying income was approximately of gross revenue in and we expect to meet the test in our acquisition of additional properties will tend to reduce the percentage of nonqualifying income  while additional management contracts  including those with off balance sheet joint ventures and partnerships  and the sales of properties from the existing portfolio will tend to increase the percentage of nonqualifying income 
while we intend to manage our activities so that we continue to satisfy the test in the future  there can be no assurance that nonqualifying income will not exceed in future years
