item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in advent s annual report to stockholders 
in addition  advent operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond advent s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
period to period fluctuations 
as advent s licenses into multi user networked environments have increased both in individual size and number  the timing and size of individual license transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in advent s quarterly operating results 
the sales cycles for transactions of this size are often lengthy and unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that advent will be successful in closing large license transactions such as these on a timely basis or at all 
accordingly  if in the future revenues from large site licenses constitute a material portion of advent s net revenues  the timing of such licenses could cause additional variability in advent s quarterly operating results 
advent s software products typically are shipped shortly after receipt of a signed license agreement and initial payment and  consequently  software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
advent s expense levels are based in significant part on advent s expectations of future revenues and therefore are relatively fixed in the short term 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved by advent on products and services  an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter is likely to disproportionately adversely affect operating results 
advent generally has realized lower revenues from license fees in the first quarter of the year than in the immediately preceding quarter 
advent believes that this has been due primarily to the concentration by some clients of larger capital purchases in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and their lower purchasing activity during the subsequent first quarter  compounded by advent s annual incentive compensation plans which result in increased year end sales activity 
furthermore  advent has often recognized a substantial portion of its license revenues in the last month of a quarter 
due to all of the foregoing factors  advent believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
advent s stock price has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering in november like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector  advent s stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations 
if net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on advent s stock price 
in addition  the stock price may be affected by broader market trends unrelated to advent s performance product concentration 
during  and  advent derived a substantial majority of its net revenues from the licensing of axys and related products and services 
in addition  many of advent s other products  such as moxy  qube and various data interfaces  were designed to operate with axys to provide an integrated solution 
as a result  advent believes that a majority of its net revenues  at least through  will be dependent upon continued market acceptance of axys  enhancements or upgrades to axys and related products and services 
geneva 
in  advent introduced geneva to target organizations with complex international accounting and reporting requirements  and  in  announced its full commercial availability 
to date  revenues derived from licenses of geneva have not been material 
advent is directing a significant amount of its product development expenditures to the on going development of geneva and plans to devote a significant amount of its future sales and marketing resources to geneva 
advent has limited experience in developing products for this market 
because of such limited client experience  there can be no assurance that geneva will not require substantial software enhancements or modifications to satisfy performance requirements of clients or to fix design defects or previously undetected errors 
further  there can be no assurance that advent will be successful in marketing geneva 
advent s failure to successfully market geneva could adversely affect advent s business and operating results 
internet initiative 
to take advantage of the internet  advent has launched an internet initiative whereby it is developing services  both announced and unannounced  to bring internet based products and services to clients 
the first of these services  rex  was launched during the second quarter of as advent begins development of new products and services under its internet initiative  it has and will continue to enter into development agreements with information providers  clients  or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services 
there can be no assurance that advent will be successful in marketing rex or in developing other internet services 
advent s failure to do so could adversely affect advent s business and operating results 
new products and product enhancements 
advent s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to emerging industry standards and practices 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
in addition  advent s ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors  including certain system software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  database vendors and development tool vendors 
in the event that the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws  or if such products are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction  advent s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
financial markets 
the target clients for advent s products include a range of organizations that manage investment portfolios  including investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks and hedge funds 
in addition  advent targets corporations  public funds  universities and non profit organizations which also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs 
the success of many of advent s clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
advent believes that demand for its products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products relationship with interactive data 
many of advent s clients use advent s proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from interactive data 
interactive data pays advent a commission based on interactive data s revenues from providing such data to advent s clients 
advent s software products have been customized to be compatible with interactive data s system and such software would need to be redesigned if interactive data s services were unavailable for any reason 
in the event that advent s relationship with interactive data were terminated or interactive data s services were unavailable to advent s clients for any reason  replacing these services could be costly and time consuming 
competition 
the market for investment management software is segmented by the relative size of the organizations that manage investment portfolios 
in addition  the market in each segment is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
advent s competitors include providers of software and related services as well as providers of timeshare services 
competitors vary in size  scope of services offered and platforms supported 
in addition  advent competes indirectly with existing and potential clients  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors such as advent 
many of advent s competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than advent 
there can be no assurance that advent will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially adversely affect advent s business  operating results and financial condition
