working capital increased  to  in fiscal compared to a  increase in and a  increase in investing activities increased  consisting of  for the continued purchase of computer hardware and software compared to  in financing activities included a  net decrease in short term borrowing due to the previously mentioned improved cash flow from operating activities 
capital resources available to the company include an existing line of credit for working capital 
the current line is a maximum of million based on accounts receivable and work in progress  of which approximately  is currently available 
an agreement was signed this year which reduced the borrowing rate to the bank s base rate and reduced the amount charged for letters of credit 
the line of credit is also a demand note and requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
to date  the company has maintained these covenants and believes that its working capital and existing line of credit are adequate to meet current fiscal year requirements 
the company is planning to continue its program of purchasing computer assisted design and drafting equipment 
in the long term  the company relies on the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund investing and financing requirements 
the company is currently involved in two lawsuits  skinner and american continental properties 
if the outcome of these lawsuits is adverse  the company may be required to pay substantial deductibles or indemnification see note 
the company believes that it will be able to finance any adverse finding through the use of an income tax carryback of the resulting loss in combination with the line of credit and existing resources 
the company is vigorously pursuing its defenses  and management believes the final resolution of these legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
year the year issue  or the yk bug as it is sometimes called  is the result of computer programs and equipment that were written and manufactured using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
date sensitive computer programs and equipment may recognize a date using only the last two digits 
this could result in the year being recognized as the year system failures or miscalculations can occur  which would cause disruptions in operations and or the inability to process normal business transactions 
stv has recently acquired new financial and project management systems that are certified year compliant 
the company is also continuing on a normal basis to replace or upgrade other systems that may not be compliant 
this process will be completed in costs of becoming compliant will not be materially more than normal information technology it purchases and associated it costs 
however  stv has taken and will continue to take reasonable and prudent actions  consistent with the standards of care prevalent in the industry  to comply with year standards and to prevent interruptions to stv operations 
the company is taking action to obtain certification from its suppliers  including suppliers of it and non it systems  and its clients of their year compliance  and to test the company s existing equipment and software under simulated year conditions to further ensure that normal operation will continue beyond a steering committee of senior managers has been formed to coordinate and manage all year issues  both internally and externally 
the cost of this endeavor is not believed to be material 
the maximum potential risk exposure to stv is as follows a disruptions could occur with the failure of project specific applications or unique computer assisted design and drafting and other software products that are not compliant 
this would halt or delay completion of engineering or construction designs and could subject stv to litigation for failure to complete designs according to contract timetables  and b there is the potential for a governmental unit or other large client to have compliance problems in remitting to the company or otherwise interrupting collections or bank processes 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company currently has a contingency plan to immediately replace any defective computer or software system 
this plan is considered adequate because all stv systems are pc based  and stv has sufficient hardware and financial assets to make such corrections on a near real time basis 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements certain oral statements made by management from time to time and certain statements contained herein  such as statements regarding stv s ability to meet its liquidity needs and control costs  certain statements in notes to consolidated financial statements  and other statements contained herein regarding matters which are not historical facts are forward looking statements as such term is defined in the securities act of 
because such statements involve risks and uncertainties  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to those discussed below the company s ability to secure the capital and the related cost of such capital necessary to fund its future growth 
stv s continued ability to operate in a heavily regulated government environment 
the company s government contracts are subject to termination  reduction or modification as a result of changes in the government s requirements or budgetary restrictions 
under certain circumstances  the government can also suspend or debar individuals or firms from obtaining future contracts with the government 
the level of competition in the company s industry  including companies with significantly larger operations and resources than stv 
the company s ability to identify and win suitable projects and to consummate or complete any such projects 
stv s ability to perform design build projects  which may include the responsibility of ensuring the actual construction of a project for a guaranteed price 
impact of inflation because the company s business is essentially the supplying to customers of the expertise of its employees  there are certain factors which significantly reduce the impact of inflation 
one such factor is that the company has a comparatively small investment in property and equipment as a percentage of total assets 
in addition  a substantial percentage of the company s contracts are under cost reimbursement contract provision or fixed price contracts which include inflation assumptions when bid upon
