item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company opened its first store in december in atlanta 
this store received a strong response in the atlanta market  and in fiscal  k g focused on opening additional stores outside atlanta with co investors 
these co investors typically contributed up to of the initial capital investment for the store and served as store managers 
k g opened seven such stores from fiscal through the beginning of fiscal in fiscal  the company re examined its expansion strategy and decided not to open stores with co investors in the future 
accordingly  k g delayed new store openings until it could complete preparations for future store expansion 
also in fiscal  the company acquired the interests of certain co investors 
there are now only two stores located in cincinnati and indianapolis not wholly owned by the company  and k g holds majority interests in both of these stores 
since october  the company has opened stores  increasing its store base by over to locations 
the stores included two stores each in the boston  philadelphia  long island  houston and washington  dc areas and stores in atlanta  baltimore  cleveland  minneapolis  seattle  dallas ft 
worth  charlotte  kansas city  kansas  fairfield  new jersey and columbus  ohio 
the company intends to open seven more stores in fiscal year  for a total of new stores for the fiscal year 
the company has experienced a compounded annual growth rate in net sales since  with comparable store sales increases every year since inception 
management believes that a significant portion of the company s comparable store sales increases are due to word of mouth publicity provided by its customers  which is supported by local advertising 
the following table sets forth certain operating statistics for the company since fiscal dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales        comparable store sales increase number of stores at end of period in fiscal  the company opened a second store in atlanta  which had the effect of reducing comparable store sales growth at k g s original atlanta store

as the company expands  it will continue its strategy of offering everyday low prices  which results in the company having a lower gross margin and a higher inventory turnover than many of its competitors 
k g also plans to maintain its position as a low cost provider of men s apparel through continued control of store and corporate expenses 
the company intends to open stores in fiscal  and to new stores in fiscal given the company s expansion  the company s store base will include a relatively high proportion of younger stores  which have yet to reach maturity 
the company s more mature stores historically have produced higher sales per square foot and higher operating margins than its younger stores 
k g s planned expansion is expected to produce a decrease in the company s overall sales per square foot and operating margins 
increases in the level of advertising and pre opening expenses associated with the opening of new stores may also contribute to a decrease in the company s operating margins 
finally  opening new stores in existing markets may also reduce sales of existing stores in those markets

such forward looking statements are typically identified by statements to the effect that the company believes  estimates  intends  expects or anticipates a certain state of affairs 
with respect to such forward looking statements  the company seeks the protections afforded by the private securities litigation reform act of the list set forth below is intended to identify certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements included elsewhere herein 
these factors are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business  and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements included elsewhere herein 
small store base 
the company has a relatively limited history of opening and operating stores  and also has previously closed two stores 
moreover  the company s operating profits have historically been disproportionately generated by stores that have been operating for longer periods of time 
due to these factors  the results achieved to date by the company s relatively small store base may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved from a larger number of stores 
expansion 
the company s future operating results will depend largely upon its ability to open and operate new stores successfully and to manage a larger business profitably 
the success of k g s planned expansion strategy is dependent upon many factors  including identifying suitable markets and sites for new stores 
in addition  the company must be able to continue to hire  train and retain competent managers and store personnel 
the failure of the company to achieve its expansion goals on a timely basis  obtain acceptance in markets in which it currently has limited or no presence and operate these stores on a profitable basis  attract and retain qualified management and other personnel  appropriately upgrade its systems and controls or manage operating expenses could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
merchandise and market trends 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner 
if the company miscalculates either the market for the merchandise in its stores or its customers purchasing habits  it may be required to sell a significant amount of inventory at below average mark ups over the company s cost  or below cost  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
vendor relationships 
the company s business is dependent upon its ability to purchase first quality  current season  brand name and private label merchandise at competitive prices 
a disruption of vendor relationships could adversely affect the company s business
