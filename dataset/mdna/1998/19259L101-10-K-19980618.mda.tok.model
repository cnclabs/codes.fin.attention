ebitda represents earnings from continuing operations before deductions for interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is used by management and certain investors as an indicator of a company s historical ability to service debt 
management believes that an increase in ebitda is an indication of a company s improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
however  ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the period  nor has it been presented as an alternative to either a operating income as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or b cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity

the company has guaranteed the indebtedness under the amended and restated credit facility and pledged to bankers trust company  as collateral agent  its interests in all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the company 
subject to the terms and conditions of the amended and restated credit facility  the company may  at its option  convert base rate loans as defined in the amended and restated credit facility into eurodollar loans as defined in the amended and restated credit facility

operating and investing activities the company s level of indebtedness will have several important effects on its future operations including  but not limited to  the following i a significant portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be required to pay interest on its indebtedness  ii the financial covenants contained in certain of the agreements governing the company s indebtedness will require the company to meet certain financial tests and may limit its ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  iii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  and iv the company s ability to adapt to changes in the outsourced laundry equipment services industry and to economic conditions in general could be limited 
as the company has focused on increasing its cash flow from operating activities  it has made significant capital investments  primarily consisting of capital expenditures related to acquisitions  renewals and growth 
the company anticipates that it will continue to utilize cash flows from operations to finance its capital expenditures and working capital needs  including interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year were approximately million including approximately million promissory note in connection with the acquisition of a small route operator and approximately million relating to capital lease obligations 
of such amount  the company spent approximately million in acquisition and related transaction costs  primarily the macke acquisition  the reliable acquisition  the ali acquisition and the national coin acquisition  and approximately million related to the net increase in the installed base of machines of  machines 
the balance of approximately million was used to maintain the existing machine base which consist of machine expenditures  advance location payments and laundry room improvements in current locations and the replacement of discontinued locations and for general corporate purposes 
the full impact on revenues and cash flow generated from capital expended on acquisitions and the net increase in the installed based are not expected to be reflected in the company s financial results until subsequent reporting periods  depending on the timing of the capital expended 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions and internal growth  will be approximately million for the twelve months ending march  such increase relative to fiscal is primarily attributable to the company s recent acquisition activities 
while the company estimates that it will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to finance anticipated capital expenditures  there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so 
the company s working capital requirements are  and are expected to continue to be  minimal since a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are not paid until after cash is collected from the installed machines 
in connection with certain of the financing agreements governing the company s indebtedness  the company is required to make monthly cash interest payments as required by the amended and restated credit facility and semi annual cash interest payments as required by the senior notes 
management believes that the company s future operating activities will generate sufficient cash flow to repay indebtedness outstanding under the senior notes and borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility or to permit any necessary refinancings thereof 
an inability of the company  however  to comply with covenants or other conditions contained in the indentures governing the senior notes or in the credit agreement evidencing the amended and restated credit facility could result in an acceleration of all amounts due under such indentures and the amended and restated credit facility 
if the company is unable to meet its debt service obligations  it could be required to take certain actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness  selling additional equity capital or other actions 
there is no assurance that any of such actions could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or on terms permitted under the amended and restated credit facility  or the indentures governing the senior notes 
certain accounting treatment the company s depreciation and amortization expenses  aggregating approximately million for the fiscal year  have the effect of reducing net income but not operating cash flow 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  a significant amount of the purchase price of businesses acquired by the company is allocated to contract rights  which costs are amortized over periods of up to years 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year during the fiscal year  the company determined that it needed to modify significant portions of its software so that its information systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also has initiated discussions with its significant suppliers  customers  and financial institutions to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to properly remediate their computer systems 
the company s comprehensive year initiative is being managed by a team of internal and external staff 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and that transactions with customers  suppliers  and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company anticipates its information systems transformation for year compliance will be completed in the fall of while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that its computer systems or the computer systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the operations of the company 
the cost of the year initiative is not expected to be material to the company s results of operation or financial condition 
inflation and seasonality in general  the company s laundry operating expenses and general and administrative expenses are affected by inflation  and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the company in future periods 
management believes that such effects have not been nor will be material to the company 
the company s business generally is not seasonal
