item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation 
the following is management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and the historical financial condition of united financial corp 
and united bank 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of the results of operations and financial condition of united financial corp 
and united bank 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under part i  item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which involve risks and uncertainties 
united financial corp 
s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  competition in the geographic and business areas in which united financial corp 
conducts its operations  fluctuations interest rates  credit quality and government regulations 
changes in financial condition during during  total assets decreased million  or  to million 
the primary reason for this change was a million  or  net deposit outflow  with deposits of million at the end of the deposit outflow was funded primarily from a million  or  decrease in investment securities 
loans receivable increased million  or  to million  and cash and cash equivalents declined million  or  to million 
stockholders equity increased 
million to million 
united bank experienced a net decrease in deposits of million for the year ended december   a net increase in deposits of 
million for the year ended december   and a net decrease of million for the year ended december  the outflow was a result of several factors 
first  united bank has traditionally offered a limited array of loan and deposit products in its role as a traditional thrift 
this limited selection of products has required that customers go to other financial institutions or other alternate sources for a wider selection of products to meet their financial needs 
with the merger  united bank now offers more varied financial products and is attempting to keep its customers from migrating to competitors 
secondly  due to the limited loan products offered by united bank in the past  its need for loan funding dictated interest rates on its deposit products be less than competitive 
management is taking steps to prevent further deposit outflows while recognizing the need to price its products competitively 
the 
million increase in stockholders equity was comprised of million of net income  less million of cash dividends paid to shareholders and a less than 
million improvement in the unrealized loss adjustment for available for sale investment securities 
stockholders equity at december  was of assets and book value was per share 
total loan production was million  a million  or  decrease compared to forty one percent  or million  of the total loan production was comprised of long term fixed rate mortgage loans originated for sale to the secondary market 
the following table summarizes the major components of the company s net income for each of the three years ended december   as well as the changes which occurred between the periods shown

net income for was  a  or  increase over the primary reasons for this change were a  increase in net interest income and the one time  fdic saif deposit insurance special assessment 
these two positive changes were partially offset by a  loan loss reserve provision and a  reduction in non interest income due primarily to a gain from the sale of investment securities

this category decreased  or  to  the primary reason for this decline was  in gains from the sale of available for sale investment securities 
loan fees and discount income remained approximately the same   in  compared to  in during loans originated for sale to the secondary market were million  compared to million in  while loans originated for portfolio were million  compared to million in non interest expense 
this category decreased  or  to  the primary reason for this decrease was the  fdic saif deposit insurance premium previously discussed 
the after tax impact of this one time special assessment was a  or a 
per share  reduction in net income 
compared to the prior year  salaries and employees benefits were  higher 
this increase was due primarily to salary increases  the employment of two experienced agricultural and commercial loan officers and additional expenses resulting from termination of united bank s savings association retirement fund 
due to a decrease in both deposit balances and fdic saif insurance rates  regular fdic saif insurance premium expense declined  or  from  in to  in other expenses declined  or over  to  due primarily to a  or  decrease in advertising related expenses  from  in to  in and a  loss on the sale of real estate owned 
provision for income taxes 
income before taxes in was  a  or  improvement compared to total income taxes were  a  or  increase compared to for both and the company incurred the federal corporate tax rate and a montana corporate license tax 
provision for losses on loans and asset quality 
the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs to bring the allowance to a level considered adequate to absorb losses inherit in the loan portfolio 
united bank provided  for loan losses in  bringing the total reserve to  at december  compared to  at december  there were no loan charge offs in non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  accruing loans past due over days  restructured loans  other repossessed assets and real estate owned held for sale reo hfs were  at december  and  at december   representing 
and 
of total assets  respectively 
the loan loss reserve as a percentage of nonperforming assets at december  and december  were and  respectively 
united bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
at december  and 
at december  united bank has recently embarked on a growth orientated expansion strategy  which has already resulted in an increase and a change in its traditional loan portfolio 
this strategy reflects the beginning of a transition from a traditional thrift to activities resembling those of a commercial bank 
this business strategy is subject to greater risk  including the increased risk of losses on loans 
in  united bank has hired two experienced montana agricultural and commercial lenders to originate agricultural and commercial loans for united bank s portfolio 
in addition  united bank is purchasing lease financing and commercial loan participations originated out of united bank s market area 
these loans have different risks in terms of loan monitoring and higher exposure due to economic conditions and markets outside of united bank s traditional market area 
united bank s market area is concentrated in montana  increasing its exposure to loan losses from a deterioration in economic conditions in this state 
montana has experienced a decline in consumer credit quality consistent with that experienced on a national level 
the filings of personal bankruptcies in montana have increased in recent years 
based on the average for all insured commercial banks in montana  the net loss to average total loans increased in and increased nearly in the average loan loss reserve for montana commercial banks at december  and december  was and of total loans  respectively 
the initial growth and ongoing change in united bank s loan portfolio  combined with the apparent deterioration and economic trends both on a national and a montana state wide basis and deficiencies in united bank s loan loss reserve coverage compared to state wide averages  resulted in management s addition to the loan loss reserve in united bank s portfolio is and will in future periods continue to be exposed to greater risk than has historically been experienced with a portfolio comprised primarily of secured residential loans 
additional provisions to the loan loss reserve and future charge offs can be expected to occur 
comparison of years ended december  and december  general 
net income for was  a  or  decrease compared to the primary reasons for this decline were a  fdic saif deposit insurance special assessment  a  decline in net interest income resulting primarily from higher deposit costs and borrowing expense  and higher other expenses due to  of advertising expense 
net interest margin net interest income divided by average interest earning assets declined basis points to 
net interest spread the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets less the average cost of interest bearing liabilities declined basis points to

average interest earning assets declined million  or  to million 
average loans receivable increased million  or  to million  and average other interest earning assets declined million to million 
loans receivable average yields decreased basis points to and overall lower yields on all other interest earning assets resulted in a average yield for all interest earning assets of  compared to in interest expense 
average deposits decreased million  or  to million 
the mix of average deposits changed with average lower cost statement savings decreasing million  or  while higher cost repricing average time deposits increased million  or 
the cost of average time deposits increased basis points to 
the average cost of deposits rose to  compared to in deposit interest expense in therefore increased  or  to  primarily due to million dollars of fhlb advances outstanding at the end of  average borrowings were million  a million increase over  resulting in  of interest expense in  compared to  in the average cost of borrowings was  compared to in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities increased to  compared to in net interest income 
this category decreased  or  to  for the reasons cited above 
non interest income 
this category increased  or  to  the primary reason for this increase was  in gains from sales of available for sale investment securities 
in  loan origination fee and discount income increased  or  to  this improvement was the direct result of increased loan production 
during loans originated for sale to the secondary market were million  compared to million in  and loans originated for portfolio in were million  compared to million in non interest expense 
this category increased  or  to  the primary reason for this increase was the  fdic saif deposit insurance premium previously discussed 
the after tax impact of this special assessment was a  or a cent per share  reduction in net income 
other expenses increased  or  to  due primarily to a  or an increase in advertising related expenses  from  in to  in and a  loss on the sale of real estate owned 
provision for income taxes 
income before taxes in was  a  or  reduction from total income taxes were  a  or  decrease compared to this disproportionate decrease in taxes  compared to the pre tax earnings decrease  was due primarily to the federal statutory bad debt deduction which was repealed in this bad debt deduction reduced federal income taxes by approximately  for and  the company incurred the marginal montana corporate license tax 
fdic saif insurance legislation enacted into law in was legislation providing for a special assessment against fdic saif member institutions  which capitalized the saif insurance reserve to the prescribed of insured deposits level 
for united bank  this one time special assessment was  or basis points per of united bank s insured deposit base on march  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the expense and payment of this  special assessment 
based upon united bank s a fdic risk classification  united bank s fdic saif assessment rate  beginning january   decreased from basis points to basis points per of insured deposits 
most commercial banks insured under the fdic bank insurance fund bif  beginning january   were assessed basis points per of insured deposits 
for the second half of  united bank s fdic saif assessment rate was basis points per of insured deposits  while bif members began paying basis points 
legislation regulatory and legislative changes continue to have a dramatic effect on united bank and all other federally regulated depository institutions 
regulatory agencies have become more aggressive in their oversight role and have been implementing a get tough approach to compliance examinations and fair lending law interpretation and enforcement 
the current administration is focusing on consumer compliance issues  in particular fair lending  while congress continues to focus on areas that pose potential safety and soundness problems 
it is doubtful that the complexity of the laws  regulations and guidelines facing united bank  and all other federally regulated depository institutions  will materially abate in the near future 
their impact on united bank has become clear 
united bank will continue to be burdened with regulatory compliance issues that add to united bank s costs of operations  while at the same time providing certain distinct competitive advantages to nonregulated competitors 
now being debated in the us congress and senate are several banking and financial modernization bills that include such issues as thrift and thrift holding company charter changes  conversion of thrifts to national bank charter status  changes in bank holding company powers  merger of the bif and saif fdic insurance funds  consolidation of federal regulatory agencies  modernization of the fhlb  branch banking and several other consumer and regulatory issues 
what final form  and impact  this type of legislation and other potential changes in federal law regarding interstate banking and branching  glass stegall act revisions  the continued consolidation of the banking industry and other regulatory changes will have on united bank s operations cannot be predicted at this time 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with computer systems as the year approaches 
the company recognizes the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by year date related failures 
the company has provided its business customers  suppliers and vendors with information regarding the company s progress on year issues and has requested similar information in return 
all software currently used within the company is supplied by vendors 
the data center operations of united financial will be converted to heritage bank s data processing center  which is anticipated to be completed by june  heritage has been advised by their data processing provider that a new generation of software  to be implemented by early  will be year certified 
the company continues to bear some risk related to the year issue and could be adversely affected if other entities not affiliated with the company do not appropriately address their own year compliance issues 
based on the study and analysis conducted  the dollar amount required to remediate the known year issues is not expected to be material to the company s business 
unanticipated problems or difficulties  however  could significantly increase the company s estimated expenditures for the year project 
asset liability management united bank s earnings depend to a large extent on the level of its net interest income 
net interest income depends upon the difference referred to as interest rate spread between the yield on united bank s loan and investment portfolios and interest earning cash balances interest earning assets  and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is further affected by the relative amounts of united bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
when the amount of interest earning assets is less than the amount of interest bearing liabilities  the net yield on interest earning assets is less than the interest rate spread 
should this difference in amounts become too great  united bank could incur a net interest expense despite a positive spread 
one of the primary objectives of united bank s management over the past several years has been to restructure united bank s balance sheet to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates interest rate risk 
savings institutions historically have suffered from a mismatch in the term to maturity of their assets and liabilities  with mortgage loan assets tending to be of a much longer term than deposits  the primary liabilities of savings institutions 
in periods of rising interest rates  this mismatch can render savings institutions vulnerable to increases in costs of funds deposits and borrowings that can outstrip increases in returns on longer term fixed rate loans and investments  resulting in a decrease in positive interest rate spread and lower earnings 
several strategies have been employed by united bank to minimize the mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
for the past several years  united bank has maintained the policy of selling all newly originated long term to year maturity fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
these loans are sold at their outstanding principal balance  which is the prearranged contract purchase price  and therefore  no gain or loss is realized at sale 
united bank promotes the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions 
united bank also emphasizes investment in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
liquidity not utilized for retained loan production has resulted  over the past several years  in an increase in the relative percentage to total assets of shorter term investments versus longer term loans 
in the very low market interest rate and flat yield curve environment of the past few years  no real opportunity existed to extend loan portfolio or investment maturity purchases for a higher yield 
longer term to year fixed rate mortgage loan retention  or greater than year to maturity investment purchases would have provided only a marginal increase in interest income while exposing united bank to significant declines in market values if interest rates rose substantially 
starting in  united bank began retaining selected portfolio loans for higher earnings by engaging in increased multi family and commercial real estate lending  as well as increased non mortgage commercial and consumer lending 
multi family  all commercial real estate lending and commercial and consumer non mortgage lending is generally shorter term in nature than single family residential lending and  although typically fixed rate  bears higher interest rates 
while united bank believes that its ongoing asset liability management strategies have reduced exposure to interest rate risk  future earnings and stockholders equity will continue to be influenced by changes in levels of market interest rates  competition  and other economic factors beyond the control of united bank s management 
management believes that its conservative short term maturity and adjustable rate investment and loan portfolio policies  enable united bank to minimize portfolio market value declines  and maintain earnings  while providing the liquidity to reprice assets to offset higher market interest rates and increased deposit costs

as of december  and december   united bank s liquidity ratios were and  respectively 
eliminated in was a separate rule requiring united bank to maintain a short term liquid assets ratio equal to at least of its liquidity base in cash or short term liquid assets 
during the fiscal years and  united bank consistently maintained liquidity ratios far in excess of regulatory requirements 
united bank s liquidity investments for regulatory purposes were approximately million at december   and consisted primarily of cash  interest earning bank accounts  fhlb certificates of deposit  and us government agencies 
united bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  proceeds from loan sales  investment securities interest payments and maturities  and net operating revenues 
the principal uses of funds are loan originations  mortgage backed securities and other investment securities purchases  maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals  repayment of fhlb borrowings  cash dividends  maintaining liquidity and meeting operating expenses 
as demonstrated by the statement of cash flows  million of cash provided by operating activities and million of net cash provided by investing activities were utilized to fund a million decrease in deposits and pay million of cash dividends to shareholders 
during  unlike  the company experienced deposits as a use  rather than a source of funds 
united bank can borrow from the fhlb in an amount not to exceed of assets 
the company currently has no material commitments for loan fundings or other expenditures 
at december   the company s stockholders equity was approximately million  or over of assets 
additionally  united bank s regulatory capital is over million more than the highest of three regulatory capital standards required by federal regulations 
the company s current level of capital and liquidity provides it with the opportunity to manage its balance sheet with a great deal of flexibility while still complying with regulatory requirements 
management believes that the present facilities and equipment required to conduct its business are adequate for the immediate future 
management will review facility needs in conjunction with the merger with heritage bancorporation 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historic dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
since the company s earnings depend on its level of interest rate spread the difference between the yield on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  its primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk irr 
interest rate risk 
the company has established a formal written board of director s approved irr policy 
the banks have also established an asset liability management committee and an investment committee  which meets at least quarterly to review and report in writing to the banks board of directors management s efforts to minimize irr 
several asset liability management strategies have been employed by the company to minimize its exposure to irr these include selling all newly originated long term fixed rate mortgages  promoting the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions and investing in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
interest rate risk sensitivity of net portfolio value npv measurement seeks to establish a methodology to measure the potential for the reduction of earnings and stockholders equity resulting from both lower net interest income nii and lower npv caused by changes in market interest rates 
npv thus provides a leading indicator of future potential changes in both nii and stockholders equity 
because if their asset size less than million  the banks fall under an ots exemption that allows utilization of an asset liability computer simulation program prepared and distributed by the ots 
the ots thrift financial report includes schedule cmr that provides detailed information about the balances  interest rates  repricing  and maturity characteristics of the banks financial instruments 
by utilizing the banks provided schedule cmr data  the ots runs computer simulations net portfolio value model utilizing ots assumptions 
the banks board of directors  per ots requirements  has established maximum percentage changes  or policy limits for npv of per instantaneous basis point change in rates 
the following table demonstrates united bank s december  npv and the present value of total assets  npv ratio  and basis point change for four instantaneous increases and the four instantaneous decreases in interest rates dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv npv as of pv of assets instantaneous change pv of npv in rates amount change change total assets ratio change bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp   bp bp   bp bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operation results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cashflows  and others 
sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the company might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
