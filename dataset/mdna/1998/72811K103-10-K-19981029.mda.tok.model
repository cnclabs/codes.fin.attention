the shares of common stock had a fair market value of  at the date of acquisition 
the company incurred  in costs directly related to the acquisition 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method 
net toy sales to amusement customers accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal the company sells both licensed and non licensed products to its amusement customers for use principally as redemption prizes 
except for television promoted retail products  sales to amusement customers generally result in higher gross margins than sales to retail customers  with gross margins from the sale of licensed products to amusement customers generally exceeding those of non licensed products 
net toy sales to retail customers accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal since the beginning of fiscal  the company has expanded its product offering of licensed stuffed toys through the addition of several licensed characters and trademarks 
prior to fiscal  substantially all of the company s sales to retail customers involved licensed products 
during fiscal  of retail sales were from non licensed goods consisting principally of the talkin tots tm 
in fiscal  the company experienced larger percentage increases in sales to retail customers than to amusement customers 
based on the current weakness in the domestic retail toy market  the company does not expect the growth in the retail division s sales to continue at rates as rapid as it has experienced in the past years 
due to the higher volume purchasing power enjoyed by many of the larger retail customers  sales to retail customers typically involve larger dollar amounts but lower gross margins than the company s sales to amusement customers 
the television promoted products have a higher gross profit margin that is offset by the associated advertising cost  which is reported as a component of selling  general and administrative costs 
the company incurred approximately million of media advertising cost in fiscal and expects to incur an additional million during the first two fiscal quarters of the company began its international toy operations with the opening of its distribution facility in spain in august since that time  the company has experienced significant sales growth in its international operations  particularly in western europe 
european toy operations accounted for of net sales and of consolidated operating income for fiscal the company anticipates continued growth in international sales to both the amusement and retail markets  including continued growth in sales of licensed products 
the company generally sells the same non licensed products in europe as in the united states 
the company sells certain licensed products exclusively in certain international countries while others are sold both domestically and internationally 
the company s european toy sales have generally resulted in higher gross margins than domestic toy sales  and the company believes this trend will continue 
the company s international toy sales are made primarily to european countries by play by play espana  sa located in valencia  spain and by play by play  uk located in doncaster  england 
to date  the cost of most direct shipment sales from third party manufacturers to international customers have been made by play by play espana and have been denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the shipment date until receipt of payment 
substantially all other sales by such subsidiary are transacted in spanish pesetas british pounds  the functional currencies  and therefore any gain or loss on currency translation is reported as a component of shareholders equity on the consolidated financial statements 
when the company s subsidiaries purchase inventory from suppliers in the far east  all such purchases are made in united states dollars and the company experiences currency risk to the extent that the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the spanish peseta british pound fluctuate from the date play by play europe is notified that merchandise is shipped until the date it pays for the goods in united states dollars 
pursuant to the terms of certain of the company s license agreements for the sale of products in canada  the company must pay royalties in canadian dollars 
play by play europe also has license agreements for the sale of stuffed toys in europe and other continents  which require the subsidiary to pay royalties in united states dollars 
as a result of these license agreements  the company experiences currency risk to the extent that exchange rates fluctuate from the date the royalty liability or minimum guarantee is incurred until the date the royalty is actually paid to the licensor 
additionally  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk for intercompany receivable and payable transactions through the settlement date 
historically  no attempt has been made to minimize  by means of hedging or derivatives  the risk of potential currency fluctuations  since the currency risk has not been significant to the company on a consolidated basis 
the total unhedged exposure related to currency risk at july  was million 
the company experienced significant growth in net sales and net income during and due in part to the ace and tlc acquisitions which occurred in june and november  respectively 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful and results of operations from prior periods may not be indicative of future results

the approximate increase in sales to retail customers from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to the continued growth in domestic and international retail sales of  or million  and  or million  respectively 
this domestic growth was primarily attributable to the introduction of several new product lines added during fiscal the decrease in retail sales as a percentage of total sales from fiscal to fiscal was principally due to the fact that ace is predominantly a supplier to the amusement industry whereas  prior to the ace acquisition  the company had a more even sales mix of retail and amusement customers

interest expense increased or approximately million  to million for fiscal from  in fiscal  principally as a result of the financing of the acquisition of ace 
other income decreased or approximately  due to the interest earned on interest bearing accounts and short term securities during fiscal generated from the initial public offering 
such interest bearing cash and investments were used to partially fund the acquisition of ace 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for fiscal reflects an effective tax rate of  compared to the fiscal rate of 
the decrease is attributable primarily to a low statutory tax rate on sales by the hong kong subsidiary in fiscal  and to an investment tax credit in spain related to the november acquisition of tlc 
in addition  in fiscal a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax asset related to a capital loss carryover  which increased the effective rate for that year 
liquidity and capital resources at july   the company s working capital was million compared to million at july  this increase was primarily attributable to the completion of the company s follow on public offering of its common stock in december and the net reduction in amounts borrowed under the company s line of credit 
the company satisfies its capital requirements and seasonal working capital needs with cash flow primarily from borrowings and secondarily from operations 
the company s primary capital needs have consisted of funding for acquisitions  acquisitions of inventory  customer receivables  letters of credit  licenses and international expansion 
on december   the company sold  shares of its common stock in a follow on public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds after deducting underwriters discounts and other expenses were approximately million 
in december  a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay indebtedness of approximately million outstanding under the revolving credit term loan with letter of credit facility credit facility and approximately was used to fund the company s operations and other working capital needs ie european expansion 
during july  the company completed a private placement of convertible debentures with three investment funds in the aggregate amount of million 
the proceeds were used to retire a million subordinated demand note due to a shareholder  to provide million of collateral on two lines of credit with certain banks in spain  and for general corporate purposes 
interest accrues at per annum  payable monthly until maturity on june  no principal is due until june  at which time principal is payable monthly at a rate of of the outstanding balance with the remaining balance due at maturity 
the debt is convertible into common stock at any time during the loan period at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible debt holders may force redemption upon a change of control of the common stock  a change in the composition of two thirds of the company s board  or if the common stock received in conversion cannot be publicly traded 
the company incurred costs of approximately  in connection with the issuance of the convertible debentures 
such costs were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the seven year term of the convertible debentures on a straight line basis  which approximates the interest method 
as of july   the revolving line of credit balance was million  the term loan balance was million  and the amount of convertible debt outstanding was million 
as of july   the company had an aggregate of million in outstanding irrevocable letters of credit and bankers acceptances 
based on the level of the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventory at july   the company had million of additional borrowing capacity available under the credit facility 
the credit facility matured on june  and was extended through january  the company expects to either extend or refinance the credit facility prior to january  however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to refinance or obtain a new line of credit  or that if obtained  it will be on terms at least as favorable as those on the existing line of credit 
as of july   playobyoplay europe had an aggregate of approximately million outstanding in irrevocable letters of credit in support of inventory purchases 
the company s current policy is to permanently reinvest all earnings from foreign subsidiaries in those operations 
this policy restricts the amount of cash available for distribution by these subsidiaries  however  the company may obtain cash from the subsidiaries for repayment of intercompany obligations incurred in the normal course of business 
in the event the company changes its policy  a tax liability will be incurred for previous undistributed earnings  and any distributions would be subject to withholding and current income taxes 
during fiscal and  the company used proceeds from the aforementioned debt facilities  stock offerings  and operations to fund its growth 
during this period of time a majority of the company s net sales were derived from licensed products  a trend which the company believes will continue 
as the company continues to expand internationally and obtain additional licenses  the company expects greater pressure to be placed on the company s liquidity needs to fund significant additional royalty advances and guarantees of minimum royalty payments 
minimum royalty guarantees have increased from million at july  to million at july  certain license agreements require the company to maintain standby letters of credit or insurance bonds in favor of the licensors securing payment of the company s guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligations 
the company believes that its credit facility after extension or as refinanced  and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund such growth 
the company s operating activities used net cash of million in fiscal and provided net cash of million in fiscal the cash flow from operations for fiscal was primarily affected by changes in accounts receivable as a result of the strong increase in sales experienced by the company  as well as inventory which increased in part due to the strong increase in sales as well as to support the expansion in the european market

during fiscal  cash was used to repay borrowings on the revolving line of credit of million  repay million principal on the term loan  repay the million note to the principal shareholder and reduce the subordinated loan from the ace sellers of million 
the company believes that its current available cash  net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through january  the company believes that it will be able to extend or refinance the credit facility by january  however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to refinance or obtain a new line of credit  or that if obtained  it will be on terms at least as favorable as those on the existing line of credit 
euro 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union will introduce the euro  which will then become the common currency among the participating member countries 
the participating members sovereign currency will be converted to the euro at the exchange rates in effect on the introduction date 
spain is one of the participating members  which is the country in which play by play europe is located 
play by play europe intends to keep its books in spain s sovereign currency  the peseta  through the substantial portion of the three year introductory period  at the end of which all companies in participating member countries must adopt the euro 
as play by play europe s accounting system is currently capable of performing the euro conversion  the company does not anticipate that the costs related to the conversion will be significant 
in addition  as play by play europe operates primarily in spain and in non european union countries  management does not anticipate that the introduction of the euro will have a material effect on play by play europe s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows for the forseeable future 
dividend policy 
the company has never paid any cash dividends 
for the foreseeable future  the company expects to retain earnings to finance the expansion and development of its business 
any future payment of cash dividends will be within the discretion of the company s board of directors  and will depend on  among other factors  the earnings  capital requirements  operating and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors  and compliance with various financing covenants such as those contained in the agreements relative to the credit facilities to which the company is or may become a party 
year similar to many business entities  the company will be impacted by the inability of computer application software programs to distinguish between the year and due to a commonly used programming convention 
until such programs are modified or replaced prior to  calculations and interpretations based on date based arithmetic or logical operations performed by such programs may be incorrect 
management s plan addressing the impact on the company of the year issue focuses on the following areas application systems  process control systems embedded chips  technology infrastructure  and third party business partners and suppliers with which the company has significant relationships 
management s analysis and review of these areas is comprised primarily of five phases developing an inventory of hardware  software and embedded chips  assessing the degree to which each area is currently in compliance with year requirements  performing renovations and repairs as needed to attain compliance  testing to ensure compliance  and developing a contingency plan if repair and renovation efforts are either unsuccessful or untimely 
management has substantially completed the inventory and assessment phases regarding application systems  process control systems and technology infrastructure  and is performing upgrades  repairs and testing of the former two categories 
the review of physical infrastructure and business partners and merchandise suppliers is in the inventory stage 
while the company anticipates that any additional assessment efforts will be completed by the end of calendar year costs incurred to date have primarily consisted of labor from the redeployment of existing information technology  legal and operational resources as well as computer hardware and software costs 
the company has budgeted approximately million for these year compliance efforts  however  the company s year program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various aspects of the program are subject to change 
the company is currently replacing its financial and core business system software with new applications that are year compliant 
the company has formed a contingency team to develop a work plan in the event that such programs are not fully operational by july of calendar year the company does not presently anticipate a material business interruption as a result of the year the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s current and planned activities with respect to the year problem are expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material customers and suppliers 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the planned activities as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
although there is a risk that the company s plans for achieving year compliance may not be completed on time  failure to meet critical milestones identified in our plans would provide advance notice such that appropriate steps could be taken to mitigate the risk of failure 
management believes that its customers and suppliers would also receive advance notice allowing them to implement alternate plans 
seasonality both the retail and amusement toy industries are inherently seasonal 
generally  in the past  the company s sales to the amusement industry have been highest during the third and fourth fiscal quarters  and collections for those sales have been highest during the succeeding two fiscal quarters 
the company s sales to the retail toy industry have been highest during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  and collections from those sales have been highest during the succeeding two fiscal quarters 
the company s working capital needs and borrowings to fund those needs have been highest during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
as a result of the company s increased sales to amusement customers and to retail customers  the company anticipates that its borrowings to fund working capital needs may become more significant in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company utilizes borrowings under the credit facility to finance purchases of inventory and accounts receivable  primarily during peak selling periods 
during fiscal  the highest level of aggregate borrowings under the credit facility was million in august the following sets forth the company s net sales by fiscal quarter for fiscal  and fiscal year fiscal quarter in thousands first    second    third    fourth    inflation the company does not believe that inflation in the united states or europe in recent years has had a significant effect on its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement 
statement establishes standards for the way public business enterprises are to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires those enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
statement replaces the industry segment concept of statement with a management approach concept as the basis for identifying reportable segments 
the management approach is based on the way management organizes decisions for assessing performance 
statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  management has not yet determined the impact  if any  that sfas will have on its financial statement disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates ie prime rate or libor  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states us dollar and functional currencies of its subsidiaries ie british pound spanish peseta 
in addition  the company is exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or are likely to experience an economic downturn  such as china and latin america 
the company purchases substantially all of its inventory from companies in china  therefore  the company is subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while the company believes if such as event were to occur  it would be able to find alternate sources of inventory at competitive prices  however  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful 
the company has million of accounts receivable outstanding payable in us dollars from two companies based in mexico and brazil 
if the currencies of these countries were to fall significantly against the us dollar  there can be no assurance that such companies would be able to repay the receivables in full 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of july   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize its market risk 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is variable based on libor and or the prime rate  and therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at july   approximately million was outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
the credit facility matures january  the company expects to either extend or refinance the credit facility prior to january  however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to refinance or obtain a new line of credit  or that if obtained  it will be on terms at least as favorable as those on the existing line of credit 
see liquidity and capital resources 
foreign currency risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in valencia  spain and doncaster  england 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in spanish pesetas or british pounds  respectively  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the pesetas us dollars exchange rate and british pounds us dollars exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the spanish peseta or the british pound 
purchases of inventory by the company s european toy subsidiary from its suppliers in the far east are subject to currency risk to the extent that there are fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the spanish peseta 
certain of this european subsidiary s license agreements call for payment of royalties in a currency different from their functional currency  and these arrangements subject the company to currency risk to the extent that exchange rates fluctuate from the date that royalty liabilities are incurred until the date royalties are actually paid to the licensor
