item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in and during the remainder of the s focused on developing and marketing a software application product for use by roadway design professionals 
in  the company  under new management  began to expand significantly its product line to include complementary software application products for use by a variety of aec professionals 
the expansion of its product line was accomplished through both internal development and through acquisitions 
on january   the company added modules of landscape architecture environmental planning application software as a result of the landcadd acquisition 
on march   the company added modules of geographic information systems software to its product line as a result of the fms acquisition 
on november   the company added modules of structural engineering software as a result of the ecom merger 
on july   the company added modules of building designed construction software as a result of the cibc acquisition 
the landcadd acquisition  the fms acquisition and the cibc acquisition  were each accounted for under the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of operations of such businesses are included in the company s results from their respective dates of acquisition 
for each acquisition  the aggregate cost over the fair value of acquired net assets has been assigned principally to purchased research and development and software development costs based on their estimated fair market values 
the portion of the aggregate purchase prices allocated to research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was charged to expense on the date of purchase 
accordingly  the company s results of operations reflect a non recurring charge for purchased research and development of approximately  for fiscal the ecom merger was accounted for as a pooling of interest  however  it did not have a material effect on financial statement and therefore such statements have not been restated 
in autodesk  the company whose cad platform the majority of the company s business is based upon bought softdesk  a major competitor of eagle point 
additionally  bentley systems  the developer of the microstation cad platform upon which a portion of the company s civil engineering surveying modules are based  purchased in an equity interest in geopak  also a competitor of eagle point 
in both of these situations  eagle point is now competing with companies with whom it previously did not compete 
as further evidence of the new competitive pressures  autodesk notified eagle point that as of january   eagle point would no longer be allowed to resell autocad 
the company was allowed to continue to sell any autocad held in inventory as of january  these resales accounted for approximately  or million  of the company s revenues and  or  of the company s gross profit for fiscal the inability to resell autocad in the future will have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and gross profit and could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell it s own products 
see risk factors competition 
the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades by the company  the company s competitors or autodesk  customer acceptance of software applications  product development expenses  announcements or changes in pricing policies by competitors  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of domestic versus international revenues  the existence of product errors or bugs  and the hiring and training of additional staff could contribute to this variability of quarterly results 
economic and other factors affecting the building  construction  architecture  mapping and engineering industries could also affect demand for the company s products in one or more particular quarters 
a significant portion of the company s net revenues in a quarter are derived from orders received later in that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
as the markets in which the company competes mature and new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could affect quarterly operating results

impact of the year issue the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
computer systems based on a two digit format will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the company believes that it has four general areas of potential exposure with respect to the yk problem its own software products  internal informational systems  computer hardware and other equipment related systems  and external 
based on the company s analysis through september   the company does not believe that the yk issue will materially affect its business 
the company believes that its own software products will not be effected by the yk issue because the company s products are graphical computer aided design software involving geometric and analytical computations and graphic representations which do not store or manipulate date related fields 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company began to develop a systematic plan the yk plan to evaluate its yk exposure with respect to its internal informational systems 
in accordance with this plan  the company identified two primary internal information systems pursuant to which the company could have exposure its accounting and financial support system the accounting system and its sales database the sales database 
the company believes that  based on industry reports  the accounting system is already yk compliant  but has not yet received formal certification of such compliance from the accounting system s manufacturer 
the company intends to seek such certification in the near future 
if the accounting system is already yk compliant  the company will not incur any significant yk related costs with respect to the accounting system 
the company has determined that the sales database is not currently yk compliant 
however  the company has received  at not cost to the company  from the sales database s manufacturer the necessary software upgrade to cause the sales database to become yk compliant 
while the company expects the sales database upgrade to be effective  the company has not yet tested such upgrade and there can be no assurance that it will be successful 
the third type of potential yk exposure relates to the company s computer hardware and other equipment related systems such as the company s workstations and phone system 
the company is in the early stages of identifying and evaluating such systems yk exposure 
due to the early stage of analysis with respect to the company s computer hardware and other equipment related systems  the company cannot yet estimate the costs involved  although the company does not expect such costs to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
the fourth aspect of the company s yk analysis involves evaluating major vendors yk exposure and their efforts to address such exposure 
the company is currently working on a formal procedure to evaluate such third parties  but has not yet commenced such process 
as part of this formal procedure  the company expects to survey its key vendors through written or telephone inquiries 
the company intends to have existing employees conduct such inquiries beginning in the fourth quarter of calendar year and does not expect the costs of such inquiries to be material 
if the company determines  after conducting the aforementioned surveys and inquiries  that its vendors yk issues could result in material disruptions to their respective businesses  the company may seek alternative suppliers 
the company expects to be yk compliant with respect to its own systems  and have completed its yk analysis with respect to third parties  no later than mid inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  nor does the company expect it to have a significant impact in fiscal year the company has experienced insignificant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions since substantially all of its international sales to date have been billed in us dollars 
as the company continues to expand its international operations it may begin billing in foreign currencies which would increase the company s exposure to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts if deemed appropriate at that time
