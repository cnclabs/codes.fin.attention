year issues many computers and software programs were designed to accommodate only two digit date fields to represent a given year eg represents 
it is possible that such systems will not be able to accurately process data containing information related to the calendar year or later 
the year issue has the potential to affect the registrant through the failure to process business transactions both at the registrant and between the registrant and its business partners 
in addition  claims to cover costs associated with the issue may be asserted against insurance contracts in which the registrant participates 
in april  the registrant designated a year team consisting of the chief executive officer  the principal financial and accounting officer and the manager of information systems 
a year yk plan was developed  communicated to the board of directors and senior management  and implemented 
the yk plan is designed to i assess compliance of internally used computer hardware and software programs  ii determine compliance issues with infra structure systems such as telephone systems  production line equipment  shipping systems  and facility heating and air conditioning equipment  iii conduct yk compliance surveys with mission critical business partners to include major customers and suppliers of goods and services  iv implement appropriate testing procedures to measure actual compliance  and v develop and institute contingency plans to mitigate any unforeseen yk issues 
the registrant has reviewed virtually all of its internally used computer hardware and software for year compliance 
non compliant hardware has either been replaced  scheduled for replacement  or placed in non mission critical functions 
the critical computerized business systems utilized by the registrant are primarily based on software products licensed from third parties that specialize in software development 
these software vendors indicate that their products will be made compliant on a timely basis 
in addition to purchased software  there are some program applications that have been developed internally 
these programs are being assessed and those deemed to be critical to the business will be modified or replaced 
while the registrant believes that its computer hardware  licensed software  and internally generated software critical to its business will be compliant on a timely basis  there can be no assurance that every such product will be compliant on a timely basis and there can be no assurance that there will be no material disruption to the registrant s business if such products are not compliant 
the registrant believes that the actual expenses involved in making the internal processing system year compliant will not be material when completed 
the registrant is in the process of surveying its mission critical business partners who provide goods and services 
as a result  a thorough assessment of any significant barriers to year compliance has not been completed 
final assessment and development of any related contingency plans to prevent a material disruption in the registrant s business is scheduled for completion by december  the costs associated with this phase of the plan are being expensed as incurred and are not expected to be material 
because the registrant relies on the business activities of its many business partners to be year compliant  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material disruption to the registrant s business or an increase in the cost of doing business 
the registrant expects to utilize calendar to continue its evaluation efforts regarding all phases of year compliance 
pertinent contingency plans will be developed based on substantive determination that year non compliance situations exist which could be disruptive and costly to the registrant s business activities in the year and beyond
