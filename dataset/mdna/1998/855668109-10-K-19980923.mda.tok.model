item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales sales increased in fiscal following a increase in fiscal domestic sales accounted for most of the increase in the current as well as the prior year as a result of continued good economic conditions in our industry 
foreign sales  however  have increased only slightly during the past two years 
the strong british pound has been adversely affecting scotland s business both in terms of export pricing and domestic import competition 
in brazil  high real interest rates and a recessionary economy have held sales back  particularly in the current year 
the weakening of brazil s currency caused the local currency sales increase to be reduced by about percentage points in both and after conversion to us dollars 
earnings before taxes pretax earnings are up for the year 
this follows a increase in cost of sales was about in  in  and in the improvement in these rates is consistent with added manufacturing efficiencies and increased production levels  particularly in domestic operations where pretax earnings are up this year and were up last year 
on the foreign side  the strong pound mentioned above had a significant negative effect on margins and was primarily responsible for a drop in foreign pretax earnings 
in  reductions in selling and general wages in brazil enabled our foreign pretax earnings to increase despite level sales 
income taxes the effective tax rate is in compared to in both and tax exempt interest on short term investments in municipal bonds  puerto rico tax incentives and somewhat lower foreign income tax rates all contribute to an overall effective tax rate that is slightly lower than the combined us state and federal statutory rate 
however  as taxable income has increased in the past several years  the effect of these items has diminished 
in addition  the overall effective rate has been favorably impacted by lower rates in brazil starting in although the statutory rate in brazil is now comparable to the us federal rate  nonrecurring permanent differences between book and taxable income for dividends paid to the us in and and local monetary correction adjustments in reduced the brazilian effective tax rate substantially when reported in us dollars 
net earnings as a result of the above  net earnings were up in fiscal when compared to and net earnings were up when compared to market risk market risk is the potential change in a financial instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices 
the company s operating activities expose it to many risks that are continually monitored  evaluated  and managed 
proper management of these risks helps reduce the likelihood of earnings volatility

the company does not engage in regular hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
net monetary assets in scotland and brazil are approximately million and million  respectively 
inflation in brazil has decreased to less than today from over in when their current economic plan was initiated 
as a consequence  their economy ceased to be considered hyperinflationary as of january year the well publicized year problem  which is common to most corporations  is associated with the inability of computer systems to process date related information beyond the year the company does not currently anticipate any material disruption of its operations as a result of any failure by the company to be year compliant 
if  however  the company  its customers or its suppliers are unable to achieve year compliance  the potential exists for the company s business and results of operations to be adversely affected 
worldwide  the company has four major computer systems that are used in the areas of manufacturing  sales and accounting 
two use third party packages that the company believes are or  through vendor upgrades  will be year compliant 
the other two systems are in the process of being converted to third party packages that the company believes are already compliant 
the company expects to complete the reasonably necessary remediation of its significant systems by the end of fiscal and has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  significant additional separately identifiable costs in order to make its computer systems year compliant 
in the event the company s planned upgrades and modifications fail to bring any of these major systems into year compliance or fail to do so in a timely manner  the company will have to adopt contingency plans to deal with any resulting disruptions in its business 
the company employs certain manufacturing processes that utilize computer controlled manufacturing equipment 
the company believes such equipment is year compliant to the extent reasonably necessary but has not completed its testing of such equipment 
in the event the company determines that such equipment cannot readily be made year ooo compliant  it believes it can revert to the manual processes previously employed or outsource such work 
the company is also in the process of investigating the status of other systems with respect to year compliance such as phone  fax  heating air conditioning  and electricity and believes they will be year compliant to the extent reasonably necessary before the end of the company is utilizing internal resources for this purpose and does not expect to incur significant separately identifiable costs 
in addition to reviewing its own systems  the company has polled or is in the process of polling its significant customers and vendors to get assurance that they are year compliant and to attempt to identify potential issues 
to the extent such assurance is not received  appropriate contingency plans will be developed and implemented 
at this time  the company is not aware of significant problems 
if the company s customers and vendors do not achieve year compliance before the end of  the company could experience a variety of problems that might have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
for example  customers might lose edi capability or vendors might fail to deliver  but most foreseeable problems can be overcome by reverting to phone  fax  mail and other manual procedures 
it should be noted that the company outsources very little other than raw steel and is not dependent on single source suppliers 
in addition it has no customer accounting for more than ten percent of sales

while the company is in the process of upgrading and modifying its systems in order to address the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company s existing systems will be upgraded or modified in time to remedy the year issue or that the company s computer systems will not be disrupted upon the turn of the century

in particular  the company s brazilian operations  which constitute over half of the company s revenues from foreign operations  can be very volatile  changing from year to year due to the political situation and economy 
as a result  the future performance of the brazilian operations is inherently unpredictable

as such  recessionary forces decrease demand for the company s products and adversely affect performance 
risks related to competition the company s business is subject to direct and indirect competition from both domestic and foreign firms

under certain circumstances  including significant changes in us and foreign currency relationships  such pricing pressures might reduce unit sales and or adversely affect the company s margins
