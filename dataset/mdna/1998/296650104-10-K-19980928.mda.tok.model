item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company presently operates a one segment manufacturing business 
it principally manufactures power supplies and components for military and industrial use 
sales volume is primarily dependent on product mix in any given fiscal period 
this mix is in many cases subject to the dictates of customer needs and delivery requirements 
these factors principally account for any variation in sales and operating income from year to year 
sales for fiscal years ended june    and were   and  respectively 
the decrease in sales for the past three years  as previously discussed in the annual report to shareholders management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  was primarily a result of the consolidation and relocation of the facilities and personnel of one of the company s major customers  and the attendant delay in its issuance of new orders and establishment of new programs 
the effect of this situation has diminished to a point where the company s backlog at september   stands at approximately  as mentioned above  the backlog at june  was  whereas at june  the backlog was  during the first two months of fiscal  the company received approximately  in new orders 
as mentioned above  the decrease in sales was due primarily to the relatively low june  backlog 
this problem currently seems to have been resolved 
this reversal is evidenced by comparing the results of the third and fourth quarters 
whereas the third quarter showed a gross loss of  the fourth quarter showed a gross profit of  the company expects the full effect of the increased backlog to be realized in the second quarter of fiscal year the third quarter reflected a net loss of 
per share of common stock  whereas the fourth quarter reflected a loss of 
per share of common stock 
of the 
net loss  approximately 
per share of common stock is attributable to a one time charge taken as an unusual item 
this item relates to certain contracts entered into by the company in connection with the restructuring of its management 
this item is more fully explained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management restructuring and note to the financial statements 
the corresponding cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  for fiscal years  and were    respectively 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in is largely attributable to the decrease in sales for fiscal since many of our expenses are fixed costs  they are not  for the most part  significantly influenced by sales volume 
another major cause of the percentage increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  is the fact that in an effort to expand and diversify our product lines the company accepted various contracts during the course of the year with negative profit margins 
this matter was discussed in greater detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in the company s form q for the nine months ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately for the fiscal year 
no one factor accounted for this increase 
the company s total inventories show an increase of approximately  due mainly to the purchase of materials for orders received during the fourth quarter 
work in process  however  has decreased  and will to continue to decrease as anticipated orders are received 
the increase in accounts receivable reflects shipments made toward the end of the fiscal year 
a large majority of these receivables have been paid subsequent to the fiscal year end 
business outlook customer order patterns are inherently difficult to predict 
as noted in the annual report to shareholders management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  one of the company s major customers had undergone the consolidation and relocation of several of its facilities and various personnel 
the transition stage of this consolidation caused delays in both ongoing and newly proposed programs 
as reported above  however  the effect of this situation has been alleviated to a great extent and the company is receiving orders and proposal requests from this customer more consistent with its past experience 
the company currently has outstanding quotations well in excess of  for both repeat and new programs  in addition to increase option clauses in various existing contracts 
the company has already received major contracts for power supplies for a new locomotive  which should find extensive use throughout the world 
the company has also received substantial orders for spare parts on the various types of transmitters which are already in the field  and a number of contracts for further development and manufacture of numerous transformers using our recently patented quiet transformer technology 
the outstanding quotations mentioned above not only encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies  transformers  and subassemblies  but also represent a minimum of transmitters which are exclusive to the company 
these transmitters which are for use by foreign governments on a global basis should produce initial minimum revenues of  the company has also received an initial order for a newly designed grid antenna 
the total future value of this order could be approximately  however  the company is hopeful that this new technology will produce additional orders 
the company expects to receive a patent for this new antenna in the immediate future 
although there can be no assurance that the company will acquire any or all of the proposed orders described above since such a forward looking statement is subject to future events  market conditions  political stability of foreign governments  and allocations of the united states defense budget  management is presently anticipates that the company will realize both an increase in revenues and earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business  and during the past three fiscal years  the company  when possible  has funded all of its operations  including financing activities  with cash flows resulting from operating activities 
the company did not borrow any funds during the last three fiscal years and does not currently anticipate that it will borrow any funds during fiscal year the company s working capital as of june    and was   and  respectively

during fiscal years through  interest rates on short term investments ranged from to 
this factor accounts  along with the changes in the overall balances of short term investments and marketable investment securities  for the fluctuation of interest income during much of the five year period 
interest income was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal interest income in fiscal and  however  was affected by the decrease in the company s investment base arising from the capital expenditures of  in and purchase of the company s common stock in the amount of  during fiscal since a majority of the company s investment base is represented by certificates of deposit  united states government treasury securities and a money market account  the company does not feel that there is any significant risk associated with its investment policy 
the fluctuations in cash and short term investments reflected in the statements of cash flows are largely due to the company s purchases of investment securities with longer maturities than in prior years 
in addition  the company purchased shares of corporate preferred equity securities at a total price of  these securities are considered to be held for investment and are classified as available for sale
