jude medical  inc for royalty payments based on st 
jude s valve sales 
in a subsidiary was established to focus initially on the development of a synthetic blood vessel used to bypass blocked coronary arteries 
in the late s the company decided to leverage existing management expertise and entered the pacemaker lead business 
the strategic role of the pacemaker lead business was to provide cash flow to fund the development of synthetic grafts and thrombectomy systems and to give the company access to and name recognition within the medical device industry 
in the company made the decision to focus on medical products and subsequently divested all non medical operations  beginning with its technical services division in september followed by its industrial equipment subsidiary and related land and buildings in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march the company sold its pacemaker lead business because it anticipated that revenues from this business would decrease due to a pacemaker lead technology shift 
this sale enables possis to focus its human and financial resources exclusively on its other products  which are currently in clinical trials and in early stages of commercialization 
over the past several fiscal years  the company has transitioned its revenue stream from pacemaker leads and royalty revenues to revenues from the sale of its new products and related sales agreements

results of operations fiscal years ended july   and total revenue increased and in fiscal and  respectively  compared to prior years

us angiojet system product revenue was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal us product revenue increased by over fiscal since the us market introduction of the angiojet system  the company has listed its angiojet system drive unit  considered capital equipment  at  to hospitals 
despite employing a variety of flexible drive unit acquisition programs including outright purchase  rental  lease and fee per procedure  the company sold only drive units to us hospitals through march  in april  the angiojet system drive unit list price was reduced to  after a successful test of the lower price in two of the company s sales territories 
a lower drive unit sales price is intended to improve the competitive position of the angiojet system  facilitate evaluation of the technology  ease sale closure on units currently under evaluation and provide added time for the company s direct sales force to encourage use of the systems currently in the field 
since the lowering of the retail price to  in april there have been drive units sold to us hospitals versus drive units in the previous sixteen months

the pma presents the results of a patient randomized trial comparing angiojet system treatment to intracoronary infusion of the blood clot dissolving drug urokinase for patients with demonstrated clot in native coronary arteries and saphenous vein bypass grafts 
the randomized trial showed that angiojet system treatment had significantly better outcomes than the urokinase treatment for procedure success and device success 
angiojet system treatment also had lower in hospital major cardiac complications  including fewer bleeding complications and vascular complications 
also  the results of a cost effectiveness trial run concurrently with the coronary angiojet trials show that the angiojet system treatment costs are on average significantly lower than those associated with the use of urokinase 
the company believes that the treatment of blood clots in coronary vessels is a significant marketing opportunity for the angiojet system 
the company expects the us angiojet system sales will grow primarily through the addition of sales people  the completion of clinical trials designed to yield additional fda label approved product uses  the publication of clinical performance and cost effectiveness data  and the introduction of additional catheter designs
