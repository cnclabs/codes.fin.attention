during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales  and natural gas processing revenues increased by million from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes which were partially offset by a decline in commodity prices 
volume increased from  mboe to  mboe for the year ended december crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes increased by to  mboe during compared to mboe in  natural gas sales volumes increased by to bcf in compared to bcf in the increases in volumes were attributable to a full year of production from property acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of as well as increased production attributable to the company s ongoing development program on existing and acquired properties

ceiling limitation write down 
the company records the carrying value of its crude oil and natural gas properties using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties less related deferred taxes  are limited by country  to the lower of unamortized cost on the cost ceiling  defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at percent  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  the company is subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of the company s stockholder s equity 
the risk that the company will be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and gas assets increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if the company has substantial downward revisions in its estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if the company voluntarily cancels  long term contracts for its natural gas 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a write down of million  million after tax  related to its canadian properties 
no assurance can be given that the company will not experience additional write downs in the future 
should commodity prices continue to decline  a further write down of the carrying value of the company s crude oil and natural gas properties may be required

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales  and natural gas processing revenues increased from million in to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes of and natural gas sales volumes of which was attributable to increased production from the producing properties that the company owned for the entire year as well as producing properties acquired during the year 
this increase more than offset the loss of operating revenue the portilla and happy fields during the portion of the year that the company did not own the properties 
the company sold these properties in march and reacquired these properties in november during  the portilla and happy fields contributed million in operating revenue compared to million in crude oil and ngls sales volumes increased from mbbls to mbbls  from to and natural gas sales volumes increased from bcf to bcf  from to as a result of increased production volumes from the company s properties other than portilla and happy in as compared to and the acquisitions of the wyoming properties  the capital stock of cggs and the company s ongoing development drilling program 
portilla and happy contributed mbbls of crude oil and ngls of company total and mmcf of natural gas of company total during as compared to mbbls of crude oil and ngls of company total and mmcf of natural gas of company total for average sales prices were per bbl of crude oil  per bbl of natural gas liquids and per mcf of natural gas for the year ended december  compared with per bbl of crude oil  per bbl of natural gas liquid and per mmcf of natural gas for the year ended december  a general strengthening of crude oil and natural gas prices at the wellhead during resulted in a higher average sales prices received by the company during the year ended december  compared to the same period in lease operating expenses 
loe and natural gas processing costs increased by from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period of  primarily due to the greater number of wells owned by the company for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company s loe on a per boe basis for was per boe as compared to per boe in g a expenses 
g a expenses increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   as a result of the company s hiring additional staff  including establishment of a canadian administrative office  to manage the additional properties acquired by the company and subsequent development of those properties 
the company s g a expense on a per boe basis was per boe in compared to per boe for dd a expenses 
due to the increase in sales volumes of crude oil and natural gas  dd a expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the company s dd a expense on a per boe basis for was per boe as compared to per boe in interest expense and preferred dividends 
interest expense and preferred dividends increased  from million to million for the year end december   compared to the period 
this increase is attributable to increased borrowings by the company to finance the acquisitions consummated during long term debt increased from million at december  to million at december  general the company has incurred operating losses and net losses for a number of years 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas and the volumes of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by the company 
natural gas prices increased substantially during  however  gas and crude oil prices weakened somewhat during  crude oil prices have continued to be depressed in 
the average natural gas prices realized by the company were per mcf in compared with per mcf at december  and per mcf at december  during   crude oil prices averaged per bbl compared to during and per bbl during although the company had operating and net income during  losses were incurred in and and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
in addition  because the company s proved reserves will decline as crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced  unless the company is successful in acquiring properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities  the company s reserves and production will decrease 
ifcrude oil prices remain at depressed levels or if natural gas prices return to depressed levels  or if the company s production levels decrease  the company s revenues  cash flow from operations and profitability will be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources general capital expenditures in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures on a historical basis for the three years ended december   and year ended december dollars in thousands expenditure category property acquisitions   development    facilities and other  total    acquisition cost includes  common shares and  special warrants of cascade oil gas ltd 
valued at approximately million in related to the acquisition of certain crude oil and natural gas producing properties 
acquisitions of crude oil and natural gas producing properties during accounted for the majority of the capital expenditures made by the company 
during and  expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
these expenditures were funded through internally generated cash flow and borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   the company had current assets of million and current liabilities of million resulting in a working capital deficit of million 
this compares to working capital of million at december  the material components of the company s current liabilities at december  include trade accounts payable of million  revenues due third parties of million and accrued interest of million 
stockholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to a net loss incurred in  including the impact of the write down in the company s assets resulting from the impairment of the full cost pool 
see ceiling limitation write down the company s current budget for capital expenditures for other than acquisition expenditures is million 
such expenditures will be made primarily for the development of existing properties 
additional capital expenditures may be made for acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise  but the company currently has no agreements  arrangements or undertakings regarding any material acquisitions 
the company has no material long term capital commitments and is consequently able to adjust the level of its expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the price of crude oil continue to decline or if natural gas prices decline  the company s cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction in the capital expenditures budget 
the company will have three principal sources of liquidity during the next months i cash on hand  including the net proceeds of the offering of the series c notes  ii borrowing capacity under the credit facility and iii cash flow from operations 
while the availability of capital resources cannot be predicted with certainty and is dependent upon a number of factors including factors outside of management s control  management believes that the net proceeds of the offering of the series c notes  the company s cash flow from operations plus availability under the credit facility will be adequate to fund operations and planned capital expenditures 
the company may also sell additional equity or debt securities in order to fund operations and planned capital expenditures as well as to finance future acquisitions 
the credit facility has an availability of million 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility 
a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the series c notes were used to re pay the outstanding balance of the credit facility except for  which remains outstanding 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided million of cash to the company 
investing activities required million during primarily for the acquisition and development of producing properties 
financing provided million during operating activities for the year ended december   provided million of cash 
investing activities required million primarily for the acquisition of the wyoming properties  cggs and portilla and happy 
financing provided million during during  operating activities provided million of cash 
investing activities during utilized million of cash primarily for the development of existing properties 
total cash provided from financing activities for was million as the result of the sale of  shares of common stock and contingent value rights during november which resulted in net proceeds of million 
the company is heavily dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices which have historically been volatile 
although the company has hedged a portion of its natural gas production and intends to continue this practice  future crude oil and natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on the company s overall results  and therefore  its liquidity 
furthermore  low crude oil and natural gas prices could affect the company s ability to raise capital on terms favorable to the company

this agreement was assumed by the banks 
under the agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of while the banks will pay a floating rate equal to the usd libor bba rate for one month maturities  quoted on the eighteenth day of each month  to the company 
settlements are due monthly 
the agreement terminates in august at december   the fair value of this swap  as determined by bt  was approximately  in connection with the re acquisition of the portilla and happy fields  the company assumed a commodity price hedge on variable volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
monthly settlements with amounts either due to or from christiania are based on the differential between a fixed and a variable price for crude oil and natural gas 
during  the approximate monthly volume of crude oil sales subject to this agreement is  barrels at a fixed price of 
this agreement reduces to approximately  barrels per month in   barrels per month in   barrels per month in and  barrels per month in until november the fixed price paid to the company over this five year period averages per barrel 
the natural gas component of this agreement calls for approximately  mmbtu per month at a fixed price of during with volumes decreasing to  mmbtu per month in   mmbtu per month in   mmbtu per month in and  mmbtu per month in through october 
the fixed price paid to the company over this five year period averages per mmbtu 
at december   the estimated fair market value of the hedge agreement is a loss of approximately  the company has also entered into a fixed price agreement relating to approximately  net mcf per day of natural gas 
the agreement expires on march  and calls for a fixed price of per mmbtu to be paid to the company 
net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company had  subject to the limitations discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes  of which approximately million may be utilized before it expires 
these loss carryforwards will expire from through if not utilized 
at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for canadian tax purposes which expire in and as a result of the acquisition of certain partnership interests and crude oil and natural gas properties in and  an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section  occurred in december accordingly  it is expected that the use of net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to december  of million will be limited to approximately  per year 
as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock for acquisitions and sales of stock  an additional ownership change under section occurred in october accordingly  it is expected that the use of all us net operating loss carryforwards generated through october or million will be limited to approximately million per year subject to the lower limitations described above 
of the million net operating loss carryforwards  it is anticipated that the maximum net operating loss that may be utilized before it expires is million 
future changes in ownership may further limit the use of the company s carryforwards 
in addition to the section limitations  uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  the company has established a valuation allowance of million and million for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively
