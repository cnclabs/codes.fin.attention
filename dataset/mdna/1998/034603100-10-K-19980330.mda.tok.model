item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this section contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in this section and in the section entitled risk factors 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
total revenues decreased by  or during as compared to and by  or between and the decrease in is primarily a result of the completion of funding by abbott in under a collaborative funding agreement 
substantially all revenues in and were from development funding under the collaborative agreement with abbott relating to the actiq cancer pain program 
under the company s agreements with abbott  abbott manufactures anesta s ot fentanyl product line fentanyl oralet and actiq and sells these products to the company at a price which reflects abbott s cost of manufacturing 
the company then sells the products to abbott at a price related to abbott s selling price which results in a gross profit to the company ranging from approximately 
in addition  the company is entitled to receive a royalty on ot fentanyl product sales by abbott 
operating expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by  or during as compared to and increased by  or between and the decrease in and the increase in are due to higher expenditures in related to clinical research programs and preparation for filing the actiq new drug application nda see note to financial statements 
the company expects that its research and development expenses will increase in the future as a result of increased expenses related to the hiring of additional personnel  preclinical studies  clinical trials  product development  manufacturing process development activities and clinical trial material manufacturing 
depreciation expense increased by  or during as compared to and by  or between and the increase in is due to the company s remodeling of additional facilities and the increase in is primarily due to a decrease in the estimated useful life of specific leasehold improvements 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased by  or during as compared to and by  or between and the increase in and is due primarily to higher expenditures for personnel  corporate development activities  marketing research  actiq premarketing activities  and equipment leasing 
the company expects that its marketing and general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of the increased support required for marketing research  actiq pre launch market development and market launch activities  and corporate development activities 
non operating income expense 
interest income increased by  during as compared to and by  between and the increase in and is primarily due to income earned on the invested net proceeds from the company s secondary offering in june interest expense increased by  during as compared to and by  between and the increase in both years is primarily due to interest expense related to borrowings on the company s revolving term loan 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and relates solely to state income taxes 
the company recognized no tax benefit from its losses in those years 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to its net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards will depend on the generation of future taxable income 
because the company s operations are not currently generating taxable income  the company believes a full valuation allowance should be provided see note to financial statements 
accounting change 
effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for external legal costs related to patents 
prior to the change  the company capitalized these costs and amortized them over the term of the related patent 
under the new method  these costs are expensed as incurred 
net loss 
as a result of the decrease in total revenues  the increase in marketing  general and administrative activities and other factors discussed above  the net loss for was  or per share as compared to  or per share for and  or per share for the net loss for includes the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for patent costs of  or per share 
liquidity and capital resources in june the company realized net proceeds of  through the issuance of common stock in a secondary offering 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling   in a certificate of deposit used as collateral for a term loan as described below and  in marketable debt securities which are available for sale 
thus cash  cash equivalents  certificate of deposit and marketable debt securities totaled  as of december  cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested according to the company s investment policy  which provides guidelines with regard to liquidity and return  and  wherever possible  seeks to minimize the potential effects of concentration of credit risk 
the company s use of cash in operating activities increased by  during as compared to and by  between and the increase in cash used is a direct result of the decrease in total revenues  the increase in marketing  general and administrative activities and other factors discussed above 
during  the company made capital expenditures of approximately  as compared to  and  in and respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in and was due to the company s remodeling of facilities 
in order to finance the capital expenditures  the company  in january  secured a revolving term loan in the amount of  this loan converted to a year term loan on may  in march  the company borrowed an additional  for a total term loan of  during and  the company made principal payments of  each year 
the loan is collateralized by a  certificate of deposit 
during the company made no principal payments on capital lease obligations as compared to  and  in and respectively 
during the company realized cash proceeds of  relating to the exercise of stock options as compared to  and  in and respectively 
the company s future capital requirements could be substantial and will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  including progress of the company s research and development programs  the results and costs of preclinical and clinical testing of the company s products  if developed  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing patents  the time and costs involved in developing and maintaining collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of its products  and administrative and legal costs 
the company anticipates that the existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  and interest earned thereon provides adequate working capital through the company believes that it is prudent to monitor existing cash balances in order to fund the activities which the company believes are necessary to continue its growth 
therefore  the company periodically evaluates market conditions and various financing alternatives for obtaining funds to augment existing cash balances 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
management of the company does not anticipate that any significant modification or replacement of the company s software will be necessary for its computer systems to properly utilize dates beyond december  or that the company will incur significant operating expenses to make any such computer system improvements 
the company is not able to determine  however  whether any of its suppliers  lenders  or service providers will need to make any such software modifications or replacements or whether the failure to make such software corrections will have an effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity 
sfas requires that companies disclose segment data based on how management makes decisions about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance 
in addition  in february the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  concerning employer disclosure about pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
sfas  sfas and sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of these standards is not expected to have an effect on the company s financial statements  financial position or results of operations 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
dependence on abbott and other potential collaborative partners the company s strategy includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others for the development  clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of certain of its ots products 
to date  the company has entered into collaborations with abbott and ferrer 
the company has granted to abbott the exclusive right to make  use and market in the us the ot fentanyl product line 
the amount and timing of resources to be devoted by abbott to performing its obligations are not within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that abbott will perform its obligations as expected or that the company will derive any additional revenue from such arrangements 
moreover  the collaboration agreements with abbott may be terminated under certain circumstances 
abbott currently derives substantial revenues from products that may compete with products under development by anesta pursuant to its collaborations with abbott 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that abbott will not pursue its existing or alternative technologies in preference to products being developed in collaboration with the company 
abbott also markets products which  although not directly competitive with the ot fentanyl product line  may receive more sales and marketing resources 
if in the future abbott chooses to allocate sales and marketing resources toward other products  sales of the company s products and the company s financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that abbott will pay any additional fees to the company or that abbott will manufacture and or market any additional products under the agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future with other companies on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such collaborative arrangements will be successful 
to the extent that the company chooses not to or is not able to establish such arrangements  the company would experience significantly increased capital requirements to undertake such activities at its own expense 
in addition  the company may encounter significant delays in introducing products into markets or find that the development  manufacture or sale of its proposed products in such markets is adversely affected by the absence of such collaborative agreements 
moreover  if the company is forced to develop its products without collaborative arrangements  it would likely take a much longer period of time to test  manufacture and market such products which could adversely affect the company s financial results 
see business anesta s products and development programs and business collaborative relationships  abbott laboratories 
early stage of development  technological uncertainty anesta is at an early stage of its development 
although the company s first product has been approved by the fda and is being marketed in the us by abbott and anesta  the company s other potential products are at various stages of development and product revenues may not be realized from the sale of any such products  if at all 
many of the company s other proposed products will require significant additional research and development efforts prior to any commercial use  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing as well as lengthy regulatory approval processes 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will be successful  that the company s potential products will prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials or that any commercially successful products will ultimately be developed by the company 
see business anesta s products and development programs and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
uncertainties related to clinical trials before seeking regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of products under development  the company must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that such products are safe and effective for use in the target indications 
the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in large scale testing  and there can be no assurance that the company s clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result in additional marketable products 
clinical trials are also often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease 
during the course of treatment  these patients can die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested but which can nevertheless affect clinical trial results 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
if any of the company s products under development are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  the resulting delays in developing other compounds and conducting related preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as the need for additional financing  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business anesta s products and development programs 
history of operating losses  accumulated deficit the company has experienced significant operating losses since its inception in august as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
almost all of the company s revenues to date have been from research and development contracts and interest income 
the company expects to incur operating losses over the next few years as the company s research and development efforts and preclinical and clinical testing activities expand 
the company s ability to achieve profitability depends in part upon its ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete development of and to commercialize actiq  to complete development of its other proposed products  to obtain required regulatory approvals and to manufacture and market such products 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the development of the company s technology and potential products will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct the costly and time consuming research  preclinical and clinical testing activities necessary to develop and optimize such technology  to bring any such products to market and  ultimately  to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in the research and development of the company s technology and drug programs  the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for drug development  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in its existing research relationships and effective product commercialization activities and arrangements 
the company may seek additional funding through new collaborative arrangements or the extension of existing arrangements or through public or private equity or debt financings 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs or to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself 
government regulation the company s products require the approval of the fda before they can be marketed in the us in addition  approvals are also required from health authorities in virtually every foreign country before the company s products can be marketed in such countries 
before an nda can be filed with the fda  a product must undergo  among other things  extensive clinical trials 
the company has received approval from the fda on the nda filed for its initial product  fentanyl oralet 
in november  the company filed an nda for actiq 
however  in november  anesta received an unfavorable regulatory action letter from the fda for actiq 
additional data must be gathered  analyzed and submitted to the fda  and the issues raised by the fda must be resolved before actiq can be cleared for marketing 
the regulatory process is expensive and time consuming  and no assurance can be given that any nda or foreign regulatory submission submitted by the company will be approved on a timely basis  if at all 
there can be no assurance that problems will not arise that could delay or prevent the commercialization of the company s future products  or that the fda and foreign regulatory agencies will be satisfied with the information  including that emanating from clinical trials  contained in submissions such as ndas seeking approval and or that such agencies will approve the marketing of future products 
there can be no assurance that any future products developed by the company alone or in conjunction with others will be proven to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing activities can be susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent required regulatory approvals 
in addition  delays or denials of approval may be encountered based upon additional government regulation resulting from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy made during the period of product development and fda regulatory review 
similar delays may also be encountered in foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that even after such time and expenditures  regulatory approval will be obtained for any future products developed by the company 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval would be limited to those therapeutic uses for which the product has been demonstrated through clinical studies and other means to be safe and effective 
furthermore  approval may entail ongoing requirements for  among other things  post marketing studies 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product  its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities and pertinent operations are subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections 
the regulatory requirements pertinent to drug manufacturing and related activities are stringently applied and enforced by the fda 
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility  including pertinent operations  could result in fda restrictions being placed on such product or manufacturer  including an order to withdraw a specific product from the market 
there can be no assurance that in the future the fda or another governmental entity will not impose restrictions on the marketing or distribution of the company s products  even after the products have received fda approval 
restrictions on the marketing or sales of the company s products could significantly limit the sales of the company s products  resulting in a material adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
the company may establish collaborative relationships to conduct  among other things  clinical testing and seek regulatory approvals to market its products in major markets outside the us there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing such relationships or that such approvals will be received in a timely manner  if at all 
to market its products abroad  the company must comply with numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements implemented by foreign health authorities  governing  among other things  the design and conduct of clinical trials  pricing regulations and marketing approval 
the approval procedure may vary among countries and can involve  for example  additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although within the european union eu certain registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one eu member country 
if a regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety  quality and efficacy has been presented  marketing authorization is almost always granted 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval set forth above 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by other countries 
see business government regulation 
use of controlled substances the company s first product contains a controlled substance regulated by the drug enforcement administration dea and future products also may contain controlled substances 
the dea has expressed concerns to the fda regarding the potential for abuse of the drug fentanyl  including intravenous  patch and oralet dosage forms 
although the dea has not sought any specific restrictions on the marketing of fentanyl oralet  there can be no assurance that the dea will not seek such restrictions in the future 
products containing controlled substances may generate public controversy 
persons opposing the use of such products may seek restrictions on the marketing of such products  withdrawal of regulatory approval and rejection by the medical community 
political pressures and adverse publicity generated by such persons could cause delays and increased expenses  and adversely affect the marketing of fentanyl oralet and could similarly effect the introduction of future products 
if regulatory approval for the marketing of fentanyl oralet were to be withdrawn or special restrictions in addition to those generally applicable to controlled substances on the marketing of actiq for cancer pain were imposed by the fda  the company would be materially and adversely affected 
see business government regulation 
uncertainty of protection of patents and proprietary rights the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others  both in the us and in other countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions  and therefore the breadth and enforceability of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents cannot be predicted 
the basic technology underlying the company s proprietary ots was invented by dr 
stanley and brian hague  both employees of the company  while employed at the university of utah 
anesta is the exclusive worldwide licensee of such technology under patents held by the uurf through a license granted in which remains in effect for the life of all applicable patents 
the us patents expire on various dates ranging from to and the foreign patents expire on various dates ranging from to anesta maintains  at its expense  all us patent rights with respect to the licensed technology and files and prosecutes the relevant patent applications in the us and foreign countries 
the ots technology underlying anesta s exclusive license is covered by issued us patents  issued foreign patents  pending us patent applications and pending foreign patent applications 
any failure to file  prosecute or maintain any such patents could adversely affect the company s business 
anesta intends to file additional patent applications when appropriate relating to its technologies  improvements to its technologies and specific products it develops 
anesta also intends to direct the uurf to file any additional patent applications relating to the licensed technology 
there can be no assurance that any issued or pending patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or meaningful competitive advantages to the company 
the commercial success of the company also will depend  in part  on anesta not infringing patents issued to others and not breaching the technology licenses upon which any company products are based 
no assurance can be given that the company does not infringe the proprietary rights of others  and will not be required to alter its products or processes  obtain licenses to such third party rights or cease certain activities 
in addition  if patents are issued to others which contain competitive or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid  the company may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
if the company is required to obtain such licenses  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
the company s breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license required to commercialize its products may have a material adverse impact on the company 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to the company  may also be necessary to enforce any patents licensed or issued to the company or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
if competitors of the company prepare and file patent applications in the us that claim technology also claimed by the company  the company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to the company  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to the company 
an adverse outcome could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require the company to cease using such technology 
the company also relies on secrecy to protect its technology  especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable 
thus  anesta protects its proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and certain contractors 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
see business patents  proprietary rights and licenses 
uncertainty of market acceptance the company s products use a method of oral drug delivery  and no assurance can be given that any of the company s current or future products  if any  will ever achieve market acceptance 
physicians will not prescribe the company s products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data  and other factors  that these products are a preferable alternative to currently available products 
to date  the company s products have only been used by a limited number of patients  and no assurance can be given that its products will be adopted by a broader patient population 
the company believes that recommendations and endorsements by influential physicians will be essential for market acceptance of its products  and there can be no assurance that such recommendations and endorsements will be obtained 
in addition  the adoption of new pharmaceuticals is greatly influenced by health care administrators  inclusion on hospital formularies and reimbursement by third party payors 
no assurance can be given that health care administrators  hospitals or third party payors will accept the company s products on a timely basis  or at all 
the company may be required to  among other things  offer substantial discounts on its products or potential products to stimulate demand 
failure of the company s products to achieve significant market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business anesta s products and development programs 
lack of sales and marketing capability the company has no experience in sales  marketing or distribution and has entered into a distribution agreement with abbott with regard to the ot fentanyl product line in the us to market any of its products directly  the company would have to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capability or enter into marketing agreements with abbott or another pharmaceutical company with an established distribution system and sales force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish its own sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in entering into additional sales or marketing agreements with abbott or other collaborative partners 
see business collaborative relationships  abbott laboratories 
need to attract and retain key employees and consultants the company is highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific and management staff 
in addition  the company relies on consultants and advisors to assist the company in formulating its research and development strategy 
retaining and attracting qualified personnel  consultants and advisors will be critical to the company s success 
in order to pursue its product development and marketing plans  the company will be required to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development activities  as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing and marketing 
expansion in product process development and marketing is also expected to require the addition of management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the company faces competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  health products and biotechnology companies  universities and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms or at all 
see business human resources 
the company s clinical development is conducted under agreements with universities and medical institutions 
the company depends on the availability of a principal investigator for each such program and the company cannot assure that these individuals or their research staffs will be available to conduct clinical development 
the company s academic collaborators are not employees of the company 
as a result  the company has limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their time will be dedicated to company activities 
the company s academic collaborators may have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which could compete with the company 
intense competition  rapid technological change anesta is engaged in business in a rapidly changing field 
existing products and therapies  as well as technological approaches to developing such products and therapies  will compete directly with the products that the company is seeking to develop and market 
fentanyl oralet will compete directly with other drugs and drug delivery systems 
there can be no assurance that fentanyl oralet or any other anesta product will have advantages which will be significant enough to cause medical professionals to adopt its use 
the new products being developed by the company will compete with drugs marketed in other delivery forms  including oral doses  rectal doses  infusions  injections  nasal and pulmonary inhalers and transdermal products 
new drugs  or further developments in alternative drug delivery methods  may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific indication  or may offer comparable performance at lower cost  than those products offered by the company 
competition from fully integrated pharmaceutical companies is expected to increase 
most of these companies have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than the company 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies 
academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for product and clinical development and marketing 
many of these competitors have drug delivery products approved or in development and operate large  well funded research and development programs in these fields 
moreover  these companies and institutions are in the process of developing technology that could be developed more quickly or ultimately prove safer or more effective than the company s technology 
anesta faces competition based on product efficacy  safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of supply  marketing and sales capability  reimbursement coverage  price and patent position 
there is no assurance that the company s competitors will not develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than the company 
see business competition 
uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing  third party reimbursement and health care reform measures the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical companies will continue to be affected by the efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
in the us and in certain foreign jurisdictions there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system 
while the company cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect that such proposals may have on its business  the pendency or approval of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to raise capital or to obtain additional collaborative partners  and the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of the company s products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
future legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals could further limit reimbursement for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s potential products will be considered cost effective or that adequate third party reimbursement would be available to enable the company to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development 
in addition  the trend toward managed health care in the us and the concurrent growth of organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reduce government insurance programs  may all result in pricing pressure for current or future products of the company 
see business government regulation 
highly volatile stock price the market price of the shares of common stock  like that of the common stock of many other early stage pharmaceutical companies  is likely to be highly volatile 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial therapeutic products by the company or its competitors  progress with clinical trials  governmental regulation  changes in reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in the company s relationship with future collaborative partners  if any  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of drugs developed by the company and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock
