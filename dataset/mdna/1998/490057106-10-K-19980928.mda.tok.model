item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a medical device company which has established three technology platforms  puncture closure the angio seal  biomaterials collagen and resorbable polymers and revascularization the aegis vortex system avs 
the company participates in the puncture closure market primarily through its relationship with its strategic alliance partner  which generates royalty income  research and development funding and sales revenue through the manufacture of clinical devices and components for the angio seal 
the company s operations are focused on the commercialization and continuing development of its proprietary principal product  the angio seal product line  the continued expansion of its capabilities in biomaterials  and the development of its revascularization catheter system  the aegis vortex system 
the angio seal is a device for the sealing of arterial punctures created during diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular procedures such as angiography  angioplasty  atherectomy and the placement of stents 
the company is currently manufacturing collagen products for third parties for use as delivery systems for various applications including bone growth proteins  artificial skin for burn victims and drug delivery for products in various stages of clinical trials 
as a result of its absorbable polymer capabilities  the company has expanded into the orthopedic marketplace as an oem supplier of specialized products 
the company s revascularization platform has been established to address a market opportunity in cardiology for the treatment of occluded saphenous vein bypass grafts and in stent restenosis 
the company is developing a revascularization catheter system  the aegis vortex system  utilizing its patent platform and in house expertise to address these life threatening medical conditions 
in december  american home products corporation ahp or strategic alliance partner announced the sale of its subsidiary  sherwood davis geck  the operating company responsible for the sales  marketing and manufacturing of the angio seal device  to tyco international  ltd 
tyco 
under the terms of the sale  all of the company s agreements with ahp were transferred to tyco s subsidiary  the kendall company kendall 
accordingly  kendall replaced ahp as the company s strategic alliance partner in march  upon finalization of the sale 
the company s relationship with its strategic alliance partner has enabled it to obtain critical funding to research and develop the angio seal  conduct clinical trials and gain regulatory approval in the us and europe 
this relationship provides access for the angio seal product line to the major worldwide markets 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues for these periods consisted of net sales  research and development revenue  milestone fees and royalty income

the increase in net sales was mainly attributable to an increase in angio seal components sold to the company s strategic alliance partner  as a result of increased demand in the us and european markets  as well as the expansion of the company s third party business with other collagen and polymer customers 
approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal the increase in royalty income represented angio seal royalties from a full year of us sales compared to nine months of sales in fiscal  a significant increase in demand in the us and european markets and an increase in total royalty per unit resulting from the patent acquisition agreement see note of the financial statements 
the increase in research and development revenue related to contract research and development  including clinical trials  from the strategic alliance partner for additional sizes of and product enhancements to the angio seal product line 
the million milestone fee represented the final milestone under the license agreement and was earned by the company upon receipt of fda approval in the first quarter of fiscal cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase reflected greater net sales of products offset by manufacturing inefficiencies realized in the start up phase of production for the new sizes of the angio seal  the f and f  and new biomaterials products during the fiscal year 
research and development expense  including regulatory and clinical expenses  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company expanded the development of additional angio seal sizes and biomaterials products  including resorbable polymers and collagen  and increased clinical trial activity 
in addition  the company significantly expanded its development in revascularization technology as it targets commencement of clinical trials on the avs in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  in fiscal from fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain outside professional fees 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to cash equivalent and investment balances in the first quarter of fiscal  which included funds used in the repayment of the credit agreement

the million milestone fee represented the final milestone under the license agreement and was earned by the company upon receipt of fda approval in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in royalty income represented angio seal royalties from a full year of european sales and the commencement of us sales compared to only nine months of european sales in fiscal cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the fiscal cost of products sold represented a gross profit margin  a change in trend from a negative gross profit margin in fiscal this favorable trend resulted from manufacturing efficiencies realized as production levels increased 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company expanded the development of additional angio seal sizes and biomaterials products  including resorbable polymers and collagen  increased clinical trial activity and continued development of its revascularization technology 
six additional research and development employees were hired in fiscal as part of the increased activity 
accordingly  research and development expenses as well as related personnel costs increased in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the final recording of deferred compensation expense for nonofficers and directors during fiscal to reflect settlement of certain employee stock rights at the ipo
