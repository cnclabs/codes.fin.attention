item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the company has reported losses from operations in each of the past five years due to inefficiencies within its operations and due to an industry wide softness in retail sales 
as a result of such losses  the company had an accumulated deficit of  and a working capital deficiency of  at february  the company s management  which underwent a substantial restructuring after the financings discussed under liquidity and capital resources  has developed a strategic plan for the business which provides  among other things  for remodeling showrooms to provide a more appealing setting for customers  adding new showrooms in existing markets  increasing product prices to competitive levels  reducing promotional discounting  reconfiguring selling commissions  remerchandising  refocusing advertising  improving the manufacturing processes and reducing expenses through budgetary controls 
these plans have been implemented since the latter part of fiscal and are expected to contribute significantly to reducing losses and ultimately returning the company to profitability  however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability 
management believes that the company has sufficient sources of financing to continue operations throughout fiscal however  the company s long term success is dependent upon management s ability to successfully execute its strategic plan and  ultimately  to achieve sustained profitable operations liquidity and capital resources in recent periods  the company has utilized its working capital to cover operating deficits and to finance the remodeling and expansion of its showrooms 
in fiscal  management plans to remodel and upgrade approximately existing showrooms  as well as add approximately additional showrooms  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
management expects to fund such capital expenditures by internally generated cash and by borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company is not contractually committed to make these capital expenditures and could slow its expansion and remodeling program if the company experiences any liquidity shortages 
in may  the company raised approximately million through the issuance of convertible notes to certain related party investors 
in august and september  gecc and certain other investors led by mr 
hawley invested million in the company 
in connection with this financing  the company i issued approximately million of common stock  of which million was purchased by gecc and approximately million was issued to the holders of convertible notes in cancellation thereof  and ii issued to gecc a promissory note in the principal amount million  together with a warrant to purchase million shares at 
per share 
also in connection with this financing  the holders of shares of the company s pre existing preferred stock agreed to convert their shares into approximately million shares of common stock 
on august   the company completed transactions with two investors in which it issued  of subordinated notes with i warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share and ii warrants to purchase an aggregate amount of up to  shares of common stock at per share which warrants may be completely or partially cancelled depending on the economic performance of the company in fiscal also  the company arranged a standby credit facility of  which the company drew down on december  at the time the standby credit facility was drawn down  the company issued to the investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  additional shares of common stock at per share 
also in august  the company renegotiated the terms of its existing revolving line of credit with congress financial corporation by making a change in the advance rate that will provide greater borrowing capacity 
the credit facility currently has a maximum commitment of million  subject to borrowing base limitations 
the credit facility expires january   accrues interest at a rate of prime plus  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
as of february   the company had unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility of approximately million 
under the terms of the agreement related to the company s subordinated notes  as well as under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants and is prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness from third parties in an amount in excess of million 
as of february   the company was out of compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in both of the agreements but has obtained waivers 
the company may also be in violation of certain of these covenants as of interim periods during  but has obtained agreements to waive or amend covenants related to these potential default events 
management believes that it will be in compliance with other covenants  but in the event of noncompliance  the company also believes it can obtain waivers 
however  there can be no assurance that additional waivers will be obtained if the company fails to maintain compliance 
the company believes that borrowings under its credit facility and internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its requirements for working capital and capital expenditures through the end of fiscal year however  the company may need to raise additional funds to finance its remodeling and expansion program through either debt or equity financing  and there can be no assurance that the company s financial performance will generate sufficient funds 
the company currently contemplates that other sources of capital would be available  although this situation could change 
the aggregate annual maturities of long term debt during each of the five fiscal years subsequent to february  are approximately as follows  in   in   in   in  and  in management anticipates such payments will be made out of operating cash flow or refinancing 
as of february   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement of  cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended february   february  and january  is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows

the increase in sales is due principally to management s strategy of remodeling existing showrooms to provide a more appealing setting for customers showrooms were remodeled in fiscal  to management s strategies of developing new products  increasing the promotion and sale of accessories and revamping the marketing and sales promotion program and to improved economies in selected regions where the company operates gross profit

selling expenses for fiscal were  representing a decrease of  from fiscal selling expenses were of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal selling expenses increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to fixed showroom expenses applied to lower sales volume 
also  commissions  delivery expenses and advertising expenses were higher as a percentage of sales  offset in part by certain expenses which were lower as a result of having fewer stores operating in fiscal showroom preopening expenses are a component of the company s selling expenses 
the company has historically capitalized these expenses and amortized them over periods ranging from months subsequent to the opening of the showroom 
after the company amortized these expenses for new showrooms over a period of not more than months subsequent to opening of the showroom
