year concerns surrounding the year are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
thus programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather then the year resulting in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and converting to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted and there will be no substantial impact on the financial statements 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year issue may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
inflation could  however  affect the company s future revenues and operating income due to the company s dependence on its senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  the company s ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
the company typically does not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing its services  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future
