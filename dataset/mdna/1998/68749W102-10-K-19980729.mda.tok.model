revenue continued the reduction in revenue in fiscal is the result of a reduction in broadband revenues vs 
the prior year partially offset by a increase in revenue for satcom  telecom and wireless applications 
the reduction in broadband revenues reflects a continued slowdown in the domestic broadband industry due in part to a reduction in spending by tele communications  inc tci for network upgrades and  a reduction in the average price of forward path transmitters sold during the year in response to competitive pressures emanating from an unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates 
the increase in non broadband revenue was driven primarily by an increase in revenue for satellite and wireless applications 
total broadband revenues in fiscal reflected an increase of in revenues from gi following a decrease in the previous year and the addition of antec as a new domestic customer 
sales to antec represented of the total increase in revenues in fiscal and of the increase in broadband revenues

the decrease in gross margins to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal reflected a reduction in total revenues while certain other costs remain relatively fixed  a reduction in the average price of forward path transmitters in response to competitive pressures emanating from an unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates and the startup costs related to the introduction of certain new products 
the decrease in gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to a higher mix of product sold for wireless applications as these products generally have lower gross margins commensurate with lower production volumes as compared to the company s broadband products 
the company anticipates that gross margins in the near term may trend lower as a result of lower prices on its broadband products while the mix of wireless product increases ahead of the economies of scale that come with higher shipment volumes and on going cost reduction efforts associated with the introduction of a number of new products for broadband and wireless applications 
dollars in thousands change change research development    of revenue research and development expenses were relatively unchanged in fiscal vs
