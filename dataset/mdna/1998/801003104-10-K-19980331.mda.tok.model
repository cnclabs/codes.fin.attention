overview since its inception in  sangstat has focused on the development of products to improve the outcome of organ transplantation 
the company s revenue is primarily derived from the distribution of the company s therapeutic transplantation product candidate  thymoglobulin in canada from sales of its pre transplant monitoring products pra stat and cross stat the monitoring products in the united states  canada and europe 
sales of these organ transplantation products comprised  and of the company s net product sales in  and  respectively 
the company has also from time to time sold other monitoring products for laboratory research and investigational use and various devices and services 
these other revenue sources comprised  and of total product revenues in  and  respectively 
these other revenue sources are not central to the company s current or future strategy or operating objectives 
the company s accumulated deficit from inception through december  was  the company s operating loss has increased each year since inception and losses may be expected to continue in the near future as a result of a number of factors including the uncertainty in the timing and the amount of revenue to be earned upon product sales  expenses required for product development  clinical trials and marketing and sales activities 
in addition  the company s business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the success of its research and development efforts  litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  in particular  potential litigation with novartis regarding the company s cyclosporine product candidate  obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process  reliance on third parties to manufacture products or product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with health care reform measures 
even if the company s products appear promising at various stages of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the product candidates will be found to be ineffective or unsafe to manufacture on a large scale  be uneconomical to market  be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties or be unacceptable to providers  payors or patients 
additional expenses  delays and losses of opportunities that may arise out of these and other risks could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
results of operations net loss 
net loss increased from  in to  in and further to  in  primarily reflecting increases in research and development  including clinical trials and regulatory affairs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
total revenues 
net product sales decreased by  or from  in to  in and increased by  or to  in the decrease in sales from to was substantially due to a decline in revenues for thymoglobulin due to a decrease in the number of compassionate use cases which qualified for thymoglobulin under canada s edr program 
the decrease in thymoglobulin sales from to was partially offset by a increase in sales of monitoring products and the commencement of the transplant pharmacy sales 
the increase from to primarily reflects a increase in sales of monitoring products and an increase in sales of the transplant pharmacy 
as expected  no collaborative agreement milestone payments were received from baxter in or reflecting completion of the final milestones for pra stat and cross stat in the final payments of  in the first six months of represented the completion of million received by sangstat for milestones  license fees and equity from through under its collaborative agreement with baxter 
the company reacquired commercial rights for monitoring products from baxter in july  and now directly markets such products through its own sales and marketing staff in the united states and europe 
the company received an initial payment of  in from amgen under the collaborative distribution agreement for cyclosporine in certain territories outside the united states 
cost of sales and manufacturing 
cost of sales and manufacturing expenses increased by  or from  in to  in and increased further by  or to  in the increase from to was substantially due to additional costs associated with increased sales of monitoring products and commencement of the transplant pharmacy sales 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of thymoglobulin  resulting in a decrease of  in direct thymoglobulin costs 
the increase from to reflects declines of and in costs of sales for monitoring products and thymoglobulin  respectively  offset by the increased sales volume of the transplant pharmacy 
the company s monitoring products business does not currently generate a profit because the company has not achieved a scale of production that allows it to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by  or from  in to  in and increased further by  or to  in the increase from to was substantially associated with further expansion of clinical and regulatory activities associated with the company s pharmaceutical product candidates including the filing of an abbreviated antibiotic drug application anda for marketing clearance of its proprietary neoral bioequivalent cyclosporine product candidate with the fda in november the increase from to primarily reflects continued expansion of clinical and regulatory activities for cyclosporine and thymoglobulin 
in  the company completed several bioequivalence trials of its proprietary cyclosporine formulation versus novartis neoral in different populations of healthy volunteers as well as several conversion trials in stable kidney transplant recipients 
these trials were not requested by the fda but were conducted to provide additional data for opinion leader support 
sangstat also initialed several clinical studies for converting renal  heart and liver transplant recipients on novartis neoral to sangstat s cyclosporine 
the company also supported a phase ii trial utilizing thymoglobulin for induction therapy to prevent acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or from  in to  in and increased further by  or to  in the increase from to reflected in part the company s reacquisition of marketing rights to monitoring products from baxter in july and commencement in third quarter of sales of monitoring products through its own sales staff in the united states and europe 
as a result  sales and marketing expenses for monitoring products increased  from to general and administrative expenses increased by  from to as the result of the establishment of a pilot facility for the transplant pharmacy  as well as expanded investor relations and other general and administrative activities 
the increase from to reflects the company s expansion of its marketing and sales staff for its therapeutic product candidates thymoglobulin and cyclosporine and continued growth of the transplant pharmacy 
from to selling and marketing expenses increased by  for monitoring products and therapeutic products 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from to  reflecting continuing expansion of the transplant pharmacy as well and other general and administrative activities 
other income and expenses 
interest income increased by  or from  in to  in and by  or to  in these increases are due primarily to the increase in average cash balances available for investment as a result of the sale of equity securities during  and the company conducts its european operations through its wholly owned french subsidiary  sangstat atlantique sa and its canadian operations through its wholly owned subsidiary sangstat canada  ltd 
and does not currently engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
the company s operations in europe are primarily related to research and development  including clinical trial activities  for its pharmaceutical product candidates and sales and marketing activities for monitoring products 
the company s loss generated from its european operations increased by  or from  in to  in and by  or to  in these increases are primarily due to expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities 
the company has not historically experienced significant gains or losses associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations and does not believe it has significant exposure to risks associated therewith 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   the company has financed its operations substantially from proceeds of approximately  from private placements   in licensing fees and milestone payments from collaborative agreements and  from public offerings of its common stock 
during the years ended december   and  the company s net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in each year above is substantially due to the increased amount of net loss incurred in each year 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and total assets of net cash provided by financing activities totalled   and  during the years ended december   and such amounts were substantially comprised of proceeds received from the sale of common stock during the respective periods of   and  offset in part by net repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations 
net cash used in investing activities totalled   and  during the years ended december   and  and resulted substantially from the company s net purchases of short term investments 
although the company has no current contractual obligations relating to capital expenditures  it anticipates that capital expenditures  primarily for its united states operations  will aggregate approximately million during at december   the company had federal  state and foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately   and  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
in addition  the company had available research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state tax purposes 
the company s ability to realize the benefits of the nol and credit carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in the respective taxing jurisdiction prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to avail itself of such benefits 
furthermore  utilization of the net operating loses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loses and credits before utilization 
the company expects to incur significant costs related to  among other things  continued clinical and preclinical testing  regulatory approval activities and research and development programs in the future  and establishment of larger sales staffs in the united states and europe 
if and when the company receives fda approval of its therapeutic drug candidates  the company expects to have additional working capital requirements for expansion of sales  increased inventory levels and payment of certain license obligations 
if the company receives fda approval for thymoglobulin  it would be obligated to make a final milestone payment under a related license agreement totalling million 
the company may need to raise additional funds through additional financings  including private or public equity offerings and collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be raised on favorable terms  if at all  or that discussions with potential collaborative partners will result in any agreements 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next several years 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including its research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and the costs of manufacturing scale up and working capital requirements for inventory and financing of accounts receivable 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires that an enterprise report  by major components and as a single total  the change in its net assets during the period from nonowner sources  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise s business segments and related disclosures about its products  services  geographic areas  and major customers 
adoption of these statements will not impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
risk factors history of operating losses  future profitability uncertain 
sangstat was incorporated in and has experienced significant operating losses since that date 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was  the company s operating expenses have increased from approximately million to million to million over the last three fiscal years 
total revenues decreased from approximately million to million then increased to million while net losses from operations increased from approximately million to million to million over the last three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues from product sales or profitable operations 
to date  the company s product revenues have been substantially dependent on sales of certain organ transplantation products  including a limited number of monitoring products and sales of thymoglobulin in canada under canada s emergency drug release edr program 
no assurance of successful product development 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce and market its potential products 
much of the development work for several of the company s potential products remains to be completed 
there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained  or that any products if developed and introduced will be successfully marketed 
to date  the company has no drug products approved for commercial sale in any country 
the company s product candidates will require extensive development  testing and investment  as well as regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
cost overruns due to unanticipated regulatory delays or demands  unexpected adverse side effects or insufficient therapeutic efficacy will prevent or substantially slow the development effort and ultimately would have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will be successful and that any given product will be approved by appropriate regulatory authorities or that any product candidate under development will be safe  effective or capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at an economical cost  will not infringe the proprietary rights of others or will achieve market acceptance 
the company s first drug candidate  thymoglobulin  for which the company has licensed the rights from pmc in the united states and canada  has not yet been approved for commercial sale in these territories 
the company completed a single multi center phase iii clinical trial in the united states in august and filed an establishment license application ela with pmc and pla with the fda in august and january  respectively 
the company has also filed an nds for marketing approval in canada 
however  there can be no assurance that the results of this phase iii clinical trial  in combination with existing european safety and efficacy data and manufacturing process data  will be sufficient to support an ela  pla  or any necessary future ela supplement needed for commercial marketing 
in addition  there can be no assurance that thymoglobulin will be demonstrated to have the manufacturing or quality control specifications and requisite safety and efficacy so that an ela pla or nds will be obtained from either the united states or canada  respectively  or that thymoglobulin will be manufactured in sufficient quantities or will become a viable commercial product 
the company s other principal pharmaceutical product candidates  including the company s formulations of cyclosporine and azathioprine  as well as celsior and allotrap  have not been approved for commercial sale in any country 
the company commenced human bioequivalence trials with respect to azathioprine in october in the company voluntarily withdrew its k for a two component celsior product and is now conducting a clinical trial for a redesigned one component  ready to use celsior product candidate 
the company has completed a phase i clinical trial and an initial phase ii pharmacokinetic and safety clinical trial for allotrap  both of which took place in france 
the company designed both clinical trials to comply with regulatory standards in france as well as in the united states  so that it may use the data to support its nda to the fda 
there can be no assurance that such data will be accepted by the fda 
the use of allotrap peptides to promote graft acceptance in humans is novel and unproven and there can be no assurance that such peptides will prove to be safe or effective in humans for any clinical indication  including for any transplant type or at any dosage 
the company has no clinical evidence in humans that allotrap peptides will be effective in promoting graft acceptance or safety in transplant patients and there can be no assurance that allotrap or any other product candidates based on allotrap peptides will receive marketing approval or become viable commercial products 
certain of the company s monitoring product candidates are in development and have not been approved for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that these product candidates will be successfully developed  receive regulatory approval or be marketed on a profitable basis 
see business products and product candidates 
risks associated with cyclosporine 
the company is developing a generic cyclosporine for chronic immunosuppression 
commercialization of the company s cyclosporine drug candidate may be several years away and successful development and commercialization is subject to numerous risks  including failure to obtain regulatory approvals and potential intellectual property claims of third parties  including those of novartis and its manufacturing contractors 
in addition  if the company is unable to demonstrate to the fda that its formulation is bioequivalent to neoral  a currently approved novartis formulation  the company would be required to undertake additional development work and seek regulatory approval through the potentially longer nda process if it wished to continue to pursue this product candidate 
there can be no assurance that the proposed labeling  dosage form or manufacturing process of the company s cyclosporine  or the results of the company s cyclosporine bioequivalence study  will be accepted by the fda 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the current fda policies and regulations pertaining to the company s products or product candidates will not change in the future 
there can be no assurance that novartis will not seek to protect its market share through litigation  or other actions  against sangstat  its affiliates and partners  or the fda  or take actions which could adversely affect the regulatory approval process 
to date  no litigation has been commenced by novartis nor has novartis threatened the company with litigation 
in november  however  novartis filed a citizens petition with the fda  as described below  seeking to prohibit the use of neoral as a reference drug for demonstration of bioequivalence 
there also can be no assurance that sangstat s formulation will not be found to infringe on novartis proprietary rights 
if novartis brings suit against sangstat in the united states or elsewhere  sangstat could be greatly delayed in bringing any cyclosporine product candidate to market  or could be enjoined from selling the product for a significant period of time or ultimately be prevented from selling its cyclosporine product candidate entirely 
a number of key employees were previously employed at novartis and it is possible a claim could be asserted against sangstat based on such prior employment 
while the company believes that such a claim would be without merit  in part because such employees have informed the company that they did not have any non competition agreements with novartis and that they have not violated any confidentiality agreements with novartis  such a claim could nonetheless result in litigation 
any litigation  whether or not resolved in favor of the company  is likely to be expensive  lengthy and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to date no litigation has been threatened  but there can be no assurance that novartis will not commence litigation or otherwise attempt to delay the marketing of cyclosporine in the future 
novartis filed a citizens petition with the fda to remove the designation of its neoral cyclosporine product as a reference listed drug in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations the orange book 
a reference listed drug is an approved drug against which generic drug candidates can be measured to determine bioequivalence 
the fda has not yet acted on this citizen s petition 
the fda has accepted for review sangstat s cyclosporine anda submitted for approval based on bioequivalence to neoral 
neoral was listed as a reference drug in the orange book published in february however sangstat may be required to submit a full application nda rather than an anda for any generic cyclosporine product submitted for approval based on bioequivalence to neoral 
if the fda requires sangstat to file a full application rather than an anda for cyclosporine the time required for agency review of the application could be materially lengthened and adversely affect the likelihood of agency approval of the application 
in addition  in march of  novartis filed another citizen s petition requesting that the fda not approve any generic version of neoral not identical to the neoral product formulation 
novartis may submit additional citizens petitions and other documents and information to the fda that may raise other issues related to procedural and substantive requirements for approval of any sangstat cyclosporine application 
the submission of such petitions  documents  and or information could materially lengthen the time required for agency review of the application and adversely affect the likelihood of agency approval of the application 
cyclosporine is particularly difficult to manufacture and there can be no assurance that sangstat s cyclosporine drug candidate can be manufactured in commercial quantities at an economical cost 
there can be no assurance that sangstat can manufacture  or have manufactured  formulate or commercialize its cyclosporine product without infringing patent or other proprietary rights of novartis or other third parties 
although novartis composition of matter patent for cyclosporine expired in september in the united states  novartis patents relating to cyclosporine formulations are expected to continue to present significant barriers to entry to potential competitors 
the company has contracted for commercial scale production of cyclosporine bulk material ie the active ingredient of cyclosporine for its cyclosporine drug candidate from both gensia sicor and a second fda approved supplier 
gensia sicor received approval in july of an anda from the fda for the manufacture of bulk cyclosporine drug substance 
sangstat s second supplier of bulk cyclosporine drug substance has also been approved by the fda 
the company has also separately subcontracted the manufacture of the company s finished cyclosporine product with eli lilly 
sangstat s anda for us marketing clearance of its finished cyclosporine drug product is currently under review at the fda 
there can be no assurance that such third parties will perform satisfactorily and any such failure may delay regulatory approval  product launch  impair the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis  or otherwise impair the company s competitive position  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
even if regulatory approvals are obtained  uncertainty exists as to whether the company s products will be accepted by the market 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will receive an ab rating ie designation by the fda that a generic drug is bioequivalent to an fda approved reference listed drug  allowing substitution of one for the other on cyclosporine or azathioprine which in certain cases would require substitution of the company s cyclosporine for neoral and azathioprine for imuran  respectively 
in particular  there can be no assurance that the company s product candidates would obtain significant market share 
factors that may affect the willingness of patients  physicians  pharmacists and third party payors to convert to sangstat products  if approved  include price  perception of bioequivalence  perceived clinical benefits and risks  ease of use  other product features and brand loyalty 
in addition  other factors may limit the market acceptance of products developed by the company  including the timing of regulatory approval and market entry relative to competitive products  the availability of alternative therapies  the price of the company s products relative to alternative therapies  the availability of third party reimbursement and the extent of marketing efforts by the company or third party distributors or agents retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that patients  physicians  pharmacists  or third party payors will accept the company s products 
in particular  with respect to cyclosporine  there can be no assurance that even if product approval is obtained  the company will be successful in taking significant market share away from novartis 
uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for its products and to preserve its trade secrets 
the company holds patents and pending patent applications in the united states and abroad 
the company s patents involve specific claims and thus do not provide broad coverage 
there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications or any claims of these patent applications will be allowed  or found to be valid or enforceable  that any patents or any claims of these patents will provide the company with competitive advantages for its products or that such issued patents and any patents issued under pending patent applications will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by the company s competitors 
the company has not conducted extensive patent and prior art searches with respect to many of its product candidates and technologies  and there can be no assurance that third party patents or patent applications do not exist or could not be filed in the united states  europe or other countries which would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that any claims in the company s patent applications would be allowed  or found to be valid or enforceable  or that any of the company s products would not infringe on others patents or proprietary rights in the united states or abroad 
the allotrap peptide family is being developed under an exclusive  worldwide license from stanford university 
although stanford has filed patent applications with respect to such technology  there can be no assurance that  other than the patent application that has issued  any of the claims of such patent applications will be allowed  or found to be valid or enforceable and as to the issued patent  that the claims will be found to be valid or enforceable 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue 
since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  sangstat cannot be certain that it was the first to discover compositions covered by its pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such compositions 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of its issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
there can be no assurance that sangstat can manufacture  or have manufactured  formulate or commercialize cyclosporine without infringing third party patents 
although novartis composition of matter patent for cyclosporine expired in september in the united states  novartis process and formulation patents relating to cyclosporine are expected to continue to present significant barriers to entry to potential competitors because of the large number and scope of novartis patents  and the difficulty of solubilizing cyclosporine bulk material into a formulated drug product 
there can be no assurance that novartis or its contract manufacturers will not seek to protect its market share through litigation  or otherwise  or that sangstat s cyclosporine will not be found to infringe novartis or others proprietary rights 
any litigation  brought by novartis or other parties  whether or not resolved in favor of the company  is likely to be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that novartis will not commence litigation or otherwise attempt to affect the regulatory approval or marketing of cyclosporine in the future 
if novartis or other companies were to successfully bring legal actions against the company claiming patent or other intellectual property right infringements  in addition to any liability for damages  the company could be enjoined by a court from selling such products or processes and might be required to obtain a license to manufacture or sell the affected product or process 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such action or that the company could obtain any license required under any such patent on acceptable terms 
in particular  in the case of cyclosporine  the company believes that no license would be available on acceptable terms 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have experienced significant litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if the company becomes involved in such litigation with respect to cyclosporine or any other product  it could consume a substantial portion of the company s financial and human resources  regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
see business patents and proprietary technology and risk factors risks associated with cyclosporine 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how which it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the company has registered or applied for registration of the names of most of its products under development or commercialized for research and development use 
however  there can be no assurance that any trademark registration will be granted or not challenged by competitors 
see business patents and proprietary technology 
substantial competition 
the drugs being developed by the company compete with existing and new drugs being created by pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostics companies and universities 
many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities  as well as substantial marketing  manufacturing  financial and managerial resources and represent significant competition for the company 
the principal factors upon which the company s products compete are product utility  therapeutic benefits  ease of use  effectiveness marketing  distribution and price 
the company believes it competes favorably with respect to all of these factors 
with respect to thymoglobulin  cyclosporine and azathioprine  the company will be competing against large companies that have significantly greater financial resources and established marketing and distribution channels for competing products 
the drug industry is characterized by intense price competition and the company anticipates that it will face this and other forms of competition 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that the company will be able to keep pace with technological developments 
many of the competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by the company and may be more effective and less costly 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and obtaining regulatory approvals of such products 
accordingly  the company s competitors may succeed in commercializing products more rapidly than the company 
for example  the company believes that the degree of market penetration of its cyclosporine drug candidate is dependent in part on whether the company is the first company to market a bioequivalent formulation of cyclosporine 
the company believes that other companies may be developing cyclosporine formulations that may be marketed as generic equivalents 
were these competitors to develop their products more rapidly and complete the regulatory process sooner  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
treatments for the problems associated with transplantation that the company s products seek to address are currently available 
for example  sandimmune and neoral  marketed by novartis would compete with cyclosporine 
additionally  orthoclone okt  marketed by johnson johnson  atgam  marketed by pharmacia upjohn inc  and zenapax  marketed by roche ltd 
would be competitive with thymoglobulin 
prograf  marketed by fujisawa pharmaceutical co 
ltd  cellcept  marketed by roche ltd 
and imuran  marketed by glaxo wellcome ltd 
would be competitive with cyclosporine and azathioprine 
all of the aforementioned competitive and other drugs are commercially available for use as immunosuppressive drugs and are widely prescribed 
to the extent these therapeutics  monitoring products or novel transplant procedures address the problems associated with transplantation on which the company has focused  they may represent significant competition 
see business competition 
limited manufacturing capability 
the company lacks facilities to manufacture any of its drug candidates in accordance with current good manufacturing practices prescribed and strictly enforced by the fda 
the company generally relies on third parties to manufacture its compounds for clinical trials  including thymoglobulin  cyclosporine  azathioprine  celsior and allotrap and has contracted or expects to contract for commercial production of these compounds 
the company has an agreement with pmc under which it intends to obtain thymoglobulin for clinical trials and commercial use 
there can be no assurance that pmc or other manufacturers will meet fda standards governing good manufacturing practices gmp or other regulatory guidelines  that any ela s required for manufacturing will be filed  reviewed and approved  or that any third party manufacturer will pass a preapproval inspection 
the company is currently purchasing allotrap for clinical trials from ucb bioproducts sa ucb located in belgium  and intends to contract with ucb for commercial production 
the company is currently purchasing cyclosporine for clinical trials from gensia sicor under a contract which also provides for the production of commercial scale quantities 
the company has also entered into an agreement with eli lilly under which lilly has agreed to fill and finish bulk cyclosporine  provided by the company into the company s proprietary formulated cyclosporine drug product for subsequent commercial sale and distribution worldwide by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into secondary bulk material source contracts or successful secondary commercial scale manufacturing contracts or that any other third party arrangements can be established on a timely or commercially reasonable basis  or at all 
the company will depend on all such third parties to perform their obligations effectively and on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that such parties will perform and any failures by third parties may delay clinical development or submission of products for regulatory approval  or otherwise impair the company s competitive position which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  the manufacturing of drug candidates involves a number of technical steps and requires meeting stringent quality control specifications imposed by government regulatory bodies and by the company itself 
additionally  such products can only be manufactured in facilities approved by the applicable regulatory authorities 
because of these and other factors  the company may not be able to replace its manufacturing capacity quickly or efficiently in the event that its manufacturers are unable to manufacture their products at one or more of their facilities 
for certain of its potential products  the company will need to develop its production technologies further for use on a larger scale in order to conduct human clinical trials and produce such products for commercial scale at an acceptable cost 
to date  the company is manufacturing only two monitoring products in commercial quantities  pra stat and cross stat  which are being marketed by sangstat s direct sales force in europe and north america 
to be successful  the company s products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable cost 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing its monitoring products  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue production of its existing products and scale up production of future monitoring products to commercial levels 
in addition  some materials used in the company s products may be available only from sole suppliers 
there can be no assurance that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products or to conduct clinical trials 
limited marketing capability 
the company has a limited marketing and sales staff 
to the extent that the company itself undertakes to market a substantial portion of its products  or is unable to enter into co promotion agreements or to arrange for third party distribution of its products  additional expenditures  management resources and time will be required to develop a sales force 
currently  the company is developing a sales force in north america and intends to develop a sales force in europe to market its products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the establishment of a sales force or enter into co promotion or distribution agreements on terms favorable to the company or on a timely basis 
in addition  if the company succeeds in bringing products to market  it will compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s marketing and sales operations would compete successfully against such other companies 
the company has recently established the transplant pharmacy for the direct distribution by mail order of the company s products and services  as well as products and services of third parties 
establishing the transplant pharmacy as a viable distribution system entails a number of risks including the company s ability to enter into agreements with transplant centers to utilize the transplant pharmacy s services  compliance with state regulations regarding pharmacy licensing and compliance with federal and state laws regulating payments for referrals for health care services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing the transplant pharmacy as a viable distribution method for the company s products and services
