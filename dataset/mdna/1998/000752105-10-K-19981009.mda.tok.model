item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of abc s consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation should be read in conjunction with abc s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
abc s actual results could differ materially from the results expressed in  or implied by  such statements 
see regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations overview abc reported net income of million or per share on a diluted basis for the year ended july  as compared to net income of million or per share in and net income of million or per share in operating results for the year ended july  include a non cash  after tax charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for previously capitalized process reengineering costs 
operating results for the year ended july  also include an extraordinary charge of million for the early retirement of debt 
the diluted earnings per share effect of the accounting change and extraordinary item on abc s net income was to decrease diluted earnings per share by from to in  and to decrease diluted earnings per share by in from to 
net sales fiscal net sales increased million following a fiscal sales increase over fiscal of million 
sales of railcar wheels and wheel services increased million in fiscal  primarily resulting from an increased level of activity to support customers that build new railcars and increased production from abc s calera  alabama  railcar wheel manufacturing plant 
net sales of abc s track products division increased million in fiscal net sales of the systems division increased million in fiscal the systems division was formed with the acquisition of american systems technologies  inc in december the fiscal sales increase was primarily in the track products division million  and was predominately related to additional sales million associated with the may acquisition of deco industries inc and certain assets of deco automation and the december acquisition of american systems technologies 
sales of specialty trackwork products in fiscal were marginally above the prior year s sales 
the specialty trackwork product sales in fiscal were adversely affected by the merger induced slowdown of trackwork order releases from the western class i railroads 
sales at abc s calera wheel manufacturing plant were flat between fiscal and offsetting the recovery from the mid fiscal fire at the calera plant was an overall lower than normal level of capacity during due to disruptions caused by the implementation of process improvements at the facility 
gross profit and cost of sales gross profit increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in gross profit declined from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in the improvement in the gross profit margin in is primarily due to improved sales volumes in all major divisions and improved production at the calera  alabama  wheel plant 
the decrease in the gross profit margin from to was primarily due to the impact of disruptions to production caused by the implementation of major improvements to manufacturing operations  primarily at the calera  alabama  wheel plant 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from fiscal to fiscal the increase in expenses reflects additional expense in the customer support area field sales and customer service to meet the expanding needs of customers  the additional effort required to support abc s new information systems sap s r enterprise wide software and the increased level of incentive compensation payments for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from fiscal to fiscal the increase in was primarily in the customer support area for the reasons noted above 
other during fiscal  abc recorded a special pre tax charge of million 
the charge covered plant closure costs related to the joint venture with anchor brake shoe company  business process reengineering costs and additional taxes on products sold into mexico 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on abc s major construction projects  increased  or million  due primarily to overall higher level of outstanding debt  along with marginally higher interest rates 
interest expense increased million in over due primarily to an overall higher level of outstanding debt and higher average interest rates 
accounting change on november   the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus that companies must write off previously capitalized business process reengineering costs and expense future costs as incurred 
abc had capitalized certain process reengineering costs in prior fiscal years 
in accordance with this consensus  in fiscal  abc recorded a non cash  after tax charge of million to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
extraordinary item the extraordinary non cash  after tax charge of million in fiscal represents the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to previous indebtedness which was retired with proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes 
new accounting pronouncement in april  statement of position no 
was issued which requires that companies write off previously capitalized start up costs and expense future start up costs as incurred 
this new accounting rule must be adopted by abc by fiscal  but earlier adoption is encouraged 
abc has capitalized certain start up costs in prior periods  including million in fiscal year as of july   start up costs of million remain unamortized on abc s consolidated balance sheet 
such costs  and any other such new costs capitalized before abc adopts this new pronouncement will be written off as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the period of adoption 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations and debt have been the major sources of funds for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
abc has significantly increased the level of its capital expenditures in the last two fiscal years 
capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
major capital expenditures in the last two fiscal years include a new rail milling facility in chicago heights  illinois and a major upgrade of the machining operations at the calera  alabama  wheel plant 
during this time period  abc also invested capital on new computer equipment  enterprise wide software  and software installation which will substantially enhance abc s management information systems 
the rail mill is expected to begin commercial production in early fiscal year the improved calera facility is already operational 
most of the basic modules of the sap s r enterprise wide software system will be in operation by early fiscal year in fiscal year  abc also invested approximately million in a joint venture with china s ministry of railroads to build a railcar wheel manufacturing plant in china 
this joint venture began operations at the end of fiscal year in january  abc purchased certain patents for the manufacture and sale of heat treated and heat hardened rail in the us and canada 
abc is in the process of setting up a facility for the production of this product 
abc s investment for the patent rights and the production equipment will approximate million 
the plant is anticipated to begin production in early fiscal cash generated from operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the slight decline in cash generated by operating activities in was due to increased net earnings  offset by an increase in working capital requirements due to the increased level of business activity 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in earnings and the use of cash to support increased working capital requirements 
abc expects capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million in fiscal year abc has unused lines of credit totaling approximately million as of july  abc believes that its cash generated from operations for fiscal year and its lines of credit will be sufficient to fund the cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal reflect net borrowings under abc s revolving line of credit and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes  series b 
during fiscal  abc s credit agreement was amended and restated in conjunction with the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes 
under the amended credit agreement  certain loans and acquisitions facilities were paid in full  the revolving credit line was increased to million and terms of certain financial covenants were modified 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
seasonality the peak season for installation of specialty trackwork extends from march through october  when weather conditions are generally favorable for installation and  as a result  net sales of specialty trackwork have historically been more concentrated in the period from january through june  a period roughly corresponding to the second half of abc s fiscal year 
in addition  a number of abc s facilities close for regularly scheduled maintenance in the late summer and late december  which tends to reduce operating results during the first half of abc s fiscal year 
transit industry practice with respect to specialty track work generally involves the periodic shipment of large quantities  which may be unevenly distributed throughout the year 
abc did not experience any significant departure from the historical demand patterns during fiscal year issues the year yk problem refers to computer applications using only the last two digits to refer to a year rather than all four digits 
as a result  these applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather than the year in addressing the yk issues  abc has taken initiatives in three general areas information technology it and communication systems  non it systems and related third party issues 
the following is a summary of these programs 
it and communication systems since late  abc  in support of its long range strategic plans  has significantly upgraded and continues to upgrade its information technology and communication systems 
this upgrade includes enterprise wide application systems sap s r system  migration from midsize computers to client server based systems  upgraded personal computers pc s  upgraded pc software standardized on windows nt  windows x  microsoft exchange  microsoft office suite and back office applications software  sdrc ideas d cad and auto cad  local area networks lan s  wide area networks wan s  and network integration of advanced fax  printer  and advanced copier systems 
a by product of these endeavors is that a large portion of abc s it and non voice communication systems  and many of its voice communication systems are now yk compliant 
abc s exceptions to yk compliance are five of abc s nineteen plants are not yet converted to sap s r system  one hp mid size computer running yk non compliant software is not yet removed from operation  shop labor collection and pc support applications at certain plants are not yet yk compliant  certain auto cad sites are not yet yk compliant  edi systems are not fully compliant  certain pc s require bios and or operating system and application system upgrades  certain network hardware  mainly routers  require replacement  up to half of the phone systems pbx s at abc s plants need to be upgraded or replaced based on an assessment of of the pbx systems to date  and other intelligent office equipment in a stand alone mode such as fax machines  copiers  printers  etc 
may not be yk non compliant 
these issues are anticipated to be remediated by the middle of calendar year non it systems internal non it systems comprised mainly of building air management systems  elevator systems  security and fire control systems  safety systems  equipment and machinery operating and control systems  compressed air  electrical and natural gas systems  and equipment such as lift trucks  mobile cranes  etc  are being assessed by third party consultants specializing in yk compliance and remediation planning 
this assessment will be completed by december  and remediation is expected to be completed by june third parties abc has third party relationships with approximately large railroad and railcar customers  raw materials suppliers and suppliers of financial and outsourced investor and employee information and management services 
most of these third parties are publicly traded corporations subject to disclosure requirements 
abc is presently engaged in ongoing discussions and evaluations of these third parties yk readiness  while simultaneously advising them of abc s readiness 
abc intends to begin monitoring yk disclosures in sec filings of these third parties commencing with the current quarter filings 
major customers referred to above report having had yk compliance programs running for at least one to two years and indicate that their systems that interact with abc are or will be compliant for yk 
based on discussions with these customers  assessment of the customers capability  and long time customer operating practices  abc believes that these key customers will be yk compliant in all material matters affecting abc 
abc will continue to monitor its customers yk compliance 
abc is also in ongoing discussion with key suppliers of outsourced services including  but not limited to  stock transfer  debt servicing  payroll  banking collection and disbursements  and benefit programs 
at this time  abc has concluded that all material suppliers of these services are or will be yk compliant by the end of calendar abc will continue to monitor their yk compliance 
with the exception of rail products purchased from the large aforementioned suppliers  other raw materials mainly railroad ties  miscellaneous steel plate and bar  fasteners  scrap steel and foundry supplies are purchased from numerous small suppliers who abc believes are able to manually execute their business and are readily replaceable 
abc has concluded there is no material risk of being unable to procure these needed raw materials 
the specific yk it and communication system remediation tasks previously outlined are being accomplished by in house is and user personnel whose costs are recorded as normal operating expense 
the it system software upgrades are being executed under ongoing maintenance and support agreements with software vendors  and the bios upgrades to certain hardware are being executed under similar arrangements with hardware vendors 
the replacement cost of non remediable pc s will not be material 
network hardware component replacement costs  along with copiers and fax machine replacement costs  will also not be material 
abc is not yet in a position to estimate the cost of non it system and third party compliance issues  but has no reason to believe  based upon its evaluations done to date  that such costs  in the aggregate  would be material 
yk risks the principal risks to abc relating to the completion of its compliance conversion efforts related to its it and communications systems are 
inability to recruit and or retain key staff 

failure to complete sap s r system installation in the five remaining plants 

failure to replace non compliant edi systems 

failure to replace non compliant labor data collection systems 
abc believes that adequate replacements for non compliant network components  pc s  copiers  fax machines and pbx s are commercially available at reasonable prices and in good supply 
abc believes that adequate time and resources are available to remediate these areas as needed 
abc is attempting to quantify the principle it and communication systems risks at this time 
areas that could be affected include  but are not limited to  the ability to obtain and process orders and or retain certain material customers if edi is not remediated  operate plants not having yk functional it production systems  develop adequate product costs in the event of labor data collection system failures  and maintain and operate abc s it and communication systems lacking adequate staff resources 
the principal risks to abc relating to non it systems are failures in control systems for significant machines and equipment or facility systems 
these risks are presently under assessment and are expected to be completed by december  until this assessment is completed  abc has no basis to form an estimate of remediation problems  costs or difficulties  and cannot estimate the potential costs of such issues at this time 
the principal risks to abc in its relationship with third parties are 
failure of third party systems used to conduct such third parties business including customers  rail suppliers and suppliers of financial and outsourced investor and employee information and management services 

failure to implement compliant edi systems with key customers 
based on yk compliance work done to date  abc believes its key customers are currently yk compliant or will be yk compliant in all material respects and that service suppliers will be yk compliant or can be replaced within an acceptable time frame 
abc has or will obtain compliance certification from suppliers of key services as soon as such certifications are available 
other than rail supplied by key customers  abc currently believes that other raw materials do not pose a significant risk 
contingency plans abc intends to deal with contingency planning during the latter part of its second fiscal quarter of fiscal  after the results of the assessment and remediation in progress have been ascertained 
abc s description of its yk compliance issue is based upon information obtained by abc through evaluations of abc s it communication systems and customer and supplier yk compliance 
no assurance can be given that abc will be able to address the yk issues for all of its software and applications in a timely manner or that it will not encounter unexpected difficulties or significant expenses relating to adequately addressing the yk issue 
if abc or the major customers or suppliers with whom abc does business fail to address adequately the yk issues  or abc fails to successfully integrate or convert its computer systems generally  abc s business or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
regarding forward looking statements the foregoing outlook contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from current expectations due to a number of factors  including general economic conditions  competitive factors and pricing pressures  shifts in market demand  the performance and needs of industries served by abc s businesses  actual future costs of operating expenses such as rail and scrap steel  self insurance claims and employee wages and benefits  actual costs of continuing investments in technology  the availability of capital to finance possible acquisitions and to refinance debt  the ability of management to implement abc s strategy of acquisitions  rebuilding and process improvements  and the risks described from time to time in abc s sec reports 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk abc s market risk sensitive instruments do not subject abc to material market risk exposures  except as such risks relate to interest rate fluctuations 
as of july   abc has long term debt outstanding with a carrying value of million 
the estimated fair value of this debt is million 
abc historically has not entered into interest rate protection agreements 
fixed interest rate debt outstanding as of july  represents of total debt  carries an average interest of and matures as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million thereafter 
variable interest rate debt outstanding as of july  had an average interest rate at that date of and matures as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million thereafter
