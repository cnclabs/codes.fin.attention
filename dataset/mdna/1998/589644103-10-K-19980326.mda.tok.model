item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the year has been a period of positioning for meridian insurance group  inc new product enhancements  systems automation  and underwriting programs implemented during enable the company to move forward into with renewed momentum 
rate action taken in for several lines of business should help to improve loss ratio results for the company continually evaluates rate adequacy for all lines of business 
the company recently began to integrate the citizens security claims operations with the home office claims division 
this integration is expected to reduce overall claims related expenses while providing high quality service 
the company is also focused on reducing its expense ratio with a stringent review of all underwriting expenses 
automation continues to play an integral part in positioning the company for future success 
during the company completed development of an automated personal lines underwriting system for the homeowners and auto lines of business 
this allows risks that meet specific underwriting parameters to be processed by the system with little or no manual intervention 
the system will kick out policies that fail the underwriting criteria 
by allowing those policies with good experience to pass through the system  the company s underwriters can concentrate their review on those policies that have loss experience or exposure beyond the specified parameters  thereby allocating more of their time to those risks that need additional analysis 
it is anticipated that such underwriting and workflow enhancements will enable the company to expand its business without increasing the employee base 
the company continues to examine new ways for automation to enhance the workflow processes and increase overall efficiency 
the year automation issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
by early  the company s year project plan was developed and change efforts were underway 
both internal and external resources are utilized in reprogramming  replacing  and or testing the software for year modifications 
much progress has been made and the company expects its core business processing system to be completely year compliant before the end of the company estimates it has incurred incremental costs to address the year issue of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
estimates of incremental costs to complete the project in are  the company has initiated communications with its agents to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those parties potential failure to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of agents or other third parties will be timely converted  or that a widespread failure to convert by others would not adversely affect the company 
the company does not issue insurance policies covering risks related to the year issue 
however  there can be no certainty regarding future judicial or legislative interpretations of coverage 
during  meridian mutual became licensed in the state of washington and launched a new direct response marketing effort for private passenger automobile products 
this direct response program represents meridian s initial efforts to supplement its distribution channels 
historically  meridian has sold insurance only through its strong independent agency force 
during the start up phase  the direct response business will be conducted only in meridian mutual and will be excluded from the reinsurance pooling agreement with its affiliates 
affinity marketing relationships with banking or other financial institutions are expected to evolve  creating additional distribution vehicles 
during the s  premium writings for non standard automobile insurers generally enjoyed greater growth and profitability than the standard automobile marketplace 
effective january  meridian mutual began offering a non standard automobile product in the state of indiana 
initial response from the company s independent agency force was positive  as many of these agents have been writing non standard automobile products through other insurers 
the non standard product is expected to be offered in as many as eight states over the course of similar to the direct response business  non standard automobile writings will be retained by meridian mutual outside of the reinsurance pooling agreement during the start up phase 
the company continues to focus on its core business  while remaining competitive in the dynamic marketplace

the company s largest source of revenue  net earned premiums  increased percent in to million compared to million for aside from the percent increase in premium volume that resulted from the citizens security group acquisition  premiums earned by the meridian operation increased approximately percent  or million  over the total 
the meridian growth was attributed to nearly all lines of business  with personal lines production increasing percent  commercial lines percent and farmowners achieving growth of percent in earned premium volume 
commercial and personal automobile and homeowners were the primary lines of business contributing to the increased premium volume 
depressing the commercial lines growth was a reduction of approximately million in assumed earned premiums from the national workers compensation pool 
net investment income of million in increased percent over s total of million 
the pre tax net investment yield declined slightly to percent from percent in the reduced portfolio yield resulted primarily from a greater proportion of assets being invested in equity securities and tax exempt bonds

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for liquidity is to pay shareholder dividends  and its main source of liquidity is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations which restrict their ability to pay dividends 
during  meridian security declared and paid dividends to the company of million 
in and  dividends paid to the company were million and million  respectively 
the principal need of the company s insurance subsidiaries for liquid funds is the payment of claims and general operating expenses in the ordinary course of business 
the funds of the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate cash to pay such claims and expenses without forced sales of investments 
the average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is approximately years 
over the next year  a relatively small portion of the company s bond portfolio is scheduled to mature

approximately percent of the company s investment assets are held in fixed maturities  substantially all of which are believed to be readily marketable 
within the fixed maturity portfolio  the company holds approximately percent in mortgage backed pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has attempted to reduce the prepayment risks associated with mortgage backed securities by investing a majority of the collateralized mortgage obligations in planned amortization and very accurately defined tranches

at year end  the company recorded unrealized gains on the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
the company s equity security portfolio  which accounts for approximately percent of invested assets  produced unrealized gains  net of deferred income taxes  of approximately million in  compared to approximately million in net unrealized appreciation of investments added to the company s book value per share at december  net unrealized appreciation added per share to the book value at december  on may   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  common shares  or approximately five percent of the company s outstanding common stock

in july  the company completed the acquisition of citizens security group inc of red wing  minnesota 
the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of citizens security group inc and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  citizens fund insurance company and insurance company of ohio  for approximately million in cash  including capitalized acquisition costs  and became affiliated with citizens security mutual insurance company 
approximately percent of the purchase price was generated from the sale of a portion of the company s investment portfolio 
the remaining million was financed through bank debt and is being amortized over seven years with a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess cost over the fair value of the net assets of approximately million was recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
beginning in  state insurance regulators required companies to calculate risk based capital rbc 
rbc is the capital required to cover the varying degrees of risk inherent in a company s assets  loss reserves  underwriting  and reinsurance 
the company action level rbc is the minimum amount of capital required in order to avoid regulatory action 
in  the adjusted capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries was well above the required minimum 
impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses is known 
the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation in establishing rates  subject to limitations imposed for competitive pricing 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are management s estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of inflation  the normally higher investment yields available may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
