another example is the market for software localization and technical translations services  an area in which the company s translations segment is a global leader 
this market has increased rapidly as software programs have proliferated and have been translated into numerous language versions  and as the company s customers have increasingly outsourced the software localization process

to complement its live instruction  the company has increasingly used technology  such as cd rom  video and audio tools  to enhance its traditional teaching programs while reducing teaching costs 
the company has also increased its emphasis on more profitable semi private and group lessons  and has increased the number of company owned language center locations  adding new berlitz language centers and deleting over the three year period ended december  to further increase its market presence  the company has utilized franchising and joint ventures in emerging and secondary markets

an integrated inventory control system is expected to go live in early new analytical tools have been developed and a new business plan has been articulated to customers and partners in all key markets 
geographically  the majority of the company s subsidiaries are located outside the united states  with operations conducted in their respective local currencies 
for the three years ended december   the percentage of total revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars averaged  in foreign currencies including the japanese yen  the german mark  the irish punt  the british pound and the french and swiss francs

furthermore  in the north america division  approximately half of els berlitz on campus annual proforma revenue for the year ended december  originated from the far east 
due to this geographic presence in asia  the company is exposed to the economic turmoil affecting the asian region at the end of  and management is therefore proactively focusing on action steps designed to mitigate any future impact 
these include implementing cost control measures  maximizing economies of scale  and intensifying emphasis on revenues generation from the company s other geographic divisions
