income from operations the company s operations  as well as those of the building material industry generally  have reflected substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of various factors  including levels of construction activity  general regional and local economic conditions  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates and the availability of credit  all of which are cyclical in nature 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
because a substantial percentage of the company s sales are attributable to building professionals  certain of these factors may have a more significant impact on the company than on companies more heavily focused on consumers 
the company s first quarter and  occasionally  its fourth quarter are adversely affected by weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
the extent of such decreases in activity is a function of the severity of winter conditions 
record setting snow falls throughout the midwest and northeast in january of  adversely affected construction activity in the first quarter of weather conditions in were relatively normal throughout the year 
during the first quarter of  the company experienced mild winter weather conditions in the company s midwest region  which was partially offset by increased precipitation in the northeast and south

the company currently has excess availability under its revolving credit facility and anticipates that funds provided by operations and under this facility will be adequate for the company s future needs 
on february   in conjunction with the new revolving credit agreement  the company terminated its interest rate swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement

the company s ability to use certain of the nols carried forward  approximately million  will be subject to the limitations of section of the internal revenue code 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
year the year problem relates to the inability of certain computer programs and computer hardware to properly handle dates after december  as a result businesses may be at risk for miscalculations and systems failures 
in response to the year issue  the company initiated a project in early to identify  evaluate and implement changes to its existing computerized business systems 
an inventory was developed of all items of concern including vehicles  manufacturing equipment  and security  heating and electrical systems 
upon completion of the inventory a plan was developed to evaluate the importance of each item  the remediation necessary to make the item compliant either modification or replacement  the resources necessary to complete the remediation  and a time frame for completion 
the plan was then reviewed by an outside party for completeness 
the plan also includes the steps the company is taking to ensure it is not at risk for problems that may occur at its suppliers or customers 
the company has surveyed its customers  suppliers  and other service providers to determine whether they are actively involved in projects to ensure that their products and business systems will be year compliant 
management is currently reviewing their responses and evaluating alternatives for those that are not sufficiently addressing the year issue 
the company is addressing its software  hardware  and equipment issues through a combination of modifications to existing programs and conversions to year compliant software and equipment 
the company believes that it is currently complete with hardware and equipment related remediation or replacement efforts  and complete in software remediation or replacement 
the company s plan is to be totally compliant by september of certain systems  which have critical dates prior to september  are scheduled for earlier completion dates or have been completed 
at the present time the remediation process is proceeding as planned and there are no significant delays expected 
the estimated total cost of the project is expected to be million 
 of this cost is for the replacement of systems and equipment which was accelerated due to the year problem  and which will be capitalized over the systems estimated useful life 
through february of the company has expended a total of million on year remediation 
if modifications and conversions  by the company and those it conducts business with  are not made in a timely manner  the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s greatest risk at this time is with its store operating and accounts receivable systems and its inventory suppliers 
if the store operating system has problems the company could experience disruption in its basic distribution operations 
a problem with the company s accounts receivable system could cause some short term working capital and cash flow problems until the issue is resolved 
while the company has extended efforts to receive assurances that its product suppliers are adequately addressing this issue  the company expects there will be some minimal interruptions in replenishment from some suppliers  but these should be addressed quickly through alternative sources 
the company has evaluated each problem area for various contingency responses to mitigate any disruption should remediation be incomplete 
at present senior management is reviewing critical items to ensure there is at least one workable alternative to each of its key processes including inventory replenishment  sales and accounts receivable  payroll  and manufacturing and delivery equipment 
milestones for completion of critical systems are being closely monitored to minimize the chances of a year failure in the key processes 
in addition  a plan is being developed to produce backup documents and reports  of critical information  at december  and for process and system testing to occur on january and  to identify and address any unforeseen issues prior to the opening of business on january the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for a year failure would involve a brief interruption of the company s primary field systems application 
given the high level of in house expertise in the development and maintenance of this system  the expectation is that any such failure would involve at worst a several day delay in processing 
the company has  and will continue to spend a great deal of resources to ensure that this system is compliant and will not be impacted by a year failure 
as a contingency for a failure scenario  though  the company has arranged for the printing of key documents sales orders scheduled for the next week  special orders placed with suppliers  pricing masters  etc 
on december  at each location  which would allow the operations to continue to operate  on a manual basis  for at least two weeks before there would be a serious impairment to the business 
in addition  key systems and operating staff will be brought in on january and  days on which the operating facilities are scheduled to be closed  to perform system testing of the field applications and check operating equipment  utilities and other systems 
the company can and has applied program changes to all sales and distribution facilities in a matter of hours 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and lumber futures contracts 
on february  the company entered into a new revolving credit agreement with a group of financial institutions 
the new revolving line of credit provides for  subject to certain restrictions  up to million of revolving credit loans and the issuance of up to million of letters of credit

after that time  depending upon the company s rolling four quarter interest coverage ratio  amounts outstanding under the new revolving line of credit will bear interest at a spread above the base rate of from to or from to above the applicable libor rate 
based on the company s average borrowings under it s revolving credit agreement  subject to the effect of the interest rate swap agreement described below  a basis point movement in the base rate or libor rate would result in an approximate  annualized increase or decrease in interest expense 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein

this new agreement effectively fixed the interest rate at subject to adjustments in certain circumstances for three years  on million of the company s borrowings under its floating rate revolving line of credit 
unlike the prior agreement  this interest rate swap has no provisions for termination based on changes in the day libor borrowing rate 
at march  the day libor borrowing rate was

all futures contracts are purchased to protect long term pricing commitments on specific future customer purchases 
while lumber futures contracts are entered on a risk management basis  the company s hedge positions could show a net gain or loss depending on prevailing market conditions 
at december  the company had lumber futures contracts outstanding with a total market value of  and a net unrealized gain of  these contracts all mature in
