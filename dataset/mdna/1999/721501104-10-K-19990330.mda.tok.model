year considerations general many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs  if not corrected  could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year  thereby causing disruptions in the operations of the company and its suppliers and customers 
this year issue is believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations  including the company 
state of readiness systems replacement project in  the company began a project aimed at improving its access to business information through common  integrated computing and reporting systems 
in  prior to the company s acquisition of fieldcrest cannon in december  fieldcrest cannon began a similar systems replacement project 
each of the company and fieldcrest cannon  in connection with its systems replacement project  elected to implement systems using software applications principally developed by oracle corporation oracle to fulfill its business systems replacement needs 
such software applications replace many of the accounting  reporting and manufacturing systems that are or previously had been in place at the company and fieldcrest cannon 
additionally  each of the company and fieldcrest cannon  in connection with its systems replacement project  identified certain other payroll  manufacturing and warehousing systems to be replaced with software applications from other vendors 
the company believes that the software applications purchased in connection with these business replacement projects are year compliant 
following the acquisition of fieldcrest cannon  the independent systems replacement projects of the company and fieldcrest cannon were combined  and the combined project the systems replacement project is ongoing with an estimated completion date during the third quarter of fiscal year the extension of the estimated completion date from the company s previous estimate of june is due primarily to acquisitions made in the latter half of fiscal year as well as software customizations required at certain of the company s facilities  both of which have broadened the original scope of the project 
it is estimated that over of the development of the oracle software applications is complete  with the implementation of the financial application having been substantially completed as of october the company s payroll conversion was completed during the first quarter of fiscal year the manufacturing and warehousing applications require unique customization to meet the specific needs of each plant  therefore  the development and implementation of this software is expected to continue into the third quarter of fiscal year year plan in addition to the systems replacement project  the company  as part of its year compliance program  has developed a specific plan the year plan to help ensure that the company is not adversely affected by the year issue 
the year plan is divided into the following four major components each  a component information technology systems it systems  information technology infrastructure it infrastructure  process control and instrumentation pc i  and third party suppliers and customers external agents 
the year plan is being implemented with respect to each component in the following six general phases inventory year items  assign priorities to identified items  assess the impact of items determined not to be year compliant  convert or replace material items that are determined not to be year compliant  test material items  and design and implement contingency and business continuation plans for each location 
additionally  the company retained an independent third party  in the first quarter of fiscal year  to review the company s year plan and make recommendations as needed 
this study is underway with the results to be provided to the company during the second quarter of fiscal year for purposes of the year plan  material items are those believed by the company to have a risk involving the safety of individuals  and that may cause damage to property or the environment or significantly impair the company s ability to manufacture and ship its products 
the inventory and priority assessment phases were completed with respect to each component of the year plan in may the remainder of the year plan is ongoing  the majority of which will be completed during the third quarter of fiscal year however  the company will continue to monitor  review and perform testing in each phase through the end of fiscal year it systems 
it systems are comprised primarily of applications software 
the company s applications software is being remediated primarily through the systems replacement project 
applications software that is not remediated through the systems replacement project and is not year compliant is being converted internally through the use of custom programming or replaced by the supplier of such software 
the company estimates that the conversion phase with respect to it systems was approximately complete as of february and the remaining conversions will be completed during the third quarter of fiscal year the company s estimate remains at due to the software customizations and the additional requirements in converting the newly acquired businesses discussed above 
the testing phase with respect to converted software is ongoing and will continue through the end of fiscal year vendor software replacements and upgrades are on schedule for completion by june for the majority of the plant conversions  however  certain vendor software upgrades will not be complete until the third quarter of fiscal year the testing phase with respect to replacement software is conducted as the software is replaced and will continue through the end of the year 
contingency planning with respect to it systems is ongoing with high level planning expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year detailed refinement of these plans will continue into the third and fourth quarters  as other system conversions are completed 
it infrastructure 
it infrastructure consists of hardware and systems software other than applications software 
the implementation of the year plan with respect to it infrastructure is on schedule  and the company estimates that approximately of the scheduled activities with respect to it infrastructure had been completed as of february as discussed above  the company s estimate remains at  due to software customizations and acquisitions broadening the scope of the project 
this component is expected to be substantially complete during the third quarter of fiscal year the testing phase will continue as the it infrastructure is remediated  upgraded or replaced 
contingency planning with respect to it infrastructure is ongoing with development and enhancement continuing through the end of the year 
pc i 
pc i involves the hardware  software and associated embedded computer chips that are used in the operation of the company s facilities 
plans detailing the tasks and resources required to implement the year plan with respect to pc i are in place 
the company estimates that over of the pc i vendors have responded to questionnaires indicating their equipment is year compliant  and have reported non compliance 
the non compliant systems have been remediated or are undergoing remediation 
however  the company continues to assess the needs of its newly acquired facilities and expects completion during the third quarter of fiscal year contingency planning with respect to pc i is ongoing and will be based primarily on the results of tests expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year external agents 
the external agents component of the year plan involves identifying and prioritizing critical business partners at the direct interface level and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year issue 
detailed evaluations of the most critical third parties have been initiated 
the company is developing contingency plans based upon these evaluations 
contingency planning will continue with the company s business partners throughout fiscal year the company believes the development and implementation of this component of the year plan is on schedule as of february costs to address the business system replacements and year to date  the company estimates it has spent million of capital on the systems replacement project of which a portion relates to expenditures made prior to the merger 
it is estimated that an additional million of capital spending will be incurred in to complete the systems replacement project 
expenses incurred to complete remediation of the year plan are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company believes operating cash flows will be adequate to fund any remaining expenditures related to the systems replacement project and the year plan and does not anticipate these needs having a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
risks associated with the company s year issues the company s failure to resolve year issues on or before december  could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  send and or receive e mail and voice mail  or engage in similar normal business activities 
additionally  failure of third parties  upon whom the company s business relies  to timely remediate their year issues could result in disruption of the company s supply of materials and parts  late  missed or unapplied payments  temporary disruptions in order processing and other general problems related to the company s daily operations 
while the company believes the year plan will adequately address the company s internal year issues  until the company receives responses from all significant business partners  the overall risks associated with the year issue remain difficult to accurately assess and quantify  and there can be no assurances that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
see additional disclosures about interest rate swap agreements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company has not experienced any significant changes in market risk since january  the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin 
to lower or limit overall borrowing costs  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of portions of its outstanding debt 
the interest rate swap agreements generally have one to two year terms 
the agreements entitle the company to receive or pay to the counterparty a major bank  on a quarterly basis  the amounts  if any  by which the company s interest payments covered by swap agreements differ from those of the counterparty 
these amounts are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreements and changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the annual impact on the company s results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately million irrespective of any swaps associated with this debt 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is due primarily to a foreign subsidiary domiciled in canada 
the company s canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the canadian subsidiary is not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  the impact of a change in the exchange rate at january  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
