item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations review net sales all dollar amounts in thousands net sales    percent increase for the twelve months ended december   net sales were a record million  million over net sales of million 
total shipments of the company s three operating groups printing writing  specialty paper  towel tissue were also a record  tons in  an increase of from the  tons shipped in shipments were  tons in revenue and shipment growth in and was aided by the acquisitions of b j supply and otis specialty papers 
selling prices for the company s products declined in both and due to competitive pressures on several products in the company s printing and writing  specialty  and towel and tissue grades 
shipments at the printing writing group were similar for and b j supply and the converted products facilities recorded increases in while the paper manufacturing facilities decreased approximately 
a major portion of this decrease was a decision not to participate in certain commodity grades due to poor selling prices 
premium paper sales increased and enhanced overall product mix  although  downward pressure on paper prices resulted in lower sales dollars for the group 
overall group shipments were higher in compared to all operating facilities within the group recorded gains in over continued mix improvement and volume gains will be a focus for shipments were a record at the specialty paper group for total tonnage of  increased over tonnage of  the major portion of the increase was attributable to the otis facility  which was acquired in may of volume in was greater than with the major portion of that increase also attributable to the otis acquisition 
competitive market pressures in both and resulted in lower selling prices on a year over year comparison 
the specialty paper group experienced softening in demand in both and  which resulted in limited downtime for both years 
the focus for will be to improve product mix in particular for the sorg and otis facilities where machine capabilities were or will be enhanced 
the towel tissue group continued its record volume growth in volume has increased   and for the last three years on a year over year comparison 
this volume growth has principally been accomplished by increasing distributors and adding converting lines 
average pricing declined in over the prior year s average while was slightly below order backlog at the end of approximated  tons for all operating groups and was less than in in backlogs had increased over principally due to acquisitions 
order backlog totals do not necessarily indicate the business strength entirely since a substantial percentage of orders are shipped directly from inventory upon receipt 
gross profit on sales all dollar amounts in thousands gross profit on sales    percent increase decrease gross profit margin gross profit decreased to million or of net sales in compared to a gross profit of million or of net sales 
gross profit was million in or of net sales 
the negative impact of reduced selling prices principally caused the margin decline in while selling prices declined in  gross margins remained similar to due to offsetting lower raw material costs 
market prices for pulp  the primary raw material used in manufacturing paper  declined during in  the average list price of northern bleached softwood kraft  a frequently used benchmark pulp grade  decreased from the level compared to an and decrease in and  respectively 
wastepaper prices  the primary raw material used in the production of toweling and tissue  increased in over average prices and had increased in a comparison of to the printing writing group s mills operated near capacity in and total tons produced were similar for both and paper production increased in and in over the previous year 
increases were principally attributable to capital and operational improvements 
other facilities within the group reported year over year increases for all years presented 
inventory levels increased in due in part to stocking a new west coast warehouse facility in late the specialty paper group mills operated near capacity for all years presented 
softening demand and poor market conditions resulted in nominal downtime in both and at the otis and rhinelander facilities 
overall production declined in compared to principally due to product mix 
this product mix was offset somewhat due to the acquisition of the otis facility 
production levels increased both for and on a previous year comparison 
product mix  capital improvements  and the otis acquisition all were factors contributing to the increases 
inventory levels declined approximately in converting production at the towel tissue group increased similarly to its sales volume growth for all years presented 
inventory levels approximated  tons at the end of and increased  tons over labor a new five year labor agreement with the united paperworkers international union at the groveton mill was successfully negotiated in the new agreement became effective april  and included a general wage increase of in  in both and  in and in a new four year labor agreement was also successfully negotiated in with the united paperworkers international union at sorg 
the new agreement  which became effective november   includes a general wage increase of in  in both and and in labor agreements in other facilities expire in  and the company maintains good labor relations in all facilities 
operating expenses all dollar amounts in thousands selling and administrative    percent increase decrease restructuring and merger   total operating expense    percent increase as a percent of net sales selling  administrative and research expenses  excluding the merger and restructuring expenses discussed below were million in  compared to million in and million in during  decreases in the company s stock price resulted in a net million credit for stock appreciation rights  dividend equivalent and stock option discount expense  compared to charges in and of million and million  respectively

the after tax charge was million or 
per share for other income and expense all dollar amounts in thousands interest expense    percent increase decrease other  interest expense amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in interest expense was lower in principally due to lower interest rates and lower average debt levels 
interest expense in increased over due primarily to higher debt levels associated with the acquisitions of the otis and b j supply facilities 
capitalized interest totaled 
million  
million and million in  and  respectively 
fluctuations in capitalized interest are primarily dependent on varying levels of capital expenditures qualifying for capitalized interest criteria 
other income includes interest income of 
million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
the difference in other income and expense is primarily due to fluctuations in the gain or loss on asset sales and disposals

cash provided by operations was million in the increase in was primarily due to a decrease in receivables  reduced changes for investments in inventories and other assets  along with increases in accounts payable and other liabilities  all offset by reduced net earnings 
the reduction in cash flow for  compared to  was due mainly to an increase in working capital needs associated with higher accounts receivable and a smaller increase in accounts payable and other liabilities 
capital expenditures were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in capital spending in was due to general upgrades of pulp mills and paper machines resulting from business expansion opportunities following the merger with mosinee 
in  the printing writing group completed several projects at the groveton mill totaling million 
the projects consisted of paper machine upgrades and a stock blending system which provides better efficiency  faster and continuous furnish  less broke and a reduction in usage of higher cost fiber 
the brokaw mill spent million in on an million pulp mill distributive control system to improve pulp quality and reduce operating costs 
the specialty paper group completed several major projects in its pulp and paper mills  including spending million for rebuilds of the paper machines at the mosinee and sorg mills  million for a wet lap machine and million on a boiler precipitator at the mosinee mill 
the otis mill spent million on a million rebuild to its two paper machines 
the towel tissue group completed a building expansion project totaling million to increase operating plant and warehouse space by  square feet  million on additional towel and tissue converting lines and million to rebuild the paper machine for added toweling production capacity to keep pace with increasing sales volume 
the board of directors approved a number of major capital improvements in  on which spending will continue into a million rebuild to the otis mill s two paper machines was approved 
this project will expand the production capacity of the machines and add significant new manufacturing capabilities to give the specialty paper group an improved sales mix 
nearly million was approved for the towel tissue group to add converting lines for expanding sales volume 
other major capital improvement projects approved by the board of directors  include million for a woodroom modernization and million for a boiler precipitator at the mosinee mill  million for an upgrade to the dry end of the paper machines at the brokaw mill  to include winder  reels  repulper and automated guided vehicles for roll movement  and nearly million at the groveton mill for general upgrades and conversions 
at the end of  the company was committed to spend million to complete these capital projects and others currently under construction 
debt and equity all dollar amounts in thousands short term debt    long term debt    total debt    stockholders equity    total capitalization    long term debt capitalization ratio during  the company obtained two separate lines of credit which provided an additional million of available funds to assist in the authorized repurchase of company stock

the company plans to refinance the outstanding debt obligations to secure longer term financing in year year issues apply to the company s computerized manufacturing process controllers  environmental systems  order processing  inventory management  the shipment of finished goods  and internal financial and other information systems 
year issues also apply to the company s suppliers and customers 
for purposes of this discussion  the terms year issues or year problems  or terms of similar import  refer to the potential failure of computer applications as a result of the failure of a program or hardware to properly recognize the year and to properly handle dates beyond the year the term year readiness  or terms of similar import  mean that the particular equipment or processes referred to have been modified or replaced and the company believes that such modified or replaced equipment or processes will operate as designed after without year problems 
readiness the company has developed a year plan intended to upgrade its information technology hardware and software and all software and embedded technology applications in its equipment and facilities to be year ready  assess the year readiness of suppliers and customers  and develop contingency plans  if practical  for critical systems and processes 
the company has completed an inventory of mission critical information systems  process equipment  and manufacturing facilities 
the company continues to evaluate and test equipment  environmental controls  and other core functions 
assessment and testing is expected to be completed by may  the company believes that the most critical information systems  primarily the sales order processing  inventory  and shipping systems  are already year ready or  if not  that such systems have been given first priority to be made year ready and will be ready by september  the company s enterprise resource planning system erp is intended to bring the remainder of the company s information systems to year readiness by september  the broader  non year aspects of the erp system will be fully implemented in costs the costs of achieving year readiness have not been material to date and are not expected to be material 
the cost of remediation for key papermaking process controls and equipment is expected to be less than million 
internal costs for year readiness are not being tracked  but principally relate to payroll costs of company personnel 
the implementation of the company wide erp system is expected to require a capital investment of approximately million 
although the erp implementation timetable was not accelerated to address year issues  those issues were considered in determining the overall timetable for its implementation 
risks the company expects no material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations collectively  its business as a result of problems encountered in its own business as a result of year issues or as a result of the impact of year problems on its customers or vendors 
however  the risks to the company associated with year issues are many 
the company s assessment of possible year related problems depends  to some extent  on the assurances and guidance provided it by the suppliers of the technology as to its year readiness 
in addition  the company has limited ability to independently verify the possible effect of year problems on its customers and vendors 
therefore  the company s assumptions concerning the effect of year issues relies  in part  on its ability to analyze the business and operations of each of its critical vendors or customers 
this process is  by the nature of the problem  limited to such persons public statements  their responses to the company s inquiries  and the information available to the company from third parties concerning the industries or particular vendors or customers involved 
the company expects that year problems which cause customers to be unable to place orders would have a material adverse impact on its business only if the problem was widespread and long lived 
the company has a broad customer base  which would likely alleviate the adverse effects of isolated customer year problems 
some risk also exists that  despite the company s best efforts  critical manufacturing systems may malfunction due to year problems and curtail the manufacturing process 
the company does not anticipate such interruptions and it is unlikely any such curtailment would be lengthy 
with eleven manufacturing facilities  a temporary interruption at one facility is unlikely to have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
interruption of raw material supply due to supplier problems caused by year issues are not expected to be material as the company stocks raw materials to protect against supply problems and alternative sources of supply exist to meet the company s raw material needs 
similarly  although the company faces potential disruptions in its operations from year problems as a result of the failure of the power grid  telecommunications  or other abilities  it is not aware that any material disruption in these infrastructures is reasonably likely to occur and the number and widespread location of its facilities is likely to minimize the impact of any disruption 
contingency plan the company has evaluated various contingencies that may arise as a result of year issues 
the company anticipates that disruptions in production  sales  the supply of raw materials  loss of customer orders  and other foreseeable effects of the year issues can be addressed following normal business alternatives 
the company will continue to analyze and develop contingency plans where possible and not cost prohibitive
