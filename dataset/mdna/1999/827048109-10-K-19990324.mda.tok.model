item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general the company is a leading north american manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products that currently produces i steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  ii custom designed plastic containers for personal care  health  food  pharmaceutical and household detergent and chemical products and iii specialty packaging items used in the food and beverage industries  including steel caps and closures  aluminum roll on closures  plastic bowls  plastic cans and paperboard containers 
the company is the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a pro forma unit sale market share for the year ended december  of in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for personal care products and a major supplier of metal closures for food and beverage products 
see business general 
revenue growth the company s strategy is to increase shareholder value by growing its existing businesses and expanding into other segments by applying its expertise in acquiring  financing  integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses 
the company has increased its revenues and market share in the metal food container  plastic container and specialty packaging markets through acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result of this strategy  the company has diversified its customer base  geographic presence and product line 
management believes that certain industry trends exist which will enable the company to continue to acquire attractive businesses in its existing markets 
for example  during the past eleven years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations 
the company s acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte  agrilink and  most recently  campbell reflect this trend 
during this period  the company s overall share of the us metal food container market more than quadrupled  from approximately to approximately in on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the acquisition of cs can as if it had occurred on january  see business general growth strategy 
the company s plastic container business has also increased its market position from a sales base of million in to million in through strategic acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
the plastic container segment of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  and management intends to pursue consolidation opportunities in that segment as evidenced by its recent acquisitions of clearplass and winn 
see business general growth strategy 
management believes that it can successfully apply its acquisition and operating expertise to new segments of the consumer goods packaging industry 
for example  with the roll on closures and an can acquisitions  the company expanded its specialty packaging business into aluminum roll on closures  steel caps and closures and its licensed omni plastic container 
management believes that certain trends in and characteristics of the north american consumer goods packaging industry will continue to generate attractive acquisition opportunities in complementary business lines 
importantly  the industry is fragmented  with numerous segments and multiple participants in the various segments 
many of these segments are experiencing consolidation 
see business general growth strategy 
operating strategy the company seeks to acquire businesses at reasonable cash flow multiples and to enhance profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
the additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions have enabled the company to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings 
in addition  the company s acquisitions have enabled it to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and minimizing product transportation costs 
the company has also benefited from the economies of its increased purchasing volume and from the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions  as well as from the investment of capital to upgrade the acquired facilities 
see business general growth strategy enhance profitability of acquired companies 
historically  the company has been able to improve its operating margins through productivity and cost reduction opportunities provided by its acquisitions 
following an acquisition  the company will initiate a systematic program  which usually will be implemented over a number of years  to optimize its manufacturing facilities 
as a result  this improvement to operating margins generally has been realized over a number of years 
see capital resources and liquidity 
in addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses  the company has improved the operating performance of its existing plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
over the past five years  the company has made million in capital investments to improve its productivity  to reduce its manufacturing costs and to invest in new market opportunities 
for the period from through  the company s operating margins excluding the effect of non cash charges improved from to as a result of benefits realized from its plan to integrate an can and from the investment of capital for productivity improvements 
in  however  the company s operating margins declined to principally because the overall margin on sales to campbell was less than the average margin for the company s existing business 
the company operates in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
further  the multi year supply arrangements entered into by the company s metal food container businss with many of its customers  including nestle  del monte  campbell and several other major food producers  limit the company s ability to increase its margins 
the company estimates that approximately of its projected metal food container sales in will be pursuant to such arrangements 
these multi year supply arrangements generally provide  however  for the pass through of material and labor cost changes  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of the company s results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
see business raw materials 
historically  the company has been successful in continuing its multi year supply arrangements with its customers  without any resulting material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future the company will retain these multi year supply arrangements or  if the company continues these arrangements  that they will be continued without any material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the company and del monte agreed to extend the term of the dm supply agreement by three years until december  in return for certain price reductions which went into effect in the company believes that these price reductions  while significant  will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
see financial strategy 
the company believes that in the benefits to its operating margins realized from its cost reduction initiatives and capital investments are likely to offset the impact of the price reductions associated with the extension of the dm supply agreement and the lower average margin sales to campbell 
the company s metal food container business sales and  to a lesser extent  operating income are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable  tomato and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  the company has historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of its annual income from operations during these quarters 
the company believes that this seasonal impact will be mitigated somewhat by the acquisition of cs can 
management believes that sales to campbell generally will be highest in the first and fourth quarters due to the seasonal demand for soup products 
financial strategy the company s financial strategy is to use leverage to support its growth and increase shareholder returns 
the company s stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of its long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports its financial strategy 
as the company s revenues and operating income have increased and the company s financial position has improved  the company refinanced substantially all of its indebtedness in and with lower cost indebtedness and equity to further improve its cash flow and operating and financial flexibility 
in addition to reducing the company s borrowing costs and extending the maturities of its debt  the company s refinancings improved its flexibility to engage in mergers and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock and refinance existing indebtedness 
furthermore  the company s secured credit facilities provide it with revolving loan facilities of million  which are available to the company to provide for seasonal working capital needs and to pursue its growth strategy or for other permitted purposes 
see capital resources and liquidity 
during  the company used million of its revolving loan facilities to finance its acquisitions of winn  cs can and clearplass and to repurchase approximately million of its common stock 
even though the company incurred additional indebtedness in to finance acquisitions and common stock repurchases  the company s aggregate financing costs interest expense and preferred stock dividend requirements in declined approximately million from and million from these reductions reflected the benefit of the company s and refinancings 
see capital resources and liquidity 
to the extent the company utilizes its revolving loan facilities for acquisitions  stock repurchases or other permitted purposes in future periods  its interest expense may increase 
further  since the company s financial results are sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest  its interest expense may vary from period to period 
the company s revolving loan and term loan borrowings under its secured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates 
after taking into account interest rate swap arrangements that the company entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  the company had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
see effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
in light of the company s strategy to use leverage to support its growth and optimize shareholder returns  the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  the company s aggregate financing costs were of its income from operations as compared to and for and  respectively 
due to the company s significant interest expense  events such as price reductions given to customers in exchange for term extensions or other modifications to existing supply arrangements  as was agreed to with del monte for  that are not material to the company s income from operations could have a significant impact on its net income 
in  the company acquired winn  cs can and clearplass  and financed the entire purchase price for these acquisitions with revolving loan borrowings under its us bank credit facility and with other indebtedness 
these acquisitions were slightly accretive to the company s earnings per share  as their operating income was largely offset by interest expense on the indebtedness used to finance them 
consistent with the company s strategy to acquire businesses at reasonable cash flow multiples  management believes that the cash flow generated from these acquisitions will reduce the indebtedness used to finance them and the related interest expense 
in addition  management believes that it will be able to enhance the profitability of these acquisitions through cost reduction opportunities and capital investment  although there can be no assurance that their profitability will be enhanced 
to further enhance shareholder value  in the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company of up to million of its common stock 
in  the company repurchased million of its common stock  shares  and funded such repurchases with revolving loan borrowings from its us 
bank credit facility 
because such repurchases occurred in the second half of  they did not have a significant impact on the company s earnings per share in in  the company expects that such repurchases will be accretive to the company s earnings per share

capital resources and liquidity the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from its obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with its acquisitions and the refinancing of such indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of the company s seasonal working capital needs 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and revolving loan borrowings 
during and  the company refinanced substantially all of its indebtedness with lower cost indebtedness and equity to further improve its cash flow and operating and financial flexibility 
as a result  the company refinanced all of its discount debentures and notes and its higher cost bank facility with i proceeds received from the ipo  ii the company s debentures  iii the company s exchange debentures  and iv a lower cost bank facility 
in july  the company completed the refinancing of its existing bank facility by entering into a new us senior secured credit facility

because the company sells metal containers used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  it has seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  the company must access working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the summer and fall packing season 
seasonal accounts are generally settled by year end 
due to the company s seasonal requirements  the company incurs short term indebtedness to finance its working capital requirements 
the company utilizes its revolving loan facilities for seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and repurchases of its common stock 
for  the company estimates that at its peak it will utilize approximately million of its revolving loan facilities for seasonal working capital needs 
as a result  after taking into account outstanding revolving loans of million at december   the company estimates that approximately million of its revolving loan facilities is available to it in for acquisitions  repurchases of common stock and other permitted purposes 
the company financed its acquisitions of winn  cs can and clearplass through the revolving loan facility under its us senior secured credit facility 
see business recent developments 
revolving loan borrowings under the us senior secured credit facility will be due and payable on december  as of december   there were million of outstanding revolving loans under the us senior secured credit facility  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the unused portion of the revolving loan facility under the us senior secured credit facility at such date was million 
the company also financed repurchases of its common stock in with revolving loans from its us senior secured credit facility 
during  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company of up to million of its common stock 
since july  the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock including  shares repurchased in late march for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company intends to finance any future repurchases with revolving loans from its us senior secured credit facility 
in addition to its operating cash needs  the company believes its cash requirements over the next several years without taking into account the effect of future acquisitions will consist primarily of i annual capital expenditures of to million  ii annual principal amortization payments of bank term loans under its senior secured credit facilities beginning in of approximately million  million  million  million and million  iii expected total expenditures of approximately million over the next few years associated with plant rationalizations  employee severance and workforce reductions and other plant exit costs  iv the company s interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and acquisitions and bank term loans under its senior secured credit facilities  most of which bear fluctuating rates of interest  the debentures and the exchange debentures for which the company intends to make future interest payments in cash  and v payments of approximately million for federal and state tax liabilities in  which will increase annually thereafter 
as part of its plan to integrate and rationalize the acquired operations of an can  the company established a liability of million 
the company s plan consists primarily of closing or downsizing certain manufacturing plants and integrating the selling  general and administrative functions of the former an can operations with those of the company 
the company established reserves for planned costs  which included approximately million related to employee severance and relocation costs  million related to administrative workforce reductions and million related to plant exit costs and other acquisition liabilities 
since its acquisition of an can in august  the company incurred expenditures of million in  million in  million in and million in  of which an aggregate of million related to administrative workforce reductions and employee severance and relocation costs and million related to plant exit costs and other acquisition liabilities 
the timing of these plant rationalizations and other restructuring items has been dependent upon  among other things  the expiration of binding labor obligations assumed by the company in its acquisition of an can and complexities associated with moving production to other facilities and qualifying such facilities with customers to meet fda and such customers requirements 
accordingly  these costs will principally be incurred through in connection with its acquisitions of cs can  clearplass and winn  the company has developed plans to integrate these businesses into its operations by rationalizing certain of the acquired plant operations 
pursuant to these plans  the company has accrued liabilities of million  of which million relates to plant exit costs and other acquisition liabilities and million relates to employee severance and relocation costs 
during  in connection with these plans the company incurred million for plant exit costs and other acquisition costs and million for employee severance costs 
the timing of these rationalization activities is dependent upon  among other things  the time required to obtain necessary environmental permits and approvals in connection with a consent order with the us environmental protection agency to which the company is subject as a result of its acquisition of cs can and complexities associated with the transfer of the labor force of campbell for cs can to the company 
the company expects that principally all actions under these plans will be completed by the end of management believes that cash generated by operations and funds from the revolving loans available under the company s secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service and tax obligations for the foreseeable future 
the company is also continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market  and will likely incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under its us revolving loan facility  to finance any such acquisition 
the company s secured credit facilities and the indentures with respect to the debentures and the exchange debentures contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur debt  sell assets and engage in certain transactions 
management does not expect these limitations to have a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company is in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in such financing agreements and believes that it will continue to be in compliance during with all such covenants 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on the company  other than to increase its cost of borrowing 
in general  the company has been able to increase the sales prices of its products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials 
see business raw materials and sales and marketing 
because the company has indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  the company s financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   the company had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  taking into account interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest was exchanged for fixed rates of interest based on the three month libor rate  which rate ranges from to 
the notional principal amounts of these agreements totaled million  of which million matures in the first quarter of and the remainder matures in the last quarter of depending upon market conditions  the company may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in the company s judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge its exposure against interest rate volatility

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   and establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  requiring recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
as required  the company will adopt sfas no 
in the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
year issues since  the company has been in the process of reviewing its computer and operational systems to identify and determine the extent to which its systems will be vulnerable to potential errors and failures as a result of the year issue 
the year issue arises because many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the year and  as a result  may be unable to process accurately certain data before  during or after the year the year issue presents several risks to the company  such as i the company s internal systems may not function properly  ii suppliers computer and operational systems may not function properly and  consequently  deliveries of materials and supplies may be delayed  iii customers computer and operational systems may not function properly and  consequently  orders or payments for the company s products may be delayed  and iv the company s banks computer systems could malfunction  disrupting the company s orderly posting of deposits  funds  transfers and payments 
such a disruption at any point in the company s supply  manufacturing  processing  distribution or financial chains could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as a manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products  the products manufactured and sold by the company are unaffected by year issues since they contain no microprocessors or similar electronic components 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its internal computing infrastructure  business applications and shop floor systems are year compliant 
these systems assist in the control of the company s operations by performing such functions as processing financial data  maintaining manufacturing processes and assisting with facilities management and security 
many of these systems contain one or more microprocessors or other embedded electronic components that could be affected by year issues 
failure of some of these systems could result in significant business disruptions for the company 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company has initiated modifications to its internal computing infrastructure  business applications and shop floor systems 
these systems are being renovated or replaced as necessary to assure year compliance 
utilizing both internal and external resources to identify and assess needed year remediation  the company currently anticipates that its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts will be completed by june   prior to any currently anticipated impact on its computer equipment and software and shop floor systems 
the company estimates that as of december  it has completed approximately of the initiatives that it believes will be necessary to fully address potential year issues relating to its computer equipment and software and shop floor systems 
the remaining initiatives are in process and expected to be completed before or about june  the company believes that the cost of its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts will approximate to million  which expenditures will be funded from operating cash flows 
as of december   the company had incurred costs of approximately million related to the year issue 
principally all of these costs relate to analysis  repair  upgrade or replacement of existing software 
the company relies on numerous third party vendors and suppliers for a wide variety of goods and services  including raw materials  telecommunications and utilities such as water and electricity 
many of the company s operating locations would be adversely affected if these supplies and services were curtailed as a result of a supplier s year noncompliance 
the company s vendor and supplier base is currently being surveyed through questionnaires 
widespread disruption of certain utilities such as electricity would result in a temporary closure of affected facilities and potential damage to production equipment 
the company is engaging in a year business contingency planning process that will identify and evaluate potential worst case business disruption scenarios 
such plans may include securing alternate sources of supply  stockpiling raw materials  increasing inventory levels  adjusting facility shut down and start up schedules and other appropriate measures 
the contingency plans and related cost estimates will be refined as additional information becomes available 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of third parties including suppliers  customers  banks and governmental entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or results of operations 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology  unanticipated year noncompliance by suppliers and or customers  and similar uncertainties

important factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the company to differ from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements include  but are not necessarily limited to  the ability of the company to effect cost reduction initiatives and realize benefits from capital investments  the ability of the company to locate or acquire suitable acquisition candidates on acceptable terms  the company s ability to assimilate the operations of its acquired businesses into its existing operations  the company s ability to generate free cash flow to invest in its business and service its indebtedness  limitations and restrictions contained in the company s instruments and agreements governing its indebtedness  the ability of the company to retain sales with its major customers  the size and quality of the vegetable  tomato and fruit harvests in the midwest and west regions of the united states  changes in the pricing and availability to the company of raw materials or the company s ability generally to pass raw material price increases through to its customers  changes in consumer preferences for different packaging products  competitive pressures  including new product developments or changes in competitors pricing for products  changes in governmental regulations or enforcement practices  changes in general economic conditions  such as fluctuations in interest rates  changes in labor relations and costs  and other factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k or in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company also has limited foreign currency risk associated with its canadian operations 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the value of foreign currencies 
interest rate and foreign currency transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet the company s objectives 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing cost 
to achieve its objectives  the company regularly evaluates the amount of its variable rate debt as a percentage of its aggregate debt 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in its variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k outline the principal amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations 
based on the average outstanding amount of variable rate indebtedness of the company in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for the company s variable rate debt would have impacted the company s interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after giving effect to the company s interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company does not conduct a significant portion of its manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  the company s only foreign activities are conducted in canada 
the company s reported financial results could be affected  however  by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets where it operates 
when the us dollar strengthens against such foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profits generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against such foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profits generally increases 
since the company does not have significant foreign operations  the company does not believe it is necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
because the company s canadian subsidiary operates within its local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance such operation with local currency borrowings 
in determining the amount of such borrowings  the company evaluates the operation s short and long term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event that the canadian currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
furthermore  the company s canadian operating profit is used to repay its local borrowings or is reinvested in canada  and is not expected to be remitted to the company or invested elsewhere 
as a result  it is not necessary for the company to mitigate the economic effects of currency rate fluctuations on its canadian earnings
