year issue the company continues the process of working to resolve the potential impact of the yk on its products  internal computerized information systems  and external third party service and information providers 
the yk issue is the result of computer logic being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s or vendors computers that processes date sensitive information may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
all products currently being sold by veramark technologies are believed to be yk compliant based on internal tests 
several discontinued products or product versions are not compliant 
for most of those products the company offers an upgrade or replacement product at a discounted price 
the company feels that the net costs associated with non compliant discontinued products will not have a material impact on the company s financial results or cash flows in future periods

it must be noted however  that the company must rely on representations of yk readiness from its vendors and service providers  over which the company exerts no direct control 
if such representations should be in error  the effects of the wrongful representation could have material adverse effects on the results of veramark 
the company has not completed an assessment of a worst case scenario of major non compliance by a material supplier or customer 
however  the company does have a contingency plan to remedy the potential impact of such failures 
this plan includes an assessment of the magnitude and probability of potential risks and focuses on steps required to prevent yk failures from occurring  rapid detection of potential problems  and resolution 
the yk contingency plans will include measures such as selecting alternative suppliers or licensed software if necessary 
development of yk contingency plans are expected to be substantially complete by september
