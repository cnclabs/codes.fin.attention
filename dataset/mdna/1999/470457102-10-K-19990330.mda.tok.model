item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
development of new hotels 
jameson believes that attractive opportunities exist for the development of new jameson inns in certain markets in the southeastern united states 
accordingly  jameson intends to continue developing new jameson inns in targeted communities 
with operating jameson inns in alabama  georgia  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina and tennessee  jameson plans to continue developing jameson inns in those states as well as in florida  kentucky  louisiana and virginia 
at december   jameson had a total of jameson inns under development  including jameson inns under construction  and contracts to acquire parcels of land on which additional jameson inns are expected to be constructed during in addition  jameson currently has and will consider long term ground leases for future jameson inn locations 
as of december   four of the operating jameson inns are built on leased land  with terms up to years 
twenty new jameson inns were under construction at december   one had opened prior to february   and the remainder are expected to open in jameson believes that it has benefited significantly from its strategy of developing new jameson inns rather than acquiring existing properties and rehabilitating  refurbishing or re flagging them because of the experience and track record of jameson and jameson hospitality in the development  construction and operation of jameson inns 
if the merger is completed  jameson will consider developing new signature inns according to its assessment of market demand  cost and other relevant factors 
in any such cases  jameson expects that jameson hospitality will act as general contractor 
see jameson hospitality as contractor below in this section 
in evaluating potential development sites  jameson targets communities with strong industrial bases sufficient to attract business travelers 
these communities typically have significant manufacturing facilities  state and federal government installations  or colleges and universities 
jameson strives to locate its hotels in proximity to family style restaurants and targets markets which offer local community events eg annual festivals  fishing tournaments  collegiate football games and other athletic events  graduation ceremonies  etc 
and or tourist and recreational facilities eg lakes  golf courses  hunting areas  etc 
attracting groups and individual discretionary and leisure travelers 
expansion of existing hotel properties 
jameson intends to continue to expand existing jameson inns whenever market conditions warrant 
to date  jameson inns have undergone expansion and  at december   eight additional jameson inns were undergoing room expansions 
as of february   seven of these expansions were completed 
since jameson inns built prior to were initially constructed with the office and lobby  swimming pool and fitness center on sites generally large enough for future expansions  the incremental cost per room of expansions is lower than for new hotels 
accordingly  jameson has been able to earn attractive returns on its investment by expanding jameson inns in markets with strong room demand 
also  as compared to the development of new jameson inns  expansion of existing jameson inns is a relatively lower risk growth strategy since jameson has an opportunity to assess local room demand and market trends based on its direct experience in developing and owning the existing hotel 
if the merger is completed  jameson expects to employ substantially the same strategy regarding expansion of its currently operating jameson inns 
the sites for new  interior corridor jameson inns and all of the current signature inns are fully developed and these properties cannot be expanded 
in those markets  expansions will occur through the acquisition of additional sites and the construction of new hotels 
jameson hospitality as contractor 
we anticipate that jameson hospitality will act as general contractor for new jameson inns built by jameson and expansions of existing jameson inns and  if the merger is completed  signature inns 
each construction contract for a new jameson hotel or a group of hotels provides for a turnkey price for all work performed under the contract subject to reduction  however  if jameson hospitality s profits as defined in the construction contract exceed 
the contract price excludes the cost of the land and closing costs  but includes the costs of constructing and equipping the jameson hotels and related fitness centers  including interest charges incurred by jameson on the associated construction debt during construction and working with jameson hospitality to staff the hotel prior to opening 
each such construction contract is reviewed by an independent architectural firm and subject to approval by a majority of jameson s independent directors 
the average price charged by jameson hospitality for the new jameson inns opened during and the expansions opened in was approximately  per room 
internal growth 
through percentage rent  jameson participates in any increases in room revenues generated through increases in occupancy rates and average daily room rates adr of the jameson inns by jameson hospitality 
total rent payable under the jameson lease  including base rent and percentage rent  is limited  however  for each calendar year to of jameson hospitality s room revenues 
see the jameson lease  above 
jameson hospitality practices aggressive market sensitive pricing  increasing room rates at particular jameson inns as market conditions in the specific communities warrant 
the jameson inns site managers receive a significant portion of their compensation based on achieving specified monthly room revenues and annual expense controls 
jameson hospitality promotes an aggressive marketing program which focuses on local efforts directed to the business community in each jameson inn s market 
marketing the marketing of the jameson inns is the responsibility of jameson hospitality and focuses on local efforts directed to the business community in the city or town where the particular jameson inn is located 
in jameson hospitality hired six direct sales managers  each of whom conducts and supervises direct sales for designated jameson inns 
in addition  one of the key responsibilities of a jameson inn s manager is to make sales calls on local chambers of commerce  businesses  factories  government installations and colleges and universities 
the goal of the sales call is to familiarize local business people with the jameson inn in their community and solicit their recommendation of the jameson inn to business travelers visiting communities where jameson inns are located  including both individual discretionary travelers as well as groups attending family or community events 
jameson hospitality employs billboards and other similar types of advertising and has an number to facilitate reservations 
in addition to billboard advertising which jameson hospitality has traditionally utilized and will continue to utilize  jameson hospitality places advertisements for the jameson inns in regional and special event publications and in newspapers 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive 
each of the jameson inns is located in an area that includes competing hotels 
the number of competitive hotels in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy  adr and revenue per available room revpar of the jameson inns 
many of the jameson inns are located in smaller communities where the entry of even one additional competitor into the market may materially affect the financial performance of the jameson inn in that community 
jameson competes on the basis of price  quality and value 
jameson s competition is made up primarily of limited service hotels in the southeastern united states operating under national franchises which have greater financial resources than jameson  substantial advertising budgets  national reservation systems  marketing programs and greater name recognition 
regulations environmental matters 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
while jameson has not incurred any such costs in connection with its ownership of the jameson inns  jameson may be potentially liable for such costs 
jameson generally develops inns in areas where the historical use of the land is well known and often agricultural 
management is not aware of any potential material liability or claims for which jameson may be responsible 
however  no assurances can be given that i there are no material claims or liabilities related to real property ownership by jameson  ii future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on jameson  or iii the current environmental condition of the jameson inns will not be affected by the operation of the inns  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the jameson inns such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties 
under the terms of the jameson lease  jameson indemnifies jameson hospitality against environmental liabilities  except those caused by the acts or negligent failures of jameson hospitality 
in addition  the lease provides that jameson hospitality will indemnify the company against environmental liabilities caused by jameson hospitality s acts or negligent failures  although jameson hospitality s financial condition may limit the value of such indemnity and  in any event  such indemnity will not apply to or protect jameson against past unknown violations and related liabilities 
see the jameson lease 
jameson believes that the jameson inns are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and does not anticipate that it will be required in the foreseeable future to expend any material amounts in order to comply with such ordinances and regulations 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority  nor is it otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
americans with disabilities act 
under the americans with disabilities act of the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
in addition to remedial costs  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the company believes that all existing inns are substantially in compliance with these requirements and intends to construct future inns in accordance with such requirements as well 
in  the company engaged a disabilities consultant to make recommendations to the company regarding the inns compliance with the ada 
the consultant submitted a report recommending a number of improvements for access to and use by disabled persons with respect to certain of the inns then in operation  which improvements were made 
the company has also incorporated such consultant s recommendation into the construction of new inns

jameson considers relations with its employees to be excellent

policies and objectives with respect to certain activities the following is a discussion of jameson s investment objectives and policies  financing policies and policies with respect to certain other activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the sole discretion of the board of directors of jameson 
no assurance can be given that jameson s investment objectives will be attained or that the value of jameson will not decrease 
investment objectives and policies 
jameson s investment objective is to provide quarterly cash distributions and achieve long term capital appreciation through increases in cash flow and the value of jameson 
jameson will seek to accomplish these objectives through the ownership and leasing of the jameson inns and  if the merger is completed  signature inns  to jameson hospitality  selective development of additional jameson hotels in the united states  jameson hospitality s increases in the hotels room revenues and  where deemed appropriate  renovations and expansions of these properties 
a key criterion for new investments will be that they offer the opportunity for growth in funds from operations and cash available for distribution 
for definitions and calculation of funds from operations and cash available from operations  see item jameson management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
jameson anticipates that all of its activities will be conducted directly  although jameson inns located in certain states are owned by subsidiaries of jameson and jameson may participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures  partnerships or other types of co ownership 
jameson currently intends to invest only in jameson inns and signature inns if the merger is completed  although jameson may also hold temporary cash investments from time to time pending investment or distribution to stockholders 
jameson may purchase or lease properties for long term investment  expand and improve properties  or sell such properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over the equity interest of jameson 
while jameson emphasizes equity real estate investments  it may  in its discretion  invest in mortgages  stock of other reits and other real estate interests 
such mortgage investments may include participating or convertible mortgages 
however  jameson has not invested previously in mortgages and stock of other reits  and does not presently intend to do so 
dispositions 
jameson has no current intention to dispose of any of the jameson inns  except the jameson inn at milledgeville  georgia  although it reserves the right to do so if  based upon management s periodic review of jameson s portfolio  the board of directors of jameson determines that such action would be in the best interests of jameson 
financing 
in january  jameson filed a shelf registration statement on form s the registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec that provides for the issuance of an aggregate of up to million in jameson common stock  preferred stock and common stock warrants to be offered and sold from time to time 
on march   jameson completed the sale of  newly issued shares of jameson common stock 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay certain existing mortgage indebtedness at that date 
in february  jameson stockholders approved an amendment to the jameson articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of jameson common stock from million to million shares and the authorized shares of preferred stock from  to million shares 
later in jameson sold  under the registration statement   shares of jameson preferred stock at an offering price of per share 
jameson used the approximately million in net proceeds from the offering to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
jameson intends to use additional net proceeds  if any  from any sale of securities under the registration statement for the repayment of existing indebtedness  working capital and general corporate purposes 
in the event that the jameson board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  the jameson board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of jameson common stock or other capital stock of jameson in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
existing stockholders would have no preemptive right to purchase shares issued in any offering  and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder s investment in jameson 
it is anticipated that any additional borrowings will be made directly by jameson 
indebtedness incurred by jameson may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured and unsecured  and publicly and privately placed debt instruments 
such indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of the property of jameson or may be limited to the particular property to which the indebtedness relates 
the proceeds from any borrowings by jameson may be used for the payment of distributions  working capital  to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions  expansions or development of new hotels 
at december   jameson had outstanding an aggregate of approximately million of mortgage debt  including approximately million in construction debt 
the construction debt provides for total borrowings of million and is secured by mortgages on jameson inns 
jameson has adopted a policy of limiting its outstanding indebtedness to of aggregate appraised value of the jameson inns 
the management of jameson estimates that the outstanding indebtedness at december   represented approximately of the aggregate appraised value of the jameson inns 
jameson s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that jameson may incur 
accordingly  the jameson board of directors could change the current policies of jameson and jameson could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on the obligations of jameson and in an increase in debt service requirements 
such an increase could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of jameson  jameson s ability to make dividend distributions to its stockholders and could  as a result  jeopardize jameson s status as a reit 
working capital reserves 
jameson s policy is to maintain working capital reserves and when not sufficient  access to borrowings in amounts that the jameson board of directors determines to be adequate to meet normal contingencies in connection with the operation of jameson s business and investments 
policy regarding capital expenditures 
on july   jameson adopted a policy of maintaining cash or sufficient access to borrowings equal to of the jameson inns aggregate room revenues since july   less amounts actually spent from that date forward 
prior to this date  the obligation to fund replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment was jameson hospitality s 
for the period july   through december   of room revenues equaled million and jameson expended million on such items in that same period 
jameson is reviewing this matter and may consider changing its policy to increase this percentage 
other policies 
jameson intends to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the investment company act of jameson does not intend to a invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such issuer  b underwrite securities of other issuers or c actively trade in loans or other investments 
jameson may make investments other than as previously described  although it does not currently intend to do so 
jameson has authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire jameson common stock or any of its other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
during the past four years jameson has not issued jameson common stock or any other securities in exchange for property  nor has it reacquired any of its common stock or any other securities  however  jameson has authority to engage in such activities and may do so in the future 
prior to january   jameson made loans to jameson officers in connection with jameson s formation of partnerships to finance development of new jameson inns 
all such loans were repaid in full at the time such partnerships were liquidated 
jameson may in the future make additional loans to such persons and entities  including  without limitation  its officers  and to joint ventures in which it participates 
during the last four years  except in connection with formation of partnerships which  prior to their liquidation in early in conjunction with jameson s initial public offering  were formed by jameson to finance the development of jameson inns  jameson has not engaged in trading  underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers  and jameson does not intend to do so in the future 
jameson s policies with respect to such activities may be reviewed and modified from time to time by the board of directors of jameson without the vote of the stockholders 
at all times  jameson intends to make investments in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code to qualify as a reit unless  because of circumstances or changes in the internal revenue code or in the treasury regulations  the board of directors of jameson  with the consent of a majority of jameson s stockholders  determines to revoke jameson s reit election 
jameson may  under certain circumstances  purchase shares of jameson common stock in the open market or otherwise 
jameson has not repurchased any shares and the board of directors of jameson has no present intention of causing jameson to repurchase any of the shares of jameson common stock 
conflicts of interest 
because of thomas w 
kitchin s ownership in and positions with jameson  jameson hospitality and kitchin investments  inc  there are inherent conflicts of interest in the construction of new jameson inns and expansion of existing jameson inns by jameson hospitality and in jameson s dealings with jameson hospitality  under the jameson lease and with kitchin investments  inc under the cost reimbursement agreement 
see the jameson lease  growth plans for  jameson hospitality as contractor and employees 
in an effort to reduce the conflicts of interest  any material transaction or arrangement involving jameson and jameson hospitality  or an affiliate of either including kitchin investments  inc  is subject to approval by a majority of the independent directors of jameson 
further  jameson hospitality has agreed that neither it nor any of its affiliates will a operate or manage a hotel property in which jameson has not invested that is within a mile radius of a jameson inn  or b own or have any interest in any hotel property in which jameson or an affiliate does not have an interest 
in addition  mr 
kitchin is prohibited under the terms of his employment agreement with jameson from owning  managing or operating  directly or indirectly  any hotel property other than the jameson inns during the term of his employment by jameson or  for two years following such employment  any hotel property within a mile radius of a jameson inn 
in addition  the board of directors has a policy that any contract or transaction between jameson and one or more directors or officers of jameson  or between jameson and any other entity in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers  or have a financial interest  must be approved by a majority of either the independent directors of jameson or disinterested shareholders after the material facts as to the relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to them 
the board of directors may change this policy without the consent of the shareholders upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the independent directors of jameson 
federal income taxation of reits and reit stockholders jameson made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code  commencing with its taxable year beginning january  jameson made such election at the time of the filing of its federal income tax return for jameson believes that commencing with such taxable year  it was organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
jameson intends to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that it has qualified or will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 
the sections of the internal revenue code relating to qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion describes generally the most significant provisions of the internal revenue code sections relating to the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its stockholders 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by applicable internal revenue code provisions  treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
commencing with jameson s taxable year beginning january   jameson was organized and believes it has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit  its proposed method of operations will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under current internal revenue code provisions  and the merger of signature with and into jameson  if completed  will not cause jameson to cease to qualify as a reit 
jameson s qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon its ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels  stock ownership requirements and various qualification requirements imposed under the internal revenue code and discussed below 
no assurance can be given that the actual results of jameson s operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements 
for a discussion of the tax consequences of the failure to qualify as a reit  see failure to qualify below 
taxation of jameson 
a reit  such as jameson  generally is not subject to federal corporate income tax on its net income that is currently distributed to its stockholders because the reit provisions of the internal revenue code generally allow a reit to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation 
however  jameson will be subject to federal income or excise tax as follows 
first  jameson will be taxed at regular corporate rates on its reit taxable income  which is defined generally as taxable income subject to certain adjustments  including net capital gains  less dividends to stockholders 
second  jameson will generally be subject to the alternative minimum tax if reit taxable income plus any tax adjustments and preferences is greater than dividends paid to stockholders 
third  if jameson has a net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property generally  property acquired by reason of a default on a loan or an indebtedness held by a reit which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade of business or b other nonqualifying net income from foreclosure property  it will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if jameson has net income from prohibited transactions generally certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  such income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if jameson should fail to satisfy the or gross income tests discussed below and has nonetheless maintained its qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  it will be subject to a tax on the net income attributable to the greater of the amount by which jameson fails the or gross income tests  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect jameson s profitability 
sixth  generally  if jameson should fail to distribute to its stockholders during each calendar year an amount equal to its required distribution  it will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution amount over the amount actually distributed for the year 
the amount of required distribution is equal to the sum of a of its ordinary income for such year  b of its reit capital gain net income for such year and c the amount  if any  of the required distribution for the previous year over the amount actually distributed for that year 
in addition  if during the year period beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which jameson qualified as a reit the recognition period  jameson recognizes gain on the disposition of any asset held by jameson as of the beginning of such recognition period  then  to the extent of the excess of a the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period over b jameson s adjusted basis in such asset as of the beginning of the recognition period the built in gain  such built in gain  which may be reduced by certain net operating loss carryforwards of jameson  will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the recognition period began january   and will expire december  further  if jameson acquires any asset from a c corporation in a transaction in which jameson s basis in the asset is determined by reference to the c corporation s basis in the asset or any other property such as the proposed merger of signature into jameson  and jameson recognizes gain on the disposition of such asset during the year period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by jameson  then  to the extent of the built in gain  such gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the amount of jameson s built in gain based on the appraisals obtained in connection with the initial public offering of jameson s stock ipo is approximately million and will discourage a disposition by jameson of any inn held at the time of the ipo until after requirements for qualification 
the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association a which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  b the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  c which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the internal revenue code  d which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company  e the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  f at any time during the last half of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities  g which makes an election to be a reit and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the irs to elect and maintain reit status  h which uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and complies with the record keeping requirements of the internal revenue code and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  and i which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets 
the internal revenue code provides that conditions a to d  inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition e must be met during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
jameson has represented that it has met since the closing of the ipo  and currently does meet  all of such definitional requirements 
in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership  the treasury regulations provide that the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to such share 
in addition  the character of the assets and gross income of the partnership will retain the same character in the hands of the reit for purposes of section of the internal revenue code  including satisfying the gross income tests and the asset tests 
thus  jameson s proportionate share of the assets  liabilities and items of income of several limited liability companies in which jameson owns an interest such limited liability companies are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes will be treated as assets  liabilities and items of income of jameson for purposes of applying the requirements described herein 
income tests 
in order for jameson to maintain its qualification as a reit  it must satisfy two gross income tests annually 
first  at least of jameson s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property and certain mortgage interest or qualified temporary investment income generally  income attributable to the temporary investment of new capital received by jameson 
second  at least of jameson s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from the foregoing sources or from dividends  interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities 
rents received by jameson under the jameson lease will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
therefore  the percentage rent provisions of the lease should not disqualify rental income received from jameson hospitality 
second  the internal revenue code provides that rents received from a tenant  directly or indirectly  will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if the reit  or a direct or indirect owner of or more of the reit  directly or constructively owns or more of the voting power or total number of outstanding shares of a corporate tenant  or or more of the assets or net profits of a noncorporate tenant a related party tenant 
jameson has represented and covenanted that it has satisfied this requirement since its election to be taxed as a reit and will use its best efforts to continue to satisfy this requirement 
furthermore  jameson hospitality is not and should not become a related party tenant of jameson by reason of jameson s adherence to certain restrictions in its bylaws which void transactions in jameson s stock which would result in violations of this requirement 
third  if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
applicable internal revenue code provisions provide that with respect to each lease  rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent as the average of a reit s adjusted bases of all personal property at the beginning and at the end of each taxable year bears to the average of the reit s aggregate adjusted bases of all real and personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year 
jameson has represented that the resulting rental income attributable to personal property since january   has been  and will continue to be less than including rental income attributable to the personal property it will receive from signature  however  should the resulting rental income attributable to personal property exceed of all rental income  a portion of the personal property may be sold by jameson to jameson hospitality  with the lease payments adjusted accordingly 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  a reit generally must not operate or manage the leased property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit derives no revenue 
jameson has represented that it has not  does not and will not knowingly a charge rent for any property that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except by reason of being based on a percentage of receipts or sales  as described above  b rent any property to a related party tenant  c lease personal property in connection with the rental of the inns which would cause the rental income attributable to such personal property to exceed of the amount of total rental income  or d perform services considered to be rendered for the occupants of the inns other than through an independent contractor 
under the jameson lease  jameson hospitality has leased the land  buildings  improvements  furnishings  and equipment comprising the inns from jameson for a year term and pays jameson rent 
if the merger with signature is completed  jameson hospitality will lease the signature hotel properties which will then be owned by jameson under a master lease with terms and conditions other than the calculation of the amount of rent substantially the same as the jameson lease 
for purposes of the following discussion  that lease will also be referred to as the jameson lease and both jameson inns and signature inns will be referred to as inns 
in order for such rent to constitute rents from real property  the jameson lease must be viewed as a true lease for federal income tax purposes and not treated as a service contract  joint venture or some other type of arrangement 
the determination of whether the jameson lease is a true lease depends on an analysis of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances 
in addition  pursuant to internal revenue code section e  a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement may be treated instead as a lease of property if the contract  agreement or arrangement is properly treated as a lease of property  taking into account all relevant factors  including whether or not a the service recipient is in physical possession of the property  b the service recipient controls the property  c the service recipient has a significant economic or possessory interest in the property eg  the property s use is likely to be dedicated to the service recipient for a substantial portion of the useful life of the property  the service recipient shares the risk that the property will decline in value  the service recipient shares in any appreciation in the value of the property  the service recipient shares in savings in the property s operating costs  or the service recipient bears the risk of damage to or loss of the property  d the service provider does not bear any risk of substantially diminished receipts or substantially increased expenditures if there is nonperformance under the lease  e the service provider does not use the property concurrently to provide significant services to entities unrelated to the service recipient and f the contract price does not substantially exceed the rental value of the property for the term of the lease 
under the jameson lease  a jameson hospitality has the right to exclusive possession  use and quiet enjoyment of the inns during the term of the jameson lease  b jameson hospitality bears the cost of  and is responsible for daily maintenance and repair of the inns  other than the cost of maintaining underground utilities and structural elements including the roofs of the improvements  c jameson hospitality dictates how the inns are operated  maintained  and improved and bears all of the costs and expenses of operating the inns including the cost of any inventory used in their operation during the term of the jameson lease other than real and personal property taxes  casualty  liability and other types of insurance and equipment and the maintenance of structural elements  roofs and underground utilities  d jameson hospitality benefits from any savings in the costs of operating the inns during the term of the jameson lease  e in the event of damage or destruction to an inn  jameson hospitality is at economic risk because it will be obligated to restore the property to its prior condition and bear all costs of such restoration in excess of any insurance proceeds except  under certain circumstances  during the last six months of the term of the jameson lease  f jameson hospitality has indemnified jameson against all liabilities imposed on jameson during the term of the jameson lease by reason of injury to persons or damage to property occurring at the inns or due to jameson hospitality s use  management  maintenance or repair of the inns  and g jameson hospitality is obligated to pay substantial fixed rent for the term of the jameson lease 
in addition  jameson has represented that the total amount of rent provided under the jameson lease does not substantially exceed the fair rental value of the inns 
pursuant to irs revenue ruling  if one or more of the following conditions are present  the jameson lease will instead be considered as a conditional contract for purchase and sale of the inns a portions of the periodic payments are made specifically applicable to an equity interest in the property to be acquired by the lessee  b the lessee will acquire title upon the payment of a stated amount of rentals under the contract which it is required to make  c the total amount which the lessee is required to pay for a relatively short period of use constitutes an inordinately large proportion of the total sum required to be paid to secure the transfer of the title  d the agreed rental payments materially exceed the current fair rental value  e the property may be acquired under a purchase option at a price which is nominal in relation to the value of the property at the time when the option may be exercised  as determined at the time of entering into the original agreement  or which is a relatively small amount when compared with the total payments which are required to be made and f some portion of the periodic payments is specifically designated as interest or is otherwise readily recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
under the jameson lease  a no portion of the rent has been or will be applied to any equity interest in the inns to be acquired by jameson hospitality  b jameson hospitality has not acquired and will not be acquiring title to the inns upon the payment of a stated amount of rent  c the rent does not and will not materially exceed the current fair rental value of the inns according to jameson s representation  d the inns may not be acquired by jameson hospitality under a purchase option and e no portion of the rent under the jameson lease has been or will be specifically designated as interest or will be recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
based on the foregoing jameson believes that the jameson lease will be treated as a true lease for federal income tax purposes 
such conclusion is based  in part  on the following facts a jameson and jameson hospitality intend for their relationship to be that of a lessor and lessee and such relationship is documented by the jameson lease  b jameson hospitality will have the right to exclusive possession and use and quiet enjoyment of the inns during the term of the jameson lease  c jameson hospitality will bear the cost of  and be responsible for  day to day maintenance and repair of the inns  other than the cost of maintaining underground utilities and structural repairs  and will dictate how the inns are operated  maintained and improved  d jameson hospitality will bear all of the costs and expenses of operating the inns including the cost of any inventory used in their operation during the term of the jameson lease other than real property taxes  and the cost of replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment  to the extent such costs do not exceed the allowance of such costs provided under the jameson lease  e jameson hospitality will benefit from any savings in the costs of operating the inns during the term of the jameson lease  f jameson hospitality will indemnify jameson against all liabilities imposed on jameson during the term of the jameson lease by reason of a injury to persons or damage to property occurring at the inns  or b jameson hospitality s use  management  maintenance or repair of the inns  g jameson hospitality is obligated to pay substantial fixed rent for the period of use of the inns  and h jameson hospitality stands to incur substantial losses or reap substantial gains depending on how successfully it operates the inns 
there are no controlling treasury regulations  published rulings  or judicial decisions involving leases with terms substantially the same as the jameson lease that discuss whether such a lease constitutes a true lease for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  the foregoing conclusions with respect to the relationship between jameson and jameson hospitality are based upon all of the facts and circumstances and upon rulings and judicial decisions involving situations that are considered to be analogous 
there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert a contrary position 
if the jameson lease is recharacterized as a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement rather than a true lease  part or all of the payments that jameson receives from jameson hospitality may not satisfy the various requirements for qualification as rents from real property 
in that case  jameson likely would not be able to satisfy either the or gross income tests and  as a result  would fail to qualify as a reit 
if jameson fails to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  it may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
these relief provisions generally will be available if a jameson s failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  b jameson attaches a schedule of the sources of its gross income to its return  and c any incorrect information on such schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
it is not possible  however  to state whether in all circumstances jameson would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
as discussed above  even if these relief provisions apply  a tax would be imposed with respect to the excess net income 
asset tests 
for jameson to qualify as a reit  at the close of each quarter of its taxable year it must also satisfy three tests relating to the nature of its assets 
first  at least of the value of jameson s total assets must be represented by real estate assets which means a real property including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property  b shares in other reit s and c stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of jameson  and d cash  cash items including receivables and government securities 
second  not more than of jameson s total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the asset class 
third  of the investments included in the asset class  the value of any one issuer s securities owned by jameson may not exceed of the value of jameson s total assets and jameson may not own more than of such issuer s outstanding voting securities 
jameson s ownership of an interest in several limited liability companies are treated for purposes of the asset tests as ownership of a proportionate part of such limited liability companies assets 
jameson s investment in the inns through its interests in such limited liability companies constitutes qualified assets for purposes of the asset test 
as such  jameson expects that more than of the value of its assets will be real estate assets 
jameson has represented that it has satisfied these asset tests since december   and has covenanted that it will use its best efforts to continue to satisfy such tests in the future 
after meeting the assets tests at the close of any quarter  jameson will not lose its status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
jameson has represented that it maintains adequate records of the value of its assets to ensure compliance with the asset test and intends to take such action within days after the close of any quarter as may be required to cure any noncompliance 
however  there can be no assurance that such action will always be successful 
annual distribution requirements 
to qualify as a reit  jameson is required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to its stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of of its reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and any net capital gain and of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
in addition  if jameson disposes of any asset during the recognition period or  if the proposed merger with signature is completed  during the ten year period beginning on the effective date of the merger in the case of assets received from signature  jameson will be required to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before jameson timely files its tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
to the extent that jameson does not distribute all of its net capital gain or distributes at least  but less than of its reit taxable income  as adjusted  it will be subject to tax on the undistributed portion at regular corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if jameson should fail to distribute its required distribution during each calendar year  jameson would be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
since january   jameson has made  and hereafter intends to make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy all annual distribution requirements 
however  it is possible that  from time to time  jameson may experience timing differences between a the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and b the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at its reit taxable income 
in addition  in the event of the foreclosure of an inn by a mortgage lender  any debt discharge income would be subject to the annual distribution requirement even though jameson would receive no cash as a consequence of a foreclosure 
therefore  jameson could have less cash available for distribution than would be necessary to meet its annual distribution requirement or to avoid federal corporate income tax with respect to capital gain or the nondeductible excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income 
to meet the distribution requirement or to avoid federal income tax with respect to capital gain or the excise tax  it could be necessary for jameson to borrow funds 
under certain circumstances in which an adjustment is made by the irs that affects the amount that should have been distributed for a prior taxable year  jameson may be able to rectify the failure to meet the distribution requirement by paying deficiency dividends to stockholders in the later year  which may be included in jameson s deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year 
thus  jameson may be able to avoid being taxed on deficiency dividends 
however  jameson will be required to pay interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends 
recordkeeping requirements 
jameson must maintain certain records and request on an annual basis certain information from its stockholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of its outstanding shares 
if jameson failed to comply with these requirements for any of its taxable years ended on or before december   its reit status would be in jeopardy 
if jameson failed to comply with these requirements for its taxable year ending december   or fails to comply with these requirements for subsequent years  it will be required to pay on notice and demand by the secretary of the treasury and in the same manner as a tax a penalty of  if a failure to comply were attributable to intentional disregard of the aforementioned requirements  the amount of the penalty would be increased to  upon failure to comply with these requirements  the secretary of the treasury may require jameson to take such actions as it determines appropriate to ascertain actual ownership of its outstanding shares 
if jameson were to fail to take such actions  then jameson would be required to pay on notice and demand by the secretary of the treasury and in the same manner as a tax an additional penalty equal to the penalty previously paid 
none of these penalties would be imposed if it were shown that the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect 
jameson has represented that it has in the past and has covenanted that it will in the future comply with such requirements 
failure to qualify 
if jameson fails to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and the relief provisions do not apply  jameson will be subject to tax including any applicable corporate alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to stockholders in any year in which jameson fails to qualify will not be deductible by jameson nor will they be required to be made by jameson 
in such event  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income  and  subject to certain limitations  a corporate distributee may be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  jameson will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
whether jameson would be entitled to such statutory relief cannot be foreseen 
taxation of us stockholders 
as used herein  the term us stockholder means a holder of shares of jameson common stock or preferred stock that for united states federal income tax purposes a is a citizen or resident of the united states  b is a corporation  partnership  or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision thereof  c is an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source  or d is a trust if a united states court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust 
for any taxable year of which jameson qualifies for a taxation as a reit  amounts distributed to taxable us stockholders will be taxed as set forth below 
distributions generally 
distributions to us stockholders  other than capital gain dividends discussed below  will be taxable as ordinary income to such holders up to the amount of jameson s current or accumulated earnings and profits 
such distributions generally are not eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations 
to the extent that jameson makes distributions in excess of its current or accumulated earnings and profits  such distributions will first be treated as a tax free return of capital  reducing the tax basis of the us stockholders jameson common stock or preferred stocks as the case may be and second as gain realized from the sale of such stock 
dividends declared by jameson in october  november or december of any year payable to a us stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as paid by jameson and received by the us stockholder on december of such year  provided that the dividend is actually paid by jameson during january of the following calendar year 
us stockholders may not include in their own income tax returns any tax losses of jameson 
jameson will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution by jameson up to the greater of its current or accumulated earnings and profits 
as a result  us stockholders may be required to treat certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax free return of capital as taxable dividends 
moreover  any deficiency dividends will be treated as an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend  as the case may be  regardless of jameson s earnings and profits 
capital gain dividends 
dividends to us stockholders that are properly designated by jameson as capital gain dividends will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year to the extent they do not exceed jameson s actual net capital gain without regard to the period for which the us stockholder has held the jameson stock 
corporate us stockholders  however  may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
capital gain dividends are not eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations 
individual us stockholders and us stockholders that are estates and trust are subject to federal income tax on net capital gains at different tax rates depending upon the nature of the gain and the holding period of the asset disposed of 
in notice  the irs has provided guidance for reits to report information necessary for us stockholders to compute the appropriate tax in respect of capital gain dividends 
in general  capital gain dividends will be designated in a written notice to us stockholders as a rate gain distribution  an unrecaptured section gain distribution or a rate gain distribution 
although a reit is taxed on its undistributed net capital gains  a reit may elect to include all or a portion of such undistributed net capital gains in the income of its us stockholders 
in such event  the us stockholders will receive a credit or refund for the amount of tax paid by the reit on such undistributed net capital gains 
passive activity and loss  investment interest limitations 
distributions from jameson and gain from the disposition of shares of jameson stock ordinarily will not be treated as passive activity income for federal income tax purposes  and therefore  us stockholders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income 
dividends from jameson to the extent they do not constitute a return or capital generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitation 
net capital gain from the disposition of shares of jameson stock and capital gain dividends generally will be excluded from investment income unless the taxpayer elects to have the gain taxed at ordinary rates 
dispositions of jameson stock 
a us stockholder will recognize gain or loss on the sale or exchange of shares of jameson stock to the extent of the difference between the amount realized on such sale or exchange and the holder s tax basis in such shares 
such gain or loss generally will constitute long term capital gain or loss if the us stockholder has held such shares for more than one year and in case of an individual  will be taxed at a lower rate in such instance 
losses incurred on the sale or exchange of shares of jameson stock held for six months or less after applying certain holding period rules  however  generally will be deemed long term capital losses to the extent of any long term capital gain dividends received by the us stockholder with respect to such shares 
taxation of tax exempt stockholders 
distributions by jameson to a us stockholder that is a tax exempt entity should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section a of the internal revenue code ubti  provided that the tax exempt entity has not financed the acquisition of its shares with acquisition indebtedness within the meaning of section c of the internal revenue code and the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax exempt entity 
in addition  if jameson is considered to be a pension held reit  then a portion of the dividends paid to qualified trusts any trust defined under section a and exempt from tax under section a that owns more than percent by value in the reit may be considered ubti 
in general  a pension held reit is a reit that is held by at least one qualified trust holding more than by value of the interests in the reit or by one or more qualified trusts each of whom owns more than by value holding in the aggregate more than by value of the interests in the reit 
based on its annual effort to monitor ownership of its stock  jameson does not believe that it is a pension held reit 
taxation of non us stockholders 
the rules governing united states federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals  foreign corporations  foreign partnerships and other foreign stockholders collectively  non us stockholders are complex and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules 
non us stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal  state and local income tax laws with regard to their investment in jameson stock  including any reporting requirements 
distributions to non us stockholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by jameson of united states real property interests and not designated by jameson as capital gains dividends will be treated as ordinary income dividends to the extent their source is current or accumulated earnings and profits of jameson 
such distributions will ordinarily be subject to a withholding tax equal to of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax 
however  if income from a non us stockholder s investment in jameson stock is treated as effectively connected with the non us stockholder s conduct of a united states trade or business  the non us stockholder generally will be subject to a tax at graduated rates  in the same manner as us stockholders are taxed with respect to such distributions and may also be subject to the branch profits tax in the case of a stockholder that is a foreign corporation 
jameson expects to withhold united states income tax at the rate of on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a non us stockholder unless a a lower treaty rate applies and the required form evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with jameson or b the non us stockholder files an irs form with jameson claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of jameson will not be taxable to a non us stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the non us stockholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a non us stockholder s shares  such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non us stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of his shares in jameson  as described below 
if it cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution will be in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits  the distribution will be subject to withholding at a rate 
further  jameson will be required to withhold of any distribution in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits 
however  amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that such distribution was in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of jameson and the amount withheld exceeded the non us stockholder s non us tax liability 
for any year in which jameson qualifies as a reit  distributions that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by jameson of united states real property interests will be taxed to a non us stockholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of firpta 
under firpta  distributions attributable to gain from sales of united states real property interests are taxed to a non us stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
non us stockholders would thus be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us stockholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax 
distributions subject to firpta also may be subject to a branch profits tax in the case of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to treaty exemption 
jameson is required by treasury regulations to withhold of any distribution to a non us stockholder that could be designated by jameson as a capital gains dividend 
this amount is creditable against the non us stockholder s firpta tax liability 
unless the shares of jameson stock constitute a united states real property interest within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business  a sale of such shares by a us stockholder generally will not be subject to united state taxation 
the shares of jameson stock will not constitute a united states real property interest if jameson is a domestically controlled reit  which is defined generally as a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of the reit s stock was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
jameson believes that it is and will continue to be a domestically controlled reit and therefore that sales of the shares by non us stockholders should not be subject to us taxation 
notwithstanding the foregoing  capital gain not subject to firpta will be taxable to a non us stockholder if the non us stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply  in which case such person would be subject to a tax on such individual s capital gains 
information reporting requirements and backup withholding tax 
jameson will report to its us stockholders and the irs the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld  if any 
under certain circumstances  us stockholders may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of with respect to distributions paid 
backup withholding will apply only if the stockholder a fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number tin which  for an individual  would be such individual s social security number  b furnishes an incorrect tin  c is notified by the irs that it has failed to properly report payments of interest and dividends  or d under certain circumstances  fails to certify  under penalty of perjury  that it has furnished a correct tin and has not been notified by the irs that it is subject to backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend payments 
backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients  such as corporations and tax exempt organizations 
us stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption 
backup withholding is not an additional tax 
rather  the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a us stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such us stockholder s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such us stockholder to a refund  provided that the required information is furnished to the irs 
additional issues may arise pertaining to information reporting and backup withholding with respect to non us stockholders 
non us stockholders should consult their tax advisor with respect to any such information reporting and backup withholding requirements 
federal income tax proposals 
on february   the clinton administration announced its proposals for the fiscal year budget 
these proposals contain certain provisions that  if enacted  would significantly modify the reit related provisions of the internal revenue code 
a summary of the significant provisions is as follows permit taxable reit subsidiaries and prohibit preferred stock subsidiaries 
a reit would be permitted to have taxable subsidiaries through which the reit could conduct activities such as providing noncustomary services to reit tenants  providing third party management services  providing third party development services and engaging in dealer land sales 
many reits have set up preferred stock or non voting common stock subsidiaries to conduct such activities 
this proposal would prohibit preferred stock or non voting common stock subsidiaries 
the value of all taxable reit subsidiaries would be limited to of the reit s total assets  and the value of all qualified independent contractor subsidiaries would be limited to of the value to the reit s total assets 
prohibit closely held reits 
reits would be subject to an additional requirement for reit qualification which would prohibit certain closely held structures 
no entity or person would be permitted to own stock of a reit possessing or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock or or more of the total value of all shares of all classes of stock 
recognition of built in gain upon mergers of c corporations into reits 
this proposal would require immediate recognition of built in gain of any c corporation with a value of million or more which converts to reit status 
other tax consequences jameson and its stockholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions  including those in which it or they transact business or reside 
the state and local tax treatment of jameson and its stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 
consequently  jameson stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on ownership of jameson stock

item selected financial data the following table sets forth selected financial and operating information on a pro forma and historical basis for jameson 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

jameson notes that industry analysts and investors use funds from operations as another tool to evaluate and compare equity reits 
jameson also believes it is meaningful as an indicator of net income excluding most non cash items and provides information about jameson s cash available for distributions  debt service and capital expenditures 
other non cash expenses such as deferred finance cost amortization and stock based compensation expense have not been added back in funds from operations 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all of jameson s cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measure as an indicator of performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  jameson s funds from operations may not be comparable to other companies funds from operations due to differing methods of calculating funds from operations and varying interpretations of the nareit definition 
the jameson lease between jameson and jameson hospitality with regard to the jameson inns defines room revenues to include gross room rentals  revenues from telephone charges  vending machine payments and other miscellaneous revenues and excludes all credits  rebates and refunds  sales taxes and other excise taxes 
for purposes of computing these ratios  earnings have been calculated by adding fixed charges excluding capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends to income before extraordinary item 
fixed charges consist of interest costs whether expensed or capitalized  amortization of debt discounts and issue costs whether expensed or capitalized and preferred stock dividends in applicable periods 
jameson paid preferred stock dividends in and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of jameson and jameson hospitality and the accompanying notes which are included in this annual report on form k 
general jameson has grown from a hotel chain with four jameson inns  or rooms  at january   to jameson inns  or  rooms  in operation at december  from its inception in until december   jameson was engaged in the business of developing  owning and managing jameson inns 
as part of its development activities  jameson engaged in development and construction of new jameson inns 
on december   jameson reorganized by divesting itself of the subsidiary corporations through which it conducted its construction activities  securities brokerage activities and aviation operations 
in addition  jameson transferred its outdoor advertising business to jameson hospitality s predecessor  which is wholly owned by jameson s chairman and chief executive officer and his spouse 
jameson no longer manages or operates the jameson inns upon their completion  but limits its primary activities to developing and owning the properties 
effective january   jameson s primary source of revenue became lease payments by jameson hospitality which leases and operates the inns under the jameson lease 
the jameson pro forma financial information has eliminated those businesses in which jameson has not been engaged in since it divested itself of these businesses on december   so as to be comparable to the subsequent years historical financial information 
although room revenues are earned by jameson hospitality  not jameson  they are the basis upon which the percentage rent paid to jameson by jameson hospitality under the jameson lease is determined and  accordingly  such revenues are discussed below 
the term same inn room revenues refers to revenues earned with respect to jameson inns which were operating during all of both comparison periods and includes revenues attributable to rooms added to existing jameson inns by virtue of expansion of such jameson inns 
the jameson lease provides for the payment of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended december   combined base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million was earned by jameson 
the principal determinant of percentage rent under the jameson lease is room revenues of the jameson inns 
therefore  we believe that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the operating jameson inns  particularly with respect to occupancy  adr and revpar  is appropriate for understanding jameson s lease revenue see funds from operations  cash available for distribution  below  for the calculation of adr and revpar 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  jameson s lease revenue for increased to million as compared to million for the increase was due to an increase in jameson hospitality s room revenues

jameson inns occupancy rate decreased from for to for the decrease in overall occupancy of the jameson inns is attributable primarily to a the expansion of several high occupancy jameson inns which then experienced lower occupancy rates because of the additional rooms available  b the opening of new jameson inns which typically require several months of operations before realizing higher occupancy rates and c additional competition in certain markets 

adr increased from in to in jameson hospitality s same inn room revenues for versus grew to million from million  or 
the growth is due to an increase in adr from to for these jameson inns and an increase in room nights available due to expansions of certain of these jameson inns from  to  partially offset by a decrease in the occupancy rate from to for these jameson inns for compared to during  jameson s lease revenue was affected by the limitation equal to of room revenues for the year 
jameson s general and administrative expense includes overhead charges for management  accounting and legal services for the corporate home office 
jameson s general and administrative expense for was  as compared to  for  due to additional costs resulting from the increased size of jameson and more time spent by shared employees on jameson s business matters as compared to jameson hospitality s and other related entities

jameson s interest expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in its average outstanding debt balance in as a result of the early extinguishment of debt in and  jameson had losses of  and  respectively  comprised of the write offs of deferred finance costs and prepayment penalties  which are reflected as extraordinary items 
jameson s depreciation expense increased from million in to million in  due to an increase in the number of operating jameson inns and the expansion of existing jameson inns 
jameson s loss on disposal of furniture and equipment increased from  in to  in due to an increase in replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment before the end of its depreciable life 
in  jameson adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations or held for sale when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
during  jameson recognized a  loss on impairment of real estate related to one of the hotel properties  which is being actively marketed for sale 
no other impairment losses have been recognized 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  lease revenue for jameson for increased to million as compared to million for the increase was due to an increase in jameson hospitality s room revenues

funds from operations  cash available for distribution the following table illustrates jameson s calculation of funds from operations and cash available for distribution on a historical basis for the years ended december   and in march  nareit published a new interpretation of funds from operations which jameson retroactively adopted at that time 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net income available to common stockholders    add depreciation expense    loss on disposals extraordinary item loss on impairment of real estate  funds from operations  per march nareit interpretation    add loan fee amortization expense less additions to reserve for furniture  fixtures and equipment   required loan principal repayments cash available for distribution    this amount equals of the aggregate room revenues of the jameson inns for the period 
liquidity and capital resources jameson expects to continue to develop additional jameson inns  signature inns if the merger is completed and expand existing jameson inns  as suitable opportunities arise 
jameson will not undertake such investments  however  unless adequate sources of financing are available 
since its election to be taxed as a reit  jameson has financed and currently intends to continue financing the construction of new jameson inns and signature inns if the merger is completed entirely with bank borrowings 
jameson believes it can continue to finance new hotels and expansions  with these construction and long term mortgage loans 
at december   jameson had approximately million in outstanding debt and jameson had operating jameson inns which were debt free and could be used as collateral should jameson need additional borrowing capacity 
after the january financing described below there are two operating jameson inns which remain debt free 
jameson has a million line of credit the line convertible beginning in to term notes 
at december   jameson had drawn down million under the line with million remaining available credit 
loans made under the line bear interest at rates initially ranging from to  which are adjustable annually to equal a major lender s prime rate as published in the wall street journal plus 
or 
percentage points 
the minimum annual interest rate payable under the line is and the maximum is 
the annual interest rates at december   ranged from to 
loans made under the line are secured by mortgages on of the jameson inns 
payments of interest are due monthly  and monthly payments of principal and interest commence at various dates beginning in september principal under each term loan under the line is amortized using a year period and is payable in full at various dates through jameson uses the line to finance construction costs  if there is no construction loan in place  and certain other operating needs including the payment of dividends and other operating expenses 
in the past  jameson has employed construction and long term mortgage financing to fund the balance of construction costs not funded under the line 
for each new jameson inn to be built  jameson generally obtains a construction loan for approximately to million depending on the size of the jameson inn to be built 
after an month interest only period  each of the construction loans converts to a long term mortgage financing upon completion of the jameson inn without any further action by jameson  amortized over years and payable in full seven years from its inception 
the interest rate on each of such loans is adjusted annually  to rates ranging from the prime rate then prevailing to prime plus 
as of december   the construction loans are secured by mortgages on of the jameson inns under construction 
as of december   jameson had a total of jameson inns and eight expansions under construction with total construction costs  excluding land and closing costs  expected to total million when the projects are complete 
for ten of these properties  jameson had obtained construction loans in totaling million 
in  jameson obtained additional financing commitments for six more of the jameson inns under construction 
this includes million in loans for three jameson inns which loans are scheduled to close when the properties open and million for three other jameson inns under construction 
in  jameson also has obtained financing commitments aggregating for million for six expansions under construction at december  other construction costs will be borrowed under the line if property specific financing is not obtained 
on january   jameson entered into an agreement with a bank to provide million in new financing  which is secured by operating jameson inns which were previously debt free 
this bank note bears interest at the weekly average yield on united states treasury securities adjusted to the constant maturity of one year plus per annum and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of  until january when the note matures 
in addition  each month  must be deposited into a replacement reserve escrow until such time as the reserve account has a balance not less than  the proceeds of this financing will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the line 
since jameson presently intends to rely primarily on borrowings for construction and permanent financing of new jameson inns and the expansion of existing properties  the lack of sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could prevent or significantly deter jameson from constructing new hotels or expanding existing hotels 
the availability of such financing depends on a number of factors over which jameson has no control  including general economic conditions  the economic and competitive environments of the communities in which jameson s hotels are located and the level and stability of long term interest rates 
jameson also is considering possible additional long term debt or equity financing that would be available to fund its ongoing development activities 
in january  jameson filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec to provide additional financing 
see item business policies and objectives with respect to certain activities financing for a description of this registration statement 
as with most real estate investments  jameson s investments in the jameson inns are relatively illiquid and such illiquidity is further increased by the location of many jameson inns in small communities 
as a result  the ability of jameson to sell or otherwise dispose of any jameson inn to provide liquidity will be very limited 
jameson has four stock incentive plans in place 
as of december    shares of jameson common stock were reserved for future grants and options to purchase  shares of jameson common stock were outstanding including  which were exercisable 
in addition  as of december    shares of jameson common stock issued to certain key employees of jameson and jameson hospitality are restricted as to sale until fully vested in  and year as the year approaches  a critical business issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value 
many existing application software products in the marketplace were designed to accommodate only two digit date entries 
beginning in the year  these systems and products will need to be able to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from prior years 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
jameson has evaluated its financial software and building operating systems of the jameson inns 
based on assessments to date  management believes that the arrival of the year and the potential related computer problems will not have a material adverse impact on jameson 
jameson believes that its current software and operating systems are year compliant 
based on current information  costs of addressing and solving year problems are not expected to have a material effect on jameson s financial position or results of operations 
the ability of third parties with whom the company transacts business to address adequately their year issues is outside of jameson s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of jameson  or such third parties  to address adequately their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect on jameson s future financial condition or results of operations 
jameson maintains contingency plans in its normal course of business designed to be deployed in the event of various potential business interruptions 
these generally include manual workarounds and adjusting staffing 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
although jameson hospitality raised its room rates by approximately in  in and in  competitive pressures have limited  and may in the future limit  jameson hospitality s ability to raise rates in the face of inflation
