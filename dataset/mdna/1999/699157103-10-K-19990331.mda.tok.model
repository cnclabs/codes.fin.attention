item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since  our primary focus has been exploratory drilling using d seismic technology 
our long term business strategy is to increase our reserve base by using this and other advanced technologies 
additionally  we intend to exploit our existing properties and to acquire properties we believe can be exploited by developing reserves not previously produced 
we undertake projects only when we believe the project has the potential for initial cash flow adequate to return the project s capital expenditures within a short period of time  generally less than months 
we also endeavor to maximize the present value of our projects by accelerating production of our reserves consistent with prudent reservoir management and prevailing energy prices 
following this strategy  we have discovered gas and oil reserves using d seismic technology in the horseshoe atoll reef trend of west texas and the yegua frio wilcox gas trend onshore the gulf coast of texas and acquired producing gas and oil properties in the permian basin of west texas 
capital used to acquire these properties has been provided primarily by secured bank financing  sales of our equity securities and cash flows from operations 
our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our gas and oil and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices we receive are influenced by 
seasonal demand  
weather  
hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  
availability of pipeline transportation to end users  
proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and 
to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include 
production expenses  
overhead requirements  and 
costs of capital 
our gas and oil producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of gas and oil properties and with the exploration and development of gas and oil reserves 
normal dispositions of gas and oil properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
certain directly identifiable internal costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
in  internal costs capitalized totaled  compared with  in and  in depletion of capitalized costs is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved gas and oil reserves 
gas and oil production is converted to a common unit of measurement based upon relative energy content of each commodity 
costs from unproved properties are excluded from depletion until evaluated 
under the full cost method of accounting  net capitalized costs of gas and oil properties  or the full cost ceiling limitation  are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
depletion per equivalent unit of production ebo was in versus in and in the increase per boe was a result of a combination of factors including 
a decline in parallel s reserve base during due to lower commodity prices  
an increase in parallel s net depletable basis  as a result of an impairment charge to the full cost pool related to unproved properties  and 
the effect of unsuccessful drilling efforts  which increase the cost pool but add no units of production 
results of operations our business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in our 
reserve base  
sources of production  
product mix gas versus oil volumes  and 
the prices we receive for our gas and oil production

parallel s total oil and gas revenues for were  a decrease of  or approximately  from  for the decrease in revenues for  compared to  is related to a decline in the average prices we received for our natural gas and oil production volumes  and  to a lesser degree  a decline in production volumes 
production 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled  ebo compared with  ebo in  a decline  resulting from a decrease in natural gas production 
the decrease in natural gas production was primarily due to normal production declines associated with producing wells and decreased drilling activity in  which limited our ability to replace gas and oil we produced during the year 
production costs 
the decrease in production costs for  compared with  was primarily the result of adding lower cost oil and gas production  a decrease in the accrual of ad valorem taxes and  to a lesser degree  a decrease in production volumes 
production costs decreased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   from  for the same period of production costs as a percentage of revenues increased primarily because of lower gas and oil prices 
average production costs per ebo decreased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to salary and benefit adjustments and increased franchise taxes 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period in this increase is primarily a result of the low gas and oil prices we received in  which reduced revenues 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
dd a expenses for increased  or to  from  for this increase was a result of a combination of factors that included 
production of  ebo  
reserve additions of  ebo  
a decrease in our proved reserves from  ebo in to  ebo in due to low commodity prices and reservoir performance  
a downward revision of  ebo  due to property performance and low gas and oil prices  and 
an increase in our full cost pool related to the impairment of unproved properties 
dd a expense as a percentage of revenues increased primarily because of the impairment charge  which increased the dd a rate to per ebo from in  and lower gas and oil prices  which reduced revenues 
impairment of gas and oil properties 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a noncash impairment charge of  or  net of tax  related to our gas and oil reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of gas and oil assets was primarily the result of the effect of significantly lower natural gas and oil prices on both proved and unproved gas and oil properties 
we did not recognize an impairment in under full cost accounting rules  each quarter we are required to perform a ceiling test calculation 
the full cost pool carrying values cannot exceed a company s future net revenues from its proved reserves  discounted at per annum using constant current product prices  and the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
at december   natural gas and oil prices were much lower compared with year end prices  resulting in an impairment charge to the full cost carrying value of our gas and oil properties 
in response to the decline in oil prices and the softening of natural gas prices  in the third quarter of  we postponed the development of certain unproved properties and instead focused on projects that were lower risk with the potential to add significant reserves 
we determined that it was likely  because oil prices were at the lowest levels in decades and natural gas prices had also declined  that the postponement of developing certain unproved properties had caused a decline in the carrying values of such properties 
therefore  we included the lower of cost or market of certain unproved properties in our full cost pool for the ceiling test 
the ceiling test was computed using the net present value of reserves at december  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
the prices used to compute the ceiling test in were per bbl and per mcf 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of this increase was principally a result of an increase in average borrowings from our revolving line of credit facility 
borrowings were used to conduct d seismic acquisition and drilling activities in the yegua frio wilcox gas trend 
additionally  cash flows generated from operations declined as a result of lower gas and oil prices  which necessitated additional borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
income tax benefit expense 
for the year ended december   we recognized a tax benefit of  which includes a  deferred tax valuation charge to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our deferred tax assets and  in light of the current economic conditions in the gas and oil industry  the outlook for future commodity prices  and our operational results in  we believe that some of our net operating losses may expire unused 
therefore  we established a valuation allowance against them 
we recognized tax expense in of  our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in you should read note of the notes to the financial statements on page f  included in
