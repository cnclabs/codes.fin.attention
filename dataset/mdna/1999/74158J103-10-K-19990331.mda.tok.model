item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the predecessor s combined financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a fully integrated real estate investment company organized under maryland law  providing property management  leasing  marketing  acquisition  development  redevelopment  construction  finance and other related services 
as of december   we owned office properties eight were acquired during and the remaining were owned at december   industrial properties all were owned at december   one retail center  and one parking facility 
our properties are located primarily in the chicago metropolitan area 
in addition  we own a mortgage on an office property located at n 
lasalle street  chicago  illinois 
as of december   in terms of net rentable square feet  approximately of our office properties and of our industrial properties were located in the chicago metropolitan area in prime business locations within established business communities 
the properties located in the chicago metropolitan area account for approximately of our rental revenue and of our tenant reimbursements revenue for the year ended december  our remaining office properties are located in the nashville  tennessee  knoxville  tennessee  and milwaukee  wisconsin metropolitan areas 
our remaining industrial properties are located in the columbus  ohio metropolitan area 
our income is derived primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from our properties supplemented by interest income on the mortgage note owned 
we expect that revenue growth over the next several years will come from a combination of additional acquisitions and revenue generated through increased rental and occupancy rates in the current portfolio

results of operations the following analysis provides a comparison of our operations for the years ended december  and the period from january  through november  represents the activity of the predecessor s properties and the period from november  through december  represents our activity 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in analyzing the operating results for the year ended december   the changes in rental and reimbursable revenue  property operating expenses  real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization from are due principally to the addition of operating results from properties contributed and acquired as part of our initial public offering as well as properties acquired after our initial public offering through december  the predecessor s properties currently owned by us consisted of five office properties  industrial properties  and a parking facility 
at the time of our initial public offering  nine additional office properties  additional industrial properties and one retail center were contributed or acquired 
after the date of our initial public offering and through december   we acquired ten additional office properties and a first mortgage note encumbering an office property as described in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k

the additional office and industrial properties resulted in increased total rental revenue and tenant reimbursements income of million  other revenue of million  property operating expenses and real estate tax expense of million and depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  included in the rental revenue increase for is million related to lease terminations 
rental revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue for the predecessor s properties increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in depreciation and amortization expense for the predecessor s properties increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in mortgage note interest income increased by million to million due to the acquisition of the first mortgage note encumbering the property known as north lasalle street in december interest expense had a net increase of million  or  to million during the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase due to mortgages obtained on certain of the properties which were contributed or acquired after our initial public offering  as well as our credit facilities borrowings used to fund property acquisitions  offset by a million decrease as a result of the repayment of debt with proceeds from our initial public offering or debt forgiveness in general and administrative expense increased million during the year ended december   reflecting costs related to our new public status and increased size 
the million decrease in financing fees and the million decrease in property and asset management fees are due to these fees being incurred by the predecessor under their previous ownership and are costs we no longer incur 
in  the predecessor recorded a provision for environmental remediation costs of million  which represents the estimated costs to be incurred for the clean up of environmental contamination of certain industrial properties 
pgi has contractually agreed to indemnify us from any environmental liabilities we may incur 
no additional provision was deemed necessary in income allocated to minority interests increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to an increase in income before minority interest of million  or  to million due to the changes in revenue and expenses described above and a change in the ownership structure 
the increase in income before minority interests is due to additional properties either being contributed or acquired and the effects they had on revenue and expenses described above 
the change in ownership structure is due to certain ownership percentages changing do to our initial public offering 
extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt decreased million to a million extraordinary loss in  due to the gain in related to the forgiveness of debt principal net of the write off of various deferred costs  while the loss in represents only the write off deferred costs for mortgage indebtness that was repaid or refinanced and a reduction in the maximum balance that can be drawn on one of our credit facilities

our credit facilities  with a maximum loan availability totaling million  have been provided by various financial institutions  and are collateralized by first mortgages on certain properties owned by the operating partnership 
subject to our compliance with the applicable loan covenants  the credit facilities may be used to provide funds for acquisitions and development activities and to provide the replacement letters of credit for the million of tax exempt bonds 
no amounts were drawn on credit facilities at december  except for the letters of credit impact on current availability 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
in january and february  we drew million from our credit facilities to acquire two office buildings 
mortgage notes 
we have financed a portion of our acquisitions with proceeds from mortgage notes payable from various financial institutions  with fixed and variable interest rates and maturities of through we feel that our properties have excess value that may be utilized for additional mortgage borrowing or debt securitizations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
future offerings 
on january   we filed our initial shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to register up to million of our equity and debt securities for future sale 
we intend to fund future acquisitions and development with a combination of advances from our credit facilities  additional mortgage notes payable and future equity and debt offerings 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations 
our properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
during  our tenant improvements and leasing commissions averaged per square foot of newly leased office space  per square foot of renewal leased office space  and per square foot of newly leased industrial space 
our estimated annual cost of recurring tenant improvements and leasing commissions is approximately million based upon average annual square feet for leases expiring during the years ending december  and our cost of general capital improvements to our properties average approximately million annually based upon an estimate of per square foot 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property development  property acquisitions and other non recurring capital improvements through a combination of net cash from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness including the credit facilities and the issuance of additional equity securities 
the terms of the credit facilities and our preferred shares impose restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness and issue additional preferred shares 
historical cash flows historically  we have generated positive cash flows from operations to fund distributions to our shareholders and have funded our expansion primarily through equity offerings and mortgage debt financing 
historically  the predecessor s principal sources of funding for operations and capital expenditures were from mortgage debt financing

the million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  from the year ended december  was primarily due to a million decrease in proceeds from the sale of real estate  a million increase in real estate expenditures  a million purchase of a mortgage note receivable  a million increase in deferred costs  a million increase in amounts due from affiliates and a million cash contribution to the services company 
we had consolidated net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  we and the predecessor had consolidated and combined net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  and the predecessor had combined net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  from the year ended december  was primarily due to a million net decrease in the net proceeds from the sale of our preferred and common shares and operating partnership units  a million increase in cash used to repurchase our common shares  a million increase in the repayment of mortgage notes payable and net repayment of credit facilities  a million increase in distributions to our preferred and common shareholders and the operating partnership s minority interest unit holders  a million increase in financings costs  a million decrease in proceeds from mortgage note payable affiliates  and a million decrease in contributions from predecessor partners offset by a million increase in proceeds from mortgage notes payable and net proceeds from credit facilities  a million decrease in the repayment of mortgage notes payable from affiliates  a million decrease in due from affiliates  a million contribution from minority interest other and a million decrease in debt termination fees

funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations  as defined by nareit  an alternative measure of performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit to mean net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization other than amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results and the predecessor s combined historical operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in audited combined financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper with the exception that we report rental revenues on a cash basis based on contractual lease terms  rather than a straight line gaap basis  which we believe results in a more accurate presentation of our actual operating activities  which may differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
as a result of our reporting rental revenues on a cash basis for funds from operations  contractual rent increases will cause reported funds from operations to increase 
further  funds from operations does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt repayment obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or the ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following is our consolidated quarterly summary of funds from operations 
period from november  year ended december  through fourth third second first december  total quarter quarter quarter quarter net income allocated to common      shareholders ffo adjustments real estate depreciation and amortization       amortization of costs for leases assumed  straight line rental revenue adjustments  minority interests      extraordinary loss  funds from operations       other data net cash provided by used in operating activities      net cash used in investing activities 
      net cash provided by financing activities       excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and non real estate related depreciation 
year the year yk issue refers generally to computer applications using only the last two digits to refer to a year rather than all four digits 
as a result  these applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather than the year we have taken yk initiatives in the following three general areas information technology we have focused our efforts on the high risk areas of the corporate office computer hardware  operating systems and software applications 
the principal risks relating to our information technology are failure to correctly bill tenants and pay invoices 
our assessment and testing of existing equipment revealed that our hardware  network operating systems  secondary information systems and desktop software applications are yk compliant 
however  we currently have four accounting and property management systems that are not yk compliant 
we initiated a comprehensive corporation wide plan in mid to completely replace our financial and operational systems by the fourth quarter of in order to facilitate our future growth and to improve operational controls 
we anticipate the total cost of this effort will be million to million and will have the additional benefit of making our financial and operational systems yk compliant 
of the total project costs  we estimate approximately million to million is attributable to the purchase and implementation of new software and equipment which will be capitalized and the remainder related to the assessment  modifications to existing hardware and software  and training which will be expensed as incurred 
we also believe that some of our telecommunication systems may not be yk compliant 
we are currently assessing these systems and  where material  plan to replace  modify or upgrade these systems  as appropriate  by the end of the second quarter of non information technology non information technology consists mainly of facilities management systems such as telephone  utility  and security systems for the corporate office and owned properties 
based on our current efforts  the corporate office s non information technology is expected to be yk compliant by mid we are in the process of identifying date sensitive systems and equipment at our properties 
to date  we have not identified any critical non compliant systems 
assessment and testing of non information technology at our properties is expected to be competed by mid third parties we have third party relationships with tenants  suppliers and contractors 
many of these third parties are publicly traded corporations and subject to disclosure requirements 
we have begun assessment of major third parties yk readiness including tenants  key suppliers of outsourced services including stock transfer  debt servicing  banking collection and disbursement  payroll and benefits  while simultaneously responding to their inquiries regarding our readiness 
the principal risks to us in our relationships with third parties are the failure of third party systems used to conduct business such as i tenants being unable to efficiently conduct their business  ii banks being unable to process receipts and disbursements  iii vendors being unable to supply needed materials and services to the properties  and iv processing of outsourced payroll 
based on yk compliance work done to date  we have no reason to believe that key tenants  banks and suppliers will not be yk compliant in all material respects or cannot be replaced within an acceptable time frame 
additionally  we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining compliance certification from suppliers of key services 
we do not believe that the impact of the yk problem will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
such belief is based on our analysis of our risks related to both our own potential yk problems discussed above and our assessment of the yk problems of our vendors  suppliers and customers 
however  the description of our yk compliance is based upon information obtained by management through evaluations of internal business systems from inquiries of key tenants and major vendors concerning their compliance efforts 
if key tenants or major vendors with whom we do business fail to adequately address their yk issues  our financial position or results from operations could be materially adversely affected 
we currently do not have a contingency plan in place 
once we have proceeded further in the completion of steps outlined above  contingency plans will be developed 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance 
we expect to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation substantially all of our office and industrial leases require tenants to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office and industrial leases provide for fixed increases in base rent or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset  in part  by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
as of december   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities was subject to interest at floating rates and future indebtedness may also be subject to floating rate interest 
inflation  and its impact on floating interest rates  could affect the amount of interest payments due on such indebtedness 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

based upon the rates in effect at december  the weighted average interest rate on our mortgage notes payable and bonds payable at december  were and  respectively 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt increased by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would increase by million 
at december   we made deposits totaling million related to treasury lock agreements of million and million  which were to expire in the average lock rate reflected is based upon the agreements in effect as of december  for the million agreement and for the million agreement 
during the period from january  through march   we have received net cash settlements of approximately million million related to the million agreement  million related to the million agreement 
on march   we terminated the million treasury lock agreement due to the change in the terms and timing of the ibm plaza purchase as a result of the amended purchase agreement we had approximately million on deposit related to this agreement that was forfeited the time of the termination
