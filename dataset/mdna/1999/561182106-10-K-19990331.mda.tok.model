the company undertook a substantial recapitalization in and began a substantial capital investment program  both in connection with the roll out of its speedzone concept and in connection with the general upgrading of its strategic fecs

of the company s million of total debt at december  including accrued interest  million matures in the current debt 
the current debt primarily includes million of secured debt from a third party lender and a million loan from that lender through the company s largest shareholder 
the million of current debt and an additional million of indebtedness together  the pass through debt was advanced by the company s largest shareholder and reloaned to the company as an accommodation to the company and the third party lender so that the largest shareholder s equity interests in the company effectively supported that portion of the third party financing 
in the first quarter of  the company agreed in principle with its principal lenders on the recapitalization plan 
the principal components of the recapitalization plan which is subject to final documentation and funding of the million payment described below are as follows the company agreed to repay by may  subject to extension to may  under certain circumstances million of secured debt held by its principal non shareholder lender  the remaining million of debt including accrued interest held by that lender as of december  including million of advances made as an accommodation by the company s principal shareholder and reloaned to the company would be converted into perpetual preferred stock with a dividend rate and dividends payable in kind through january  in addition  the lender would receive six million company common shares

the agreement in principle is subject to the repayment of the million of secured debt  the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and other conditions 
the company has been in discussions with various capital sources to secure the amounts necessary to make the million payment 
there can  however  be no assurance that the company will be able to implement the recapitalization plan or as to the ultimate timing or terms thereof 
if the company is unable to refinance or restructure its indebtedness in the proposed recapitalization plan or otherwise  it would be forced to seek to obtain additional capital resources from other sources or take other actions because the company s present capital resources are not sufficient to fund its projected working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  including the repayment of the current debt  million of which is due in july there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such additional capital resources 
the company s strategy currently contemplates evaluating and developing plans for converting underperforming fecs to speedzones in the latter part of or in addition  the company intends to spend million to repair and renovate fecs and to purchase new games to revitalize current park operations during any such actions would  however  require the company to obtain additional capital resources even if the recapitalization plan described above is completed

impact of year issues the company will be required to modify or replace portions of its computer software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company believes that with modifications or replacements of existing software and certain hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact in the operations of the company 
the company relies on a significant number of computer programs and computer technologies collectively  it and non it systems for its key operations  including product design  point of sales systems  race car timing and safety systems  finance and various administrative functions 
the company engaged a year consultant to evaluate the current systems and prepare a plan for addressing compliance which was completed by year end 
the consultant requested confirmation from all vendors of their products status relative to year compliance 
the consultant reviewed the company s systems and provided a report to the company identifying information  compliance requirements and criticality of each system 
based on the report  the total cost of the year project is estimated at approximately  in the event that the company does not complete any phases of its year plan  the company would have to manually track sales until the problem is resolved 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the ability of third parties with which the company transacts business to adequately address their year issues is outside the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of the company or such third parties to adequately address their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company
