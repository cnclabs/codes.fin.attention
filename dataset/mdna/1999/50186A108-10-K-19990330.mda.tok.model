item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year compared to revenues increased to million in from million in  a increase 
acquisitions made during by spinnaker industries  inc were the most significant contributors to this increase 
in the multimedia segment  revenues increased by million  or from the previous year  partially due to the acquisition of upper peninsula telephone company in which control was acquired on march   the remainder primarily coming from growth in regulated and deregulated revenues 
in addition  results include management service income of million related to compensation for bidding and administrative services provided in certain pcs auctions 
at the morgan group  inc  revenues increased by million  or due to gains in specialized transport 
in the manufacturing segment  revenues increased by million  or 
on march   spinnaker acquired the adhesive backed label stock division of sd warren 
this operation contributed million to spinnaker s revenue increase 
on july   spinnaker acquired tesa tape  inc 
pressure sensitive electrical tape line and manufacturing plant 
this purchase contributed million to spinnaker s revenue increase 
the remaining spinnaker operations  central products and spinnaker coating  inc ohio reported small revenue decreases during as a result of higher unit volume  but at overall lower prices 
lynch systems revenues decreased by million from to due to lack of order activity for crt glass press machines 
during and early  lynch systems added several new consumer glass press machines to its product offerings and expects to be less dependent on orders for crt glass press machines in the future 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda increased to million in from million in  a million  or an increase 
ebitda for the telecommunications segment  which for represented of ebitda  increased by million  or  from to million of this increase was due to the acquisition of upper peninsula telephone company 
the remaining increase was due to growth in regulated and deregulated operations 
ebitda at the morgan group  inc which represents of ebitda increased by million  or from s ebitda primarily due to the absence of special charges in  special charges were million in ebitda for the manufacturing group  which represents of ebitda in  decreased by million due to decreases in ebitda at spinnaker coating  inc ohio  central products company and lynch systems  inc  which were not entirely offset by the additional ebitda as a result of the acquisition of the adhesive backed division of sd warren  which contributed million in ebitda in of note  the acquisition of the electrical tape division of tesa tape  inc 
was essentially flat from an ebitda perspective in lower prices plus higher manufacturing cost associated with increased volume caused the reduced ebitda at spinnaker coating and central products 
lynch systems negative ebitda variance of million was due to significant decreases in orders 
operating profits for were million  down from million in the telecommunications segment s operating profits grew million due to the inclusion of upper peninsula telephone company for the full year and revenue growth 
operating profits in the services segment increased by million  or  due to the absence of special charges 
operating profits in the manufacturing sector fell by million due to the million ebitda decline  depreciation and amortization associated with the sd warren and tesa tape acquisitions of million and million  respectively  and increased depreciation from capital expenditures at central products made in previous years 
effective september   the company amended its sar stock appreciation rights program so that the sars become exercisable only in the event the price for the company s shares double from the sar grant price within five years from the original issuance 
the grant prices of the  sars currently outstanding range from to 
on december   the closing price of the company s common shares in trading on the american stock exchange was 
this amendment eliminated the recording of the profit and loss effect from changes in the market price in the company s common stock until it is probable that the sars will become exercisable 
during  the company recorded million sar expense and in  prior to the amendment of the program  million in sar income 
investment income was approximately million both in and interest expense increased by million in when compared to the increase is due primarily to the effect of financing the two spinnaker acquisitions 
on july   spinnaker industries  inc completed the acquisition of the electrical tape division of tesa tape  inc 
a portion of the purchase price was satisfied by the issuance of  shares  subject to certain adjustments  of spinnaker s class a common stock 
as a result of this issuance  the company recorded a gain on sale of subsidiary stock of million  or million per share after tax 
as of december   wnm communications  inc a lynch telephone corporation subsidiary  sold the assets of its direct broadcast satellite business serving portions of new mexico for approximately million 
as a result of the transaction  a pre tax gain on the sale of the assets of approximately million was recognized and classified as gain on sale of subsidiary stock and other operating assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  lynch recorded a write off of of the investment in  loans to  and deferred costs associated with its subsidiary s equity ownership in fortunet communications  lp fortunet  a partnership formed to acquire  construct and operate licenses for the provision of personal communications services in the so called c block 
such write off amounted to million  or million after tax benefit see discussion below 
no such write off occurred in lynch will continue to evaluate the realizability of its investment in fortunet and anticipates that the final results of the fcc reauction of pcs licenses which began on march   could have a significant impact on this evaluation 
the tax provision of million  includes federal  state and local taxes and represents an effective rate of versus effective tax benefit rate in the difference in the effective rates is primarily due to the effects of the amortization of goodwill and losses of subsidiaries 
during  minority interest was income of million versus million expense in the variance was primarily associated with additional losses recorded by spinnaker owned subsidiary by the company at december  during year compared to revenues increased to million in from million in  a increase 
acquisitions made during late and early in the multimedia and service segments were the most significant contributors to this increase 
in the multimedia segment  revenues increased by million to million from million in the previous year 
dunkirk and fredonia telephone company  which was acquired on november   contributed million compared to million in upper peninsula telephone company  control of which was acquired on march   contributed million to this segment s revenue increase 
in the services segment  revenues of million resulting from the acquisition of transit homes of america  inc on december   offset by lower truckaway revenues  was the primary contributor to the revenue increase at the morgan group  inc in the manufacturing segment  revenues decreased by million reflecting order short fall at lynch systems  inc formerly lynch machinery  inc of million  revenue short fall at all three units of spinnaker of million  and partially offset by improved revenues at m tron of million 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda increased to million in from million in  an million  or a increase 
operating segment ebitda prior to corporate management fees and expenses grew to million from million  a increase 
the manufacturing segment represented of ebitda  or million  a decrease of million versus while all of the other components of the manufacturing segment had increases  they were more than offset by lower ebitda at lynch systems of million when compared to results due to lower sales volume of the extra large glass presses 
the services segment had ebitda of million versus negative ebitda of million in predominately due to special charges recorded at morgan of million in and million in the multimedia segment contributed million  or of total ebitda versus million in due the effects of the acquisition of dunkirk fredonia telephone company and upper peninsula telephone company 
operating profits for were million  an increase of million  or  versus operating profits in the services segment increased by million due to the same factors impacting ebitda 
there were also increases in the multimedia and corporate segments operating profits of million and million offset by a decline in the manufacturing segment of million 
investment income decreased by million to million in versus the decrease was related to lower dollar investments generating current income 
interest expense increased by million in when compared to the increase is due primarily to the full year effect of financing the acquisitions of dunkirk and fredonia telephone company  the acquisition of upper peninsula telephone company and the subordinated notes issued by spinnaker in october in  lynch provided a reserve of of the investment in  loans to  and deferred costs associated with its subsidiary s equity ownership in fortunet communications  lp fortunet  a partnership formed to acquire  construct and operate licenses for the provision of personal communications services pcs in the so called c block auction 
such write off amounted to million  or million after tax benefit 
in may  the fcc concluded the c block auction for megahertz of broadband spectrum across the united states to be used for pcs 
pcs is the second generation of low cost digital wireless service utilized for voice  video and data devices 
in the c block auction  certain qualified small businesses were afforded bidding credits as well as access to long term government financing for a substantial portion of the cost of the licenses acquired 
as a result of this auction  fortunet acquired licenses in states covering a population pop of million 
the total cost of these licenses was million  or per pop  after the bidding credit 
the us government lent licensees of the net cost of the licenses 
events during and subsequent to the auction  as well as other externally driven technologies and market forces  have made financing of the government installment debt and the development of these licenses through the capital markets much more difficult than previously anticipated 
fortunet  as well as many of the license holders from this auction  has petitioned the fcc for relief in terms of resetting the interest rate to the appropriate rate at the time  further reducing or delaying the required debt payments in order to afford better access to capital markets  and relaxing the restrictions with regard to ownership structure and alternative arrangements in order to afford these small businesses the opportunity to more realistically restructure and build out their systems 
the response from the fcc which was announced on september   and modified on march  afforded license holders a choice of four options  one of which was the resumption of current debt payments which had been suspended earlier this year 
the ramifications of choosing the other three courses of action could result in fortunet ultimately forfeiting either   or of its current investment in these licenses 
on july   fortunet returned of the licenses it was awarded and returned half of the spectrum of the remaining three licenses 
fortunet currently is the licensee for mhz of spectrum in three florida markets tallahassee  panama city  and ocala covering approximately  pops at a cost of per mhz pop equal to per mhz pop 
it used the down payment from the licenses returned  after deducting the forfeited  to repay all remaining government debt 
no further write offs have been recorded as a result of this restructure 
the tax benefit of million  includes federal  state and local taxes and represents an effective rate of versus the effective tax rate in the difference in the effective rates is primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and the amortization of goodwill 
financial condition as of december   the company had current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
working capital was therefore million as compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the two acquisitions at spinnaker which were financed  to a large extent  through the use of spinnaker s working capital line of credit which expires but is classified as a short term facility 
capital expenditures were million in and million in overall capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million above the level due to additional expenditures for the company s kansas telephone operation 
at december   total debt was million  which was million more than the million at the end of  primarily due to the two acquisitions at spinnaker during debt at year end included million of fixed interest rate debt  at an average interest rate of and million of variable interest rate debt at an average interest rate of 
additionally  the company had million in unused lines of credit at december   of which million was attributed to spinnaker  and million of which was attributable to morgan 
as of december   the parent company borrowed million under two short term line of credit facilities with maximum availability totaling million 
these short term lines of credit expire on june  million and december  million 
management anticipates that these lines will be renewed when they expire but there is no assurance that they will be 
backlog in the manufactured products segment at december  was million versus million at the end of included in the backlog at december  was a million glass press order at lynch systems from an international customer 
the customer subsequently canceled this order 
the purchase order associated with this order contained a cancellation provision pursuant to which the customer paid lynch systems million which can be used by the customer as a discount for future orders 
aside from the cancellation at lynch systems referred to above  backlog decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in orders at m tron 
since  the board of directors of lynch has authorized the repurchase of  common shares 
at december   lynch s remaining authorization is to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock 
no shares of stock have been purchased since april on february   the morgan group  inc filed a schedule e  that invites its shareholders to tender up to  shares of class a common stock  to morgan at prices not less than nor greater than per share 
the tender offer expired march   whereby morgan purchased  shares at per share 
lynch has decided not to tender any shares in response to this offer 
the board of directors has adopted a policy not to pay cash dividends and such policy is reviewed annually 
this policy takes into account the long term growth objectives of the company  especially its acquisition program  shareholders desire for capital appreciation of their holdings and the current tax law disincentives for corporate dividend distributions 
accordingly  no cash dividends have been paid since january  and none are expected to be paid in lynch corporation maintains an active acquisition program and generally finances each acquisition with a significant component of debt 
this acquisition debt contains restrictions on the amount of readily available funds that can be transferred to the parent company from its subsidiaries 
as the result of acquisitions  lynch consolidated  spinnaker and certain acquisition subsidiaries have relatively high debt to equity ratios 
for lynch consolidated  total debt to shareholder equity was to  and for spinnaker  consolidated total debt to shareholder equity was to the company has been pursuing segmentation of its businesses  through a spin off of its multimedia and services operations 
a spin off could improve management focus  facilitate and enhance financings and set the stage for future growth  including acquisitions 
a split could also help surface the underlying values of the company as the different business segments appeal to differing value and growth cultures in the investment community 
there are a number of matters to be examined in connection with a spin off  including tax consequences  and there is no assurance that such a spin off will be effected 
the company has a significant need for resources to fund the operations of the holding company and fund future growth 
lynch is currently considering various alternative long and short term financing arrangements 
one such alternative could be to sell a portion or all of certain investments in operating entities either directly or through an exchangeable debt instrument 
additional debt and or equity financing vehicles at corporate and or subsidiaries are also being considered 
while management expects to obtain adequate financing resources to enable the company to meet its obligations  there is no assurance that such can be readily obtained or at reasonable costs 
the company has recently initiated two programs which may effect future operations and cash flow 
a 
cost cutting the company is taking a three step approach to cutting costs 
first is a review to eliminate certain centralized overhead costs 
second  a review of the company s overall financial costs is being undertaken with an objective of achieving savings from refinancing and restructuring certain debt instruments 
third  the company s operating entities will take advantage of cost savings opportunities without sacrificing quality of service 
b 
harvesting the second program is a concentrated effort to monetize the company s assets  including selling a portion or all of certain investments in company s operating entities 
these may include company s minority interest in network affiliated television stations and certain telephone operations where competitive local exchange carrier opportunities are not readily apparent 
company s approximately owned subsidiary  spinnaker  has retained schroder co  inc to seek strategic alternatives  including a possible sale of all or a portion of its business  merger or other combination of spinnaker and or its subsidiaries 
there is no assurance that all or any part of this program can be effected on acceptable terms 
year the company has initiated a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing and conducting an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs or programs utilized by vendors to the company that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculation 
the company s year review is being performed primarily by internal staff  and in certain operations is supplemented by outside consultants 
the principal information technology it systems that may be impacted by the year for the company s telecommunications operations are central office switching  billing and accounting 
the principal it systems for the morgan group are order entry dispatch and accounting 
the principal it systems for the company s manufacturing companies are sales order entry  shop floor control  inventory control and accounting 
the year may also impact various non it systems  including among other things security systems  hvac  elevator systems  and communications systems 
in addition  each of the company s businesses may be impacted by the year readiness of third party vendors suppliers 
due to the integral nature of switching equipment and billing software to their operations  the telecommunications businesses are most effected by the year issue 
the majority of the telephone companies switching and billing software is year compliant  with the remaining expected to be compliant by the third quarter of the telecommunications businesses rely on switching equipment and software provided by third party vendors 
it is the company s understanding that the vendors have completed testing of the software and that no additional action by the company will be required after installation 
the telecommunications businesses periodically upgrade switching software in order to remain current with respect to service features 
the upgrades provided other enhanced service features as well as included year readiness and have been capitalized 
other remediation costs  including internal costs have been charged to expense as incurred 
the total cost of year remediation for the telecommunications businesses is estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent to date 
the telecommunications businesses have not developed a contingency plan and are in the process of determining the needs for such a plan 
the morgan group  inc is in the process of remediating the year issue  primarily through the replacement of a significant portion of its operating software 
implementation is expected to be completed by july  with final testing completed by september the total cost of year remediation is estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent to date 
costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software are charged to expense as incurred 
at this time  the morgan group has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan 
the assessment phase for the company s manufacturing businesses is approximately complete 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company has determined that certain of its computer and software used in manufacturing and accounting systems require replacement or modification 
such replacements and modifications are ongoing and estimated to be complete 
the company expects the assessment phase to be completed by june  with testing and remediation complete by september the total cost of year remediation for the manufacturing businesses is estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent to date 
a comprehensive contingency plan has not been completed at this time 
the estimated costs and projected dates of completion for the company s year program are based on management s estimates and were developed using numerous assumptions of future events  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and converting to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company as a whole 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely or are ineffective  the year issue may materially and adversely impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk relating to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amounts of interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments approximately million at december  
the company generally finances the debt portion of the acquisition of long term assets with fixed rate  long term debt 
the company generally maintains the majority of its debt as fixed rate in nature either by borrowing on a fixed long term basis or  on a limited basis  entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future  although the strategies may be reevaluated as market conditions dictate 
at december   approximately million  or of the company s long term debt and notes payable bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings for variable rate debt and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
