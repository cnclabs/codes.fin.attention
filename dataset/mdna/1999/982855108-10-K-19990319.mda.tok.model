 to cdn 
  and on march  increased it by an additional cdn 
 to cdn 
 
these increases were required to assist in refinancing the operating cash requirements of the newly acquired companies and to meet increased working capital requirements 
at december   approximately  was available under the cdn 
 facility 
in addition  approximately  was available to finance future capital expenditures under a revolving credit facility of  cdn 

management believes that future operating cash flows and the unused balance available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements  to repay the term debt and redeem the preferred shares as they become due and to meet cash requirements for capital asset additions 
us operations cash of  was utilized by continuing operations in the united states during working capital increased  primarily due to higher inventories  and lower payables  partially offset by an increase of  in income taxes payable 
the higher inventory levels were at ifc and resulted primarily from a build up of inventories to counter temporary raw material supply shortages 
capital expenditures of continuing operations in amounted to  a total of  of the committed revolving credit facility with congress financial corporation was repaid during management believes that future operating cash flows and unused balance available under the existing credit facility will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements and to finance capital assets additions until the sale of the wyant health care division and to meet its ongoing cash requirements if the sale of the wyant health care division is not consummated 
thereafter  following the repayment of the balance outstanding under the secured line of credit with congress financial corporation  management believes that future operating cash flows and excess cash on hand will be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements and to finance capital asset additions 
discontinued operations on february   the board of directors approved the sale of the company s wyant health care division  subject to completion of buyer financing  customary regulatory approvals and the approval of the company s shareholders  for cash on closing of  and  which will be held in escrow for twenty four months 
these cash proceeds are subject to adjustment on closing  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of results of operations between the measurement date of december  and the closing date are expected to contribute positively to the company s overall results 
cash received on closing will be utilized to pay off the balance under the secured line of credit with congress financial corporation  as at december   pay the withdrawal liability and income taxes generated by the transaction  and temporarily to reduce other outstanding debt 
significant factors and known trends with regard to discontinued operations pension plan certain employees of the wyant health care division are members of a multi employer defined benefit pension plan the plan or pension plan 
the company was informed by the pension plan administrators that the plan had failed to meet minimum legal funding requirements and that the company s pro rata share of the minimum funding deficiency was  the plan has applied to the irs for a waiver from the minimum funding requirements and awaits a response 
if the waiver is obtained  the employers contributing to the plan would be required to fund and charge to earnings the funding deficiency  and corresponding interest charges  over a year period 
if the waiver is not obtained  an excise tax may be imposed on the plan and such excise tax could be as much as of the funding deficiency 
the sale of the wyant health care division will trigger a withdrawal liability as paperpak  the acquirer of the division  will not assume the company s obligation under the plan 
this withdrawal liability will be funded through the proceeds from the sale of the division 
in addition to the withdrawal liability  the plan may also seek to collect the division s pro rata share of the funding deficiency discussed above 
after taking into account these pension plan liabilities  the company estimates that it will realize a gain on the sale of the division 
airlay ii machine in  the division purchased a machine airlay ii for the production of airlaid products 
during  the machine was redesigned for commercial use 
although airlay ii was installed in the branchburg  new jersey manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of  only a small quantity of commercially acceptable product has been manufactured to date 
during the second quarter of  a complete engineering evaluation of the machine was performed 
the division implemented the majority of the recommended changes included in the engineering evaluation 
in december the division developed a business plan that included  as an objective  full commercial operation of airlay ii by the end of airlay ii is part of the assets of the division that wyant has agreed to sell to paperpak 
as of december  the net book value of airlay ii was approximately million 
in the event that the sale of the division is not consummated  there can be no assurance that airlay ii will achieve full commercial operation or produce saleable product for the division 
accordingly  failure to achieve full commercial operation in the near future could result in a significant write down of the company s investment in airlay ii  which write down would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company 
environmental the company has been participating with the new jersey department of environmental protection dep in the investigation and potential clean up of the company s former site of operation located at and easy street  bridgewater  new jersey 
as a tenant  the company is potentially responsible to the dep for environmental contamination based solely upon it having been a tenant at the site where there is contamination 
similarly  the company is potentially jointly and severally liable with the landlord for both the investigation and clean up costs 
to date  the investigation has established that  in addition to on site contamination  some of the contamination on the site is or has come from off site 
the company disputes it caused any such contamination and maintains that on site contamination was a result of prior tenants acts 
nevertheless  the company has fully cooperated with the dep and has presently been directed by the dep to delineate the ground water contaminant plume  which may result in establishing that the contamination is a regional problem rather than one specific to the former site that the company leased 
the company has entered into a flat fee contract with its environmental consultants for  for the delineation investigation 
upon determination of the contaminant plume  the company will petition the dep for a classification exception area where the remedial action will be natural attenuation 
after the investigation is completed  the dep could require clean up or remediation of the contamination on site  the cost of which could potentially be in the range of  to  however  present technology is such that no remedial action plan could bring the site in conformity with the present dep regulations  regardless of the funds spent 
the company is unaware of any other environmental or similar matters that would have a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company 
backlog  impact of inflation  seasonality the company attempts to maintain sufficient inventory levels for all products to allow shipment against most orders for wiping products within a one week period and next day for core stocking items of the company s sanitation products 
to some extent  however  certain components must be inventoried further in advance of actual orders to ensure availability 
for the most part  purchases are based upon quarterly requirements as projected after calculating sales indications from the sales and marketing departments 
the company s products are not subject to significant seasonal influences 
because its products are sold primarily to distributors throughout the united states and to distributors and end users in canada  the company is affected by general economic conditions 
accordingly  any adverse change in the economic climate may have an adverse impact on the company s sales and financial condition 
year the year problem arises because many computer systems and software products currently in use are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
four digit entries will be required to identify st century dates 
consequently  the use of software and computer systems that are not year compliant could result in the disruption of operations 
as a result  many companies computer systems and software may need to be upgraded or replaced to conform with year requirements 
in order to properly address the year issue  the company has appointed the vice president  information technology of wood wyant as year project director to direct a project team which will identify year issues and coordinate solutions 
the project team is currently being assembled 
its role will be to conduct year readiness assessment audits at all of the company s facilities  encompassing all equipment and processes deemed important to the facility s operation 
contingency plans will also be developed 
wood wyant has installed new applications software for which it has obtained written confirmation from the vendor that it is year compliant 
this software has become operational in the first quarter of the software currently in use at ifc is not year compliant and will be replaced by hardware and applications software which will be year compliant by mid as an additional precaution  the technical infrastructure of all the company s businesses will be audited and tested to ensure year compliance under normal business conditions 
the total cost of purchasing and installing the new wood wyant software is estimated to be  cdn 
 and is being financed through lease facilities established with the bank of nova scotia 
the cost to replace computer hardware and applications software at ifc has not yet been determined but is not expected to be material 
the company is also preparing to issue year compliance letters requesting confirmation of suppliers readiness and follow up discussions will take place for all business critical suppliers 
major customers will also be contacted to confirm their year readiness 
to date  the company has not incurred significant incremental costs in order to comply with year requirements and does not believe it will incur significant incremental costs in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that year errors or defects will not be discovered in the company s software systems and  if errors or defects are discovered  there is no assurance that this would not result in a material financial risk to the company 
in addition  the company purchases goods and services from third party vendors that may not be year compliant 
while the company intends to obtain confirmation of vendors state of readiness  their failure to operate properly with regard to year requirements could require the company to incur material expenses to rectify the impact on the company of such failure 
however  all of the company s raw materials are widely available and the company is not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers 
the company does not know the state of preparedness for year issues of all of its customers 
however  no single customer exceeds of consolidated sales and therefore the risk the company faces is broad based if many customers are unable to use information systems necessary to place orders for company products 
the company plans to achieve year compliance by mid item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk principally in two areas  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk the company s lines of credit and long term debt are all at rates of interest which fluctuate with changes to bank prime rates in either the united states or canada 
consequently  increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s results of operations are significantly dependent on  and materially affected by  the results of operations of wood wyant and the attendant business risks that are associated with the operation of wood wyant as a going concern 
these material risks include the following a significant portion of the company s earnings  on a consolidated basis  will come from wood wyant  a canadian corporation 
as a result  the company s results of operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the fluctuation in the currency exchange rate between us and canadian dollars 
since wood wyant conducts its business using canadian dollars as its operational currency  to the extent the canadian dollar strengthens against the us dollar  united states competitors in the institutional sanitation business may become more active in the canadian market 
as a result  the company s results of operations and earnings may be adversely affected in light of potential greater competition in times of a stronger canadian dollar
