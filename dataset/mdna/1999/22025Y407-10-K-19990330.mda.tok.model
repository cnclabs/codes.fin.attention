revenues for operation of correctional and detention facilities are recognized as the services are provided  based on a gross rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate 
of cca s domestic facilities in operation at the time of the cca merger  were compensated on a per diem basis and one was compensated at fixed monthly rates 
the per diem rates or fixed monthly rates vary according to the type of facility and the extent of services provided at the facility 
cca had certain contracts which provided for the realization of operating bonuses which are contingent upon various criteria

the most significant component of these costs related to the hiring and training of experienced corrections and administrative personnel necessary for the implementation and maintenance of the facility management and transportation contracts 
operating income for each facility depended upon the relationship between operating costs  the rate at which cca was compensated per manday  and the occupancy rate 
the rates of compensation were fixed by contract and approximately two thirds of all operating costs were fixed costs 
therefore  operating income varied from period to period as occupancy rates fluctuated 
operating income was affected adversely as cca increased the number of newly constructed or expanded facilities under management and experienced initial low occupancy rates 
after a management contract was awarded  cca incurred facility start up costs that consisted principally of initial employee training  travel and other direct expenses incurred in connection with the contract 
prior to the adoption of sop as of january   these costs were capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the contract plus renewals or five years 
depending on the contract  start up costs were either fully recoverable as pass through costs or were billable to the contracting agency over the initial term of the contract plus renewals 
cca historically financed start up costs through available cash  the issuance of various securities  cash from operations and borrowings under cca s revolving credit facility 
newly opened facilities were staffed according to contract requirements when cca began receiving inmates 
inmates were typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a regulated  structured basis over a one to three month period 
until expected occupancy levels were reached  operating losses may have been incurred

year compliance the year issue generally relates to computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in those programs  the year may be incorrectly identified as the year  which can result in a system failure or miscalculations causing a disruption of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare financial statements or engage in other normal business activities 
the following discussion identifies the actions taken by the company and operating company to assess and address the year issues faced by both companies 
the company has completed an initial assessment and remediation of its key information technology systems including its client server and minicomputer hardware and operating systems and critical financial and nonfinancial applications 
based on this initial assessment  the company believes that these key information technology systems are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future 
the company is in the process of evaluating the remaining noncritical information technology systems for year compliance 
the company depends upon the proper functioning of third party computer and non information technology systems 
these third parties include commercial banks and other lenders  construction contractors  architects and engineers and vendors such as the providers of telecommunications and utilities 
the company has initiated communications with third parties with whom it has important financial or operational relationships to determine the extent to which they are vulnerable to the year issue 
the company has not yet received sufficient information from all parties about their remediation plans to predict the outcome of their efforts 
the company is currently developing a contingency plan that is expected to address financial and operational problems that might arise on and around january  this contingency plan would include establishing additional sources of liquidity that could be drawn upon in the event of systems disruption and identifying alternative vendors and back up processes that do not rely on computers  whenever possible 
the company s key information technology systems were year compliant when acquired in the merger 
as such  the company has incurred no expenses through december  and expects to incur no material costs in the future on year remediation efforts 
because operating company is the lessee of a substantial majority of the company s facilities  the company may be vulnerable to operating company s failure to remedy its year issues 
the failure of operating company to remedy its year problems could result in the delayed collection of lease payments by the company  potentially resulting in liquidity stress 
operating company s year compliance program is focused on addressing year readiness in the following areas i operating company s information technology hardware and software  ii material non information technology systems  iii year compliance of third parties with which operating company has a material relationship  iv systems used to track and report assets not owned by operating company eg inmate funds and personal effects  and v development of contingency plans 
operating company  and prior to the completion of the merger cca  has completed an initial assessment and remediation of its key information technology systems including its client server and minicomputer hardware and operating systems and critical financial and nonfinancial applications 
remediation efforts as of the date hereof include upgrades of operating company s minicomputer hardware and critical financial applications 
based on this initial assessment and remediation efforts  operating company believes that these key information technology systems are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future 
operating company is in the process of evaluating the remaining noncritical information technology systems for year compliance 
operating company manages and operates facilities it owns  facilities it leases from prison realty  and facilities owned by and leased from government entities 
operating company is currently evaluating whether the material non information technology systems such as security control equipment  fire suppression equipment and other physical plant equipment at both the facilities it owns and the facilities it leases from prison realty are year compliant 
operating company will also request that the owners of the government facilities it manages provide year certification for material information technology and non information technology systems at those facilities 
all operating company s managed correctional facilities  as a part of general operating policy  have existing contingency plans that are deployed in the event key operational systems  such as security control equipment fail eg when a power failure occurs 
in addition  the correctional facilities key security systems are fail secure systems which automatically lock down and are then operated manually should the related electronic components fail 
therefore  operating company management believes no additional material risks associated with the physical operation of its correctional facilities are created as a result of potential year issues 
operating company depends upon the proper functioning of third party computer and non information technology systems 
these third parties include government agencies for which operating company provides services  commercial banks and other lenders  construction contractors  architects and engineers  and vendors such as providers of food supplies and services  inmate medical services  telecommunications and utilities 
operating company has initiated communications with third parties with whom it has important financial or operational relationships to determine the extent to which they are vulnerable to the year issue 
operating company has not yet received sufficient information from all parties about their remediation plans to predict the outcome of their efforts 
if third parties with whom operating company interacts have year problems that are not remedied  the following problems could result i in the case of construction contractors and architects and engineers  in the delayed construction of correctional facilities  ii in the case of vendors  in disruption of important services upon which operating company depends  such as medical services  food services and supplies  telecommunications and electrical power  iii in the case of government agencies  in delayed collection of accounts receivable potentially resulting in liquidity stress  or iv in the case of banks and other lenders  in the disruption of capital flows potentially resulting in liquidity stress 
operating company is also evaluating year compliance of other software applications used to track and report assets that are not the property of operating company 
this includes applications used to track and report inmate funds and the inmates personal effects 
operating company is currently developing a contingency plan that is expected to address financial and operational problems that might arise on and around january  this contingency plan would include establishing additional sources of liquidity that could be drawn upon in the event of systems disruption and identifying alternative vendors and back up processes that do not rely on computers  whenever possible 
operating company management expects to have the contingency plan completed by mid year operating company has incurred and expects to continue to incur expenses allocable to internal staff  as well as costs for outside consultants  computer systems remediation and replacement and non information technology systems remediation and replacement including validation in order to achieve year compliance 
operating company currently estimates that these costs will total approximately million 
of this total it is estimated that million will be for the repair of software problems and million will be for the replacement of problem systems and equipment 
as of december   cca had incurred  in year program costs 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
management of operating company believes there will be no material impact on operating company s financial condition or results of operations resulting from other information technology projects being delayed due to year efforts 
the costs of operating company s year compliance program and the date on which operating company plans to complete it are based on current estimates  which reflect numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  the timing and effectiveness of third party remediation plans and other factors 
operating company can give no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from operating company s plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct relevant computer source codes and embedded technology  the results of internal and external testing and the timeliness and effectiveness of remediation efforts of third parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in us interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its bank credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the bank credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
if the interest rate for the bank credit facility debt was basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense net of amounts capitalized would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
as of march   the company had outstanding million of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of and million of preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate of 
because the interest and dividend rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical percent decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the company 
similarly  as of march   the company had a note receivable in the amount of million with a fixed interest rate of  the value of which would not be materially impacted by an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
additionally  the company may  from time to time  invest its cash in a variety of short term financial instruments 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and months 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these investments 
the company also uses  or intends to use  long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments  if issued  will typically bear fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company may occasionally enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the company does not have a material exposure to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations related to its operations 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its operations or investment portfolio 
the company does not believe it has any other material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates
