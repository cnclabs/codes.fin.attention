year disclosure the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from the dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date values 
the company expects to be year ready 
year ready means that critical systems  devices  applications or business relationships have been evaluated and are expected to be suitable for continued use into and beyond the year  and that contingency plans are in place to mitigate risks stemming from the failure of other parties to be year ready 
the company began addressing the year issue in the early s by changing its computer systems development standards for new systems to utilize year compliant date storage techniques 
the company is using a multistep approach in conducting its year readiness project 
these steps are inventory  assessment  remediation and verification  and contingency planning 
the first step  an inventory of critical systems and devices with potential year problems was completed in july of the next step  completed in october  was an assessment to determine any necessary changes to ensure year readiness 
the assessment confirmed estimates of  to make central computer systems year ready  and revealed other noninformation systems and equipment requiring additional remediation costs of  the company has completed evaluation  remediation  verification  and implementation of of its internally developed systems 
the remaining internally developed systems were completed in the first quarter of the company is utilizing internal and external resources in its effort to be year ready by mid the company has completed formal communication with third party information systems suppliers to solicit year readiness statements 
forty seven third party information systems suppliers were contacted with the following response indicate that they are compliant now  indicate that compliant versions of their products are available 
the company will implement all but two of these updated versions in the first quarter of  the remaining noncompliant suppliers products will be implemented during the second quarter of noninformation systems areas will be completed in the second quarter of the company has issued formal communication to critical noninformation systems service providers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company can not predict the outcome of other companies remediation efforts  however it has no knowledge that any of these companies will not be year ready 
the company began systems testing in february the company will continue general systems testing to verify that its systems are year ready 
testing will be completed in the second quarter of the company will promptly respond to issues discovered by general systems testing 
contingency plans will be prepared so that the company s critical business processes can be expected to continue to function on january  and beyond 
the company s contingency plans will be structured to address both remediation efforts of systems and their components and overall business operating risk 
these plans are intended to mitigate both internal risks as well as potential risks in the company s supply chain and in maintaining the confidence of its customers 
the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that key suppliers or service providers fail to meet their commitments to the company due to failure on their part or on the part of other underlying business entities to be year ready 
the company has assessed the risks associated with such failures and believes that its contingency plans would mitigate the long term effect of such a scenario 
if a temporary disruption does occur  the company does not expect that it would have a material adverse affect on its financial position and results of operations 
item a

as a result  the company believes that its market risk exposure is not material to the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations
