item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in and during the remainder of the s focused on developing and marketing a software application product for use by roadway design professionals 
in  the company  under new management  began to expand significantly its product line to include complementary software application products for use by a variety of aec professionals 
the expansion of its product line was accomplished through both internal development and through acquisitions 
on january   the company added modules of landscape architecture environmental planning application software as a result of the landcadd acquisition 
on march   the company added modules of geographic information systems software to its product line as a result of the fms acquisition 
on november   the company added modules of structural engineering software as a result of the ecom merger 
on july   the company added modules of building designed construction software as a result of the cibc acquisition 
the landcadd acquisition  the fms acquisition and the cibc acquisition  were each accounted for under the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of operations of such businesses are included in the company s results from their respective dates of acquisition 
for each acquisition  the aggregate cost over the fair value of acquired net assets has been assigned principally to purchased research and development and software development costs based on their estimated fair market values 
the portion of the aggregate purchase prices allocated to research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was charged to expense on the date of purchase 
accordingly  the company s results of operations reflect a non recurring charge for purchased research and development of approximately  for fiscal the ecom merger was accounted for as a pooling of interest  however  it did not have a material effect on financial statement and therefore such statements have not been restated 
in autodesk  the company whose cad platform the majority of the company s business is based upon bought softdesk  a major competitor of eagle point 
additionally  in bentley systems  the developer of the microstation cad platform upon which a portion of the company s civil engineering surveying modules are based  purchased an equity interest in geopak  also a competitor of eagle point 
as a result of these situations  eagle point began to compete with companies with whom it previously did not compete 
as further evidence of the increased competitive pressures  during fiscal year  autodesk notified eagle point that eagle point would no longer be allowed to resell autocad 
autocad resales accounted for approximately  or million  of the company s revenues and  or  of the company s gross profit for fiscal there were no autocad resales in fiscal year the inability to resell autocad has had an adverse effect on the company s revenues and gross profit 
see risk factors competition 
the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades by the company  the company s competitors or autodesk  customer acceptance of software applications  product development expenses  announcements or changes in pricing policies by competitors  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of domestic versus international revenues  the existence of product errors or bugs  and the hiring and training of additional staff could contribute to this variability of quarterly results 
economic and other factors affecting the building  construction  architecture  mapping and engineering industries could also affect demand for the company s products in one or more particular quarters 
a significant portion of the company s net revenues in a quarter are derived from orders received in the latter part of that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
as the markets in which the company competes mature and new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could affect quarterly operating results

fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues increased million  or to million for the fiscal year ended june  the period  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the period 
the company experienced an increase in product sales and in training and support revenues 
while product sales increased slightly overall  the portion of product sales attributable to eagle point products as opposed to the resale of third party products increased million or to million in the period from million in the period primarily as the result of the release of new products and product upgrades 
this increase in eagle point product sales offset the decrease in the resales of third party products from million in the period to million in the period 
the decrease of the resales of third party products was due to the company no longer being authorized to resale autocad as of the end of the third quarter in the period 
 of the third party resales during the period were represented by resales of intellicad 
in july  visio corporation announced that by the end of calendar year they were no longer going to offer a commercial version of intellicad  but rather create a non profit open source consortium and will offer the intellicad product and source code free to end users 
as a result  the company does not expect to generate significant revenues from the resale of intellicad in the future 
training and support revenues were favorably affected in the period by the release of the new products and product upgrades as well as an increased emphasis by the company on support and maintenance programs 
 of the period s software revenues that were part of a continuing upgrade promotion were deferred 
additionally  million of previously deferred software revenues were recognized during the period as the product upgrades  for which the revenue was initially deferred  were shipped 
despite the increase in revenues  the company is becoming aware of certain conditions in the market place which could have a potential adverse affect on the company s business in the future 
certain other companies in the market place have indicated that their results of operations have been adversely impacted by declining demand from their customers who have focused their automation spending on internet initiatives and yk preparedness

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in the period from in the period 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues relating to product sales increased to in the period from in the period 
this increase is attributable to a shift in the mix of product sales

the increase in interest was primarily attributed to higher balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the company s effective tax rate for the period increased to from for the period 
the primary reason for this is due to lower research and development tax credits as a percentage of overall tax expense due to higher income levels in the period compared to the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues decreased million  or to million for the fiscal year ended june  the period  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the period 
the company experienced a decrease in product sales and training and supports sales  as a result of many factors  including a changing competitive environment resulting from the merger between autodesk and softdesk and the equity investment in geopak by bentley systems 
difficulty in the marketplace is further compounded by delays in upgrades to certain eagle point products as a result of a need to focus  during and much of  on addressing quality issues surrounding autodesk s november introduction of it s autocad release product 
in addition   of software revenues that were part of a continuing upgrade promotion  were deferred and therefore not recognized in the period 
the revenues deferred under this promotion will be recognized upon the future release and subsequent shipment of the product upgrades

gross profit margin from product sales was aided by an increase in gross profit margins on eagle point products  which was primarily attributable to a reduction in costs associated with the implementation of cd rom technology and electronic documentation 
gross profit relating to product sales was also adversely impacted in the period due to the  write down of capitalized software to more accurately reflect anticipated future revenues from certain products 
gross profit as a percentage of corresponding net revenues relating to training and support increased to in the period from in the period  primarily due to an improvement in the sales mix toward support and maintenance revenues  which carry higher gross profit margins than training revenues

liquidity and capital resources the company s financial position remains strong  with working capital of million and long term debt of only  cash  short term and long term investments aggregated approximately million at june  the company also has available a million unsecured line of credit from it s principal commercial bank 
at june   the company had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
to date  the company has not entered into any interest rate  currency or other market risk hedging instruments inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  nor does the company expect it to have a significant impact in fiscal year the company has experienced insignificant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions since substantially all of its international sales to date have been billed in us dollars 
as the company continues to expand its international operations it may begin billing in foreign currencies which would increase the company s exposure to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts if deemed appropriate at that time 
impact of the year issue the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
computer systems based on a two digit format will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the company believes that it has four general areas of potential exposure with respect to the yk problem its own software products  internal informational systems  computer hardware and other equipment related systems  and external 
based on the company s analysis through september   the company does not believe that the yk issue will materially affect its business or involve material costs to the company 
the company s most current version of its software products have been tested and confirmed to be yk compliant 
previous product versions  as well as products that the company no longer actively sells  have not been tested for yk compliance 
accordingly  no assurance can be given as to such prior products yk compliance status 
in addition  since many of the company s products run in conjunction with rd party products such as autocad  microstation and intellicad  their yk compatibility can be dependent on the year compatibility of those rd party products 
according to public statement made by the manufacturers of autocad  microstation and intellicad  recent versions of these products are yk compliant 
however  these companies gave no assurances as to the yk compliance of significantly older versions of their respective products 
in  the company developed a systematic plan to evaluate its yk exposure with respect to its internal informational systems 
in accordance with this plan  the company identified systems pursuant to which the company could have exposure and performed remediation procedures to correct these systems 
all remediation activities have been completed and preliminary testing of the internal information systems in a simulated yk environment has been completed 
the third type of potential yk exposure relates to the company s computer hardware and other equipment related systems such as the company s workstations  servers and phone system 
the company has identified and evaluated such systems yk exposure and remediation procedures have been completed 
the fourth aspect of the company s yk analysis involves evaluating major vendors yk exposure and their efforts to address such exposure 
the company has obtained documentation and certification from most vendors regarding their yk compliance 
based upon the vendors who have responded  which includes substantially all material vendors  it appears that there is no material yk exposure to the company 
however  if the company determines  after receiving additional responses to the aforementioned inquiries  that its vendors yk issues could result in material disruptions to their respective businesses  the company may seek alternative suppliers 
based upon the evaluation  remediation and testing activities described above  we believe the company s most recent product versions  internal systems  computer hardware and other equipment systems will be yk compliant 
however  as identified above  our testing can only simulate the year accordingly  the company can not guarantee that it will be free from yk problems
