item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company classifies its sales into two product groups engineered papers including tobacco papers  and specialized printing papers 
the glatfelter division  which includes the spring grove  pennsylvania and neenah  wisconsin paper mills  produces both specialized printing and engineered papers 
the ecusta division is comprised of the pisgah forest  north carolina paper mill hereinafter referred to as ecusta 
schoeller hoesch s h includes the gernsbach  germany paper mill and a controlling ownership interest in a paper mill in odet  france 
both ecusta and s h produce specialized printing papers and engineered papers including tobacco papers 
s h was acquired on january  excluding tobacco papers  demand for most of the company s engineered papers remained relatively strong during and pricing for such products remained relatively stable 
however  the company did experience some market related downtime at its s h locations in the fourth quarter of related to its engineered papers  including its long fiber papers 
as a result of this weakening of demand  average selling prices for these papers decreased slightly during the fourth quarter 
current backlog levels are strong for the company s other engineered papers 
demand for the company s tobacco papers was very weak during increased tobacco paper capacity in china  along with stagnant growth in worldwide tobacco product consumption has resulted in excess tobacco paper capacity over current levels of demand 
the company incurred tobacco paper market related downtime at both ecusta and s h during the year 
competition for limited tobacco paper orders has resulted in decreases in selling prices to the company s multinational tobacco paper customers as well as to other regional and governmental purchasers of tobacco papers 
the outlook for tobacco papers continues to be unfavorable 
recent financial settlements agreed to by the us cigarette producers with state attorneys general have led to increased selling prices for tobacco products in the united states and  in turn  decreased demand for tobacco papers 
the company continues its efforts to remain cost competitive within this market and will attempt to offset any lost sales and profitability with sales of specialized printing papers and cost reductions 
most of the company s specialized printing paper products are directed at the uncoated free sheet portion of the industry 
demand for these papers was fairly weak during  resulting in market related downtime at the company s spring grove and ecusta mills 
weak demand and low order backlogs also resulted in inefficient scheduling of the company s production equipment which  with the exception of the neenah mill  resulted in reduced production levels compared to pricing for the company s printing paper products was unfavorably impacted by the weak demand as the company competed for limited orders 
on average  pricing for the company s printing paper products was higher in than in due to changes in product mix  however  the average selling price for such products during the fourth quarter of was significantly lower than the average selling price during the fourth quarter of the current outlook for the demand and pricing of the company s printing paper products is unclear 
selling price increases have recently been announced in some of the commodity printing paper markets in which the company competes 
the company has announced selling price increases for some of its papers but it is uncertain as to whether such increases will be realized 
the paper industry entered during a continued period of market uncertainty 
the relatively weak market for pulp  the primary raw material used in the production of paper  coupled with ongoing financial difficulties in southeast asia and other parts of the world  provide a climate in which it continues to be difficult to predict the future direction of the u 
s 
and international paper markets 
the company s orientation toward engineered papers should help mitigate the potential negative impact of any further downturn in the international and u 
s 
paper markets 
the company s spring grove mill s gravure coater g coater had its first full year of operation in sales from the g coater were disappointing during  however  the company has reorganized its new product development department to expedite the development of these engineered papers 
such papers typically have higher profit margins than the company s other products 
demand and pricing for engineered papers have historically not fluctuated to the same extent as commodity papers 
acquisition of schoeller hoesch on january   the company acquired s h which owns and operates a paper mill in gernsbach  germany and has a controlling ownership interest in a paper mill in odet  france 
s h also has a pulpmill in the philippines which supplies abaca pulp to s h s paper mills 
in addition  it owns and operates other facilities in wisches  france and summerville  south carolina 
s h primarily manufactures engineered papers and has the leading position in the world tea bag paper market 
it also manufactures other engineered papers including tobacco  metalized  stencil  filter and casing papers  as well as some specialized printing papers 
the acquisition of s h represents a significant step in the company s long term strategic plan  which emphasizes growth in engineered paper markets 
it provides the company with a strong business position in the world tea bag paper market and a presence in other long fiber markets  such as stencil  filter and casing papers 
it also strengthens the company s tobacco papers business by providing a manufacturing presence in europe and a significant share of the european tobacco papers market  plus the ability to manufacture and market ultraporous plug wrap  a growing segment of the world tobacco papers market 
compared to net sales in increased  or  compared to net sales volume and average selling prices decreased at the company s glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
the resulting decrease in net sales at these divisions was more than offset by the net sales of s h 
sales of engineered papers including tobacco papers increased by in versus this increase is due to the inclusion of s h in s results 
overall  the sales volume of engineered papers increased by 
the average net selling price per ton for the company s engineered papers increased significantly due to a shift in product mix 
s h produces and sells lightweight papers and  as a result  has higher average net selling prices per ton than those of the glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
the average net selling price per ton of tobacco papers decreased in versus overall  tobacco paper sales volume increased due to the inclusion of s h s results in specialized printing paper sales were down less than in versus this decrease was due to lower printing paper sales volume 
average net selling prices per ton increased slightly 
this increase was entirely due to a change in product mix 
average selling prices per ton for non s h printing papers decreased slightly in compared to profit from operations before the unusual item  interest income and expense and taxes was  in compared to  in this increase was due to the incremental operating results of s h which more than offset decreases in profit from operations before the unusual item  interest income and expense and taxes at the glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
the decreases at the glatfelter and ecusta divisions were the result of a decrease in net sales  offset somewhat by a decrease in cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in net sales at these two divisions in as compared to was primarily due to reduced sales volumes  exacerbated somewhat by a decrease in average selling price per ton 
the cost of products sold for the glatfelter and ecusta divisions decreased due to a decrease in sales volume and lower costs for certain raw materials in compared to raw material costs had a slightly favorable effect on the company s relative performance in compared to as cost per ton for the company s principal raw materials  market pulp and wastepaper  decreased in versus the company also benefited in from cost savings achieved through the start up of the spring grove mill s precipitated calcium carbonate pcc plant 
this plant reduced the cost of pcc at this mill as well as lowered the need for higher priced raw materials used for increasing the opacity and brightness of certain papers 
the cost of sales per unit decreased at the glatfelter division in versus due primarily to lower raw material costs 
the cost of sales per unit at the ecusta division increased in as compared to this increase was mainly due to the amount of market related downtime taken at the ecusta division and the resulting absorption of fixed costs over fewer units produced 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  this increase was due to the selling  general and administrative expenses related to s h  offset somewhat by a decrease in such expenses at the glatfelter and ecusta divisions 
s h has higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of higher selling costs incurred in delivering product to its customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the company were and of net sales for and  respectively 
interest on investments and other net decreased from  in to  in this decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in investment income in compared to in  the proceeds from the issuance of  of step down preferred stock by a subsidiary  gws valuch  inc  were placed in trust and invested in interest bearing marketable securities  resulting in a significant increase in interest income 
this transaction is described in detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item gain from property dispositions  etc 
net decreased from  in to  in during the second quarter of  the company completed the sale of a parcel of recreational property near its ecusta mill resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately  no property sales of this magnitude are included in the results 
interest on debt was  in compared to  in the primary reason for this increase was the company s higher net borrowing level during the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of  in part due to the borrowings of approximately  under the revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of s h 
the company repaid its  principal amount of its notes on march  unusual item during  the company recognized a pre tax charge of  related primarily to the accrual of pension and medical benefits for certain salaried and hourly employees of the ecusta division and certain salaried employees of the glatfelter division who elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement enhancement program 
the pre tax charge also included the cost of termination of several glatfelter division salaried employees which was necessary to achieve the company s cost savings goals 
the total after tax effect of the unusual item for the year was  or 
per share 
the intent of these programs is to generate annual payroll and benefits cost savings through a reduction in the size of the company s workforce 
the company s restructuring resulted in the elimination of approximately salaried and hourly positions with associated annual pre tax cost savings of approximately  most of the savings will begin to be realized during the first quarter of compared to net sales in increased  or  compared to each of the company s operating facilities achieved increased sales volume which was offset by lower average net selling prices 
engineered paper sales remained relatively flat in as compared to the prior year  increasing by 
tobacco paper sales volume increased by  as an increase in international tobacco paper sales volume of more than offset a decrease in domestic tobacco paper sales volume of 
the average net selling prices for tobacco papers decreased slightly as increases in the average net selling price for domestic tobacco papers were more than offset by a decrease in the average net selling prices of international tobacco papers 
international tobacco paper prices were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the u 
s 
dollar versus most foreign currencies 
international tobacco paper prices also decreased in part due to the acceptance of lower priced  less profitable business to fill machine capacity 
volume increased due to productivity increases  but was offset to a large extent by downtime taken at ecusta for market related reasons  as well as for maintenance and equipment improvements 
average net selling prices for engineered papers excluding tobacco papers remained virtually unchanged during the year as compared to and volume increased marginally in over specialized printing paper sales also remained relatively flat in compared to an increase in sales volume of was offset by a decrease in average net selling prices of 
the increase in sales volume was principally due to an increase in demand for the company s products 
despite the increase in demand for the company s specialized printing papers  pricing for such papers remained under adverse market pressure 
profit from operations before interest income and expense and taxes was  in compared to  in this decrease was the result of a decrease in average net selling prices  a weakening in the product sales mix to less profitable products and an increase in the company s cost of products sold 
the cost of products sold increased due to the increased sales volume  however  the cost of sales per unit did not change significantly 
raw material prices did not significantly affect the company s relative performance in compared to as per ton costs for the company s principal raw materials  market pulp and wastepaper  did not change significantly 
in addition  the company s fixed costs were spread among a greater number of tons in  lowering the cost of sales per unit 
the mix of products sold weakened in versus  particularly at ecusta 
ecusta sold a higher amount of lower priced  lower margin tobacco papers to international customers as well as specialized printing papers 
gross margin per ton decreased by in  a direct result of the change in product mix and lower average net selling prices for certain of the company s products noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  primarily as a result of increased spending on certain legal matters as well as various other professional fees 
the company also increased its spending on information systems to address certain needs  including the impact of year on its existing computer systems and software 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for and  respectively 
interest on debt increased by  and net income from investments and other increased by  this was primarily a result of various financing transactions entered into by the company during as detailed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item financial condition liquidity during  the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased by  this decrease in cash and cash equivalents was principally due to net cash paid for s h of  which exceeded the incremental borrowings of  made to complete the s h acquisition 
other significant sources of cash during included cash provided from operations of  and the net sale of investments of  a majority of the proceeds from the sale of investments was used to pay in full  principal amount of the company s notes along with related interest due 
other significant uses of cash include additions to property  plant and equipment of  and dividend payments of  the company expects to meet all its near term cash needs from a combination of internally generated funds  cash  cash equivalents and its existing revolving credit facility or other bank lines of credit 
the company is subject to certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility 
the company is in compliance with all such covenants 
interest rate risk the company uses its revolving credit facility and notes to finance a significant portion of its operations 
these on balance sheet financial instruments  to the extent they provide for variable rates of interest  expose the company to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the dm libor 
the company uses off balance sheet interest rate swap agreements to partially hedge interest rate exposure associated with on balance sheet financial instruments 
all of the company s derivative financial instrument transactions are entered into for non trading purposes 
to the extent that the company s financial instruments expose the company to interest rate risk and market risk  they are presented in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity for the company s revolving credit facility and notes as of december  for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and the related reference interest rates by year of maturity 
fair values included herein have been determined based upon rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  and estimates obtained from dealers to settle interest rate swap agreements 
the following table should be read in conjunction with notes and to the consolidated financial statements dollar amounts in thousands in item year of maturity total due at fair value at thereafter maturity debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate interest rate swap agreements variable to fixed swaps       average pay rate average receive rate capital resources during  the company expended  on capital projects 
most of these expenditures were for maintenance related projects  however  those expenditures included spending related to the completion of the g coater approximately  in and the precipitated calcium carbonate plant approximately  in  both at the spring grove mill 
the company also expended funds related to the rebuild of one of s h s paper machines  enhancing its ability to produce engineered papers 
the total cost of this project is expected to be  of this amount  approximately  was spent during and approximately  is expected to be expended in the company estimates a total of approximately  will be spent on capital projects during environmental matters the company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from regulation by various federal  state  local and foreign governmental authorities with respect to the environmental impact of air and water emissions and noise from its mills  as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
to comply with environmental laws and regulations  the company has incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures over the past several years 
during  and  the company incurred approximately   and  respectively  in operating costs related to complying with environmental laws and regulations 
the company anticipates that environmental regulation of the company s operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures will continue  and perhaps increase  in the future 
in addition  the company may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment resulting from its operations  including the restoration of natural resources  and liability for personal injury and damage to property  including natural resources 
in particular  the company continues to negotiate with the state of wisconsin and the united states regarding natural resources damages and response costs related to the discharge of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and other hazardous substances in the lower fox river  on which the company s neenah mill is located 
the cost of such damages and response costs is presently unknown but could be substantial and perhaps exceed the company s available resources as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management s current assessment  after consultation with legal counsel  is that such expenditures are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or liquidity  but could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations in a given year  however  there can be no assurance that the company s reserves will be adequate or that a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or liquidity will not occur at some future time 
year the company continues to make progress and  with the exception of some isolated systems at its neenah mill  is on schedule in its efforts to achieve year compliance for its critical systems by the end of the first quarter of the company expects to achieve year compliance on its non critical systems by the end of the second quarter of the company has information technology systems and noninformation technology systems 
the company s information technology systems include both internally and externally developed business systems 
nearly all of the company s business systems have been developed internally 
non information technology systems include computer process control equipment as well as embedded technology  such as micro controllers  which are critical to the operation of production equipment and facilities 
the company s three phase approach to achieve its internal year compliance includes an inventory phase  an assessment phase and a modifications and testing phase 
the company has completed the inventory phase for all of its information technology and non information technology systems 
the company has also completed a significant portion of both the assessment phase and modifications and testing phase for all of its systems 
the remaining system assessments  modifications and related testing are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of with the exception of a small number of non critical systems which should be completed by the end of the second quarter of in addition  the assessment  modification and testing of some isolated critical systems at the neenah mill will not occur until the third quarter of this delay is due to the desire to coincide any machine downtime required to meet year compliance with planned maintenance downtime to minimize disruption to the operation of the mill 
the company has used internal information technology personnel almost exclusively to inventory  assess  modify and test existing systems and has primarily incurred only normal wage  benefit and related costs for its normal complement of information technology personnel 
the company expensed approximately  and  during and  respectively  in such costs supporting its year compliance efforts 
the company estimates it will incur  for these internal costs during to complete its year efforts 
the company s use of its own information technology personnel to make its systems year compliant has and will continue to delay some other strategic information systems development and implementation which would have otherwise benefited the company in various ways and to various extents 
the company does not believe that it will be at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these delays 
to date  the company has made minor capital expenditures to replace certain systems or equipment which were not year compliant 
the company estimates that between  and  in capital related costs will be incurred by the end of the first quarter of to achieve year compliance of its information and non information technology systems 
the company relies significantly on selected key vendors of raw materials  energy  telecommunications and other vital services 
the company also generates significant revenues from various key customers 
the company continues its efforts in addressing year compliance by key third parties by making inquiries to all such third parties and assessing the responses received 
inquiries have been sent to all identified key third parties 
to date  no significant issues have been discovered 
the company hopes to have received and assessed all responses by the end of the first quarter of should the company s assessment of the responses or non responses to its inquiries of key third parties indicate that unacceptable risks exist  or should the risk of inaccuracies of such responses be too great  the company will develop and implement contingency plans to minimize the impact on its operations 
the company intends to have any such plans in place by the end of the third quarter of despite such contingency plans  it is reasonably possible that  in the worst case  some of the company s key vendors or customers could experience operational interruptions as a result of non compliance of their systems 
as a result  the company may be forced to interrupt the operation of one or more of its mills or be required to increase its costs or decrease its selling prices to remain operational 
in such an event  the company s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected
