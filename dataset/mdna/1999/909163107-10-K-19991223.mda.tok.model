net cash used in investing activities of the company in fiscal was approximately million as compared to approximately million used during fiscal the primary use of cash during fiscal and fiscal was to purchase property  plant and equipment 
the fiscal capital spending is primarily related to the modernization of the polycast acrylics facility in stamford  connecticut

the company believes that cash from its operations and its ability to borrow under the revolving credit facilities mentioned above provide it sufficient liquidity to finance its existing level of operations and meet its debt service obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s operations together with amounts available under its revolving credit facilities will continue to be sufficient to finance its existing level of operations and meet its debt service obligations 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations depends on its future performance  which in turn  is subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such refinancing or additional financing 
effects of inflation the markets in which the company sells products are competitive 
in particular  the company has encountered effective resistance to price increases in connection with its sales of acrylics to the aerospace industry 
thus  in an inflationary environment the company might not in all instances be able to pass through to consumers general price increases  in which event the company s operations may be materially impacted if such conditions were to occur 
the company has not in the past been adversely impacted by general price inflation 
year many software applications and operational programs written in the past were not designed to recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the failure of such applications or systems to properly recognize the dates beginning in the year could result in miscalculations or system failures which could result in an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has instituted a year task force that reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company has also initiated a comprehensive project  overseen by the task force  to prepare its computer systems  communication systems and manufacturing testing equipment for the year the project primarily includes three phases which are identification and assessment of all software  hardware and equipment that could potentially be affected by the year issue  remedial action necessary to bring such systems into compliance and further testing  if necessary 
the company has completed all phases of its year project related to facilities  manufacturing processes and communications 
central system modifications have been largely complete since june of with final completion of all year remedies scheduled by december  the company has primarily used internal resources in its year project thus far and has incurred costs of less than  the company has also contacted critical suppliers of products and services and customers to determine the extent to which the company might be vulnerable to such parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
the company does not have a concentration of dependence on these parties 
the effect  if any  on the company s results of operations from the failure of such parties to be year ready is not reasonably estimable 
the company has formulated contingency plans with respect to its reasonably likely worst case scenario which is the unavailability of critical raw materials 
the contingency plans for critical raw materials include alternate materials or sources and advance inventory purchases of certain materials 
forward looking information the information provided herein may contain forward looking statements relating to future events that involve risks and uncertainties 
among the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements are cancellations  rescheduling or delays in product shipments  manufacturing capacity constraints  lengthy sales and qualification cycles  difficulties in the production process  the effectiveness of the company s capital expenditure programs  the future financial performance of the company  delays in developing and commercializing new products  increased competition  the variability of future operating results of the company  changes in the industries in which the company competes or plans to compete  especially the high performance plastics and high brightness  light emitting diode industries  including overall growth of the industries and the continued acceptance of the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its floating rate long term debt and revolving credit advances 
the company s risk management policy includes the use of derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposure 
the counter parties are major financial institutions 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at september   the company had outstanding swap agreements  maturing at various dates through  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under these agreements the company receives a floating rate based on usd libor bba and pays a fixed weighted average interest rate of 
these swaps effectively change the company s payment of interest on million of its million variable rate debt at september  to fixed rate debt 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
at september   the company would have received approximately  to terminate the agreements 
a decrease of basis points in the yield curve would result in a payment by the company of approximately million to terminate the agreement 
the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates 
at september   approximately million of the company s floating rate long term debt and revolving credit advances was not covered under an interest swap agreement 
for floating rate debt  interest changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant 
based upon this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis
