item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview lone star s revenues are derived from steel s three business segments oilfield products  specialty tubing products  and flat rolled steel and other tubular products and services 
products and markets 
the oilfield products business includes the manufacture  marketing and sales of octg  the casing and tubing used in oil and gas well drilling and production  and line pipe that is used to gather and transport oil and gas from the well site to storage or refining facilities 
steel is one of the largest domestic producers and suppliers of octg  based on data compiled by the american iron steel institute 
historically  octg has represented approximately three fourths of steel s oilfield products volume as measured in tonnage  and exports have ranged from approximately to of this segment s shipments during the last three years 
demand for oilfield products is generally affected by customers expectations of future oil and gas prices and political factors such as energy and trade policies 
a key indicator of domestic demand is the average number of drilling rigs operating in the united states 
according to baker hughes  the average united states rig counts in   and were   and  respectively 
however  the decline in drilling activity accelerated in the second half of and by year end only rigs were active compared to  at the end of steel s open orders for octg at december  were down from the prior year due to the decline in drilling activity and high industry wide octg inventories 
demand is also affected by the amount of oilfield products imported into this country as well as available industry inventories 
imported octg accounted for approximately of the apparent supply available to the domestic octg market during  during  during and  as compared to in the level of imported octg increased during due to dislocations of inventories from certain foreign competitors whose traditional markets were encroached upon by other foreign manufacturers  particularly those subject to us trade tariffs  as global drilling activity declined 
a reduction of imported octg in the to period from levels experienced in the to period resulted from the imposition of protective tariffs on certain foreign countries in these trade tariffs  which were intended to promote an equitable trade environment  remained in effect during the effect of available inventory was significant last year as new mill production of octg was largely displaced during the second half of the year by consumption of excess industry wide inventories 
the volatility of oil and gas prices creates uncertainty with respect to the timing and extent of activity in the energy sector 
this affects customer confidence in the longer term outlook for energy prices and directly affects drilling activity 
consequently  domestic markets deteriorated in as oil and gas prices declined to levels that did not justify additional exploration and production spending 
substantial uncertainty exists regarding the future levels of oil and gas prices and related drilling activity 
therefore  no assurance can be given regarding the extent of future demand for steel s octg products 
steel s specialty tubing products segment includes two product groups drawn over mandrel dom tubing and as welded tubing 
specialty tubing consists of a wide array of high quality  custom made steel tubular products requiring critical tolerances  precise dimensional control  and special metallurgical properties 
these products are used in the further manufacture of automotive  construction  and other industrial equipment such as hydraulic cylinders  stabilizer tubes and intrusion tubes  and machine parts 
specialty tubing is used in a wide range of industrial applications and  therefore  demand is sensitive to general economic conditions 
demand decreased during and open orders were down at year end as compared to year end international shipments were lower in due to lower economic activity in certain asian countries 
also  orders for specialty tubing used as hydraulic cylinders were lower due to reduced demand for construction equipment in certain asian countries and decreased domestic agricultural equipment demand 
international shipments of dom specialty tubing were   and of shipments in   and  respectively 
steel s participation in the flat rolled steel commodity market is generally concentrated in the southwestern region of the united states and is affected by factors such as price  capacity utilization  and raw material costs 
flat rolled steel produced by steel is primarily used by steel in the manufacture of tubular products  but is also sold to customers for the manufacture of a variety of commercial and industrial products 
flat rolled steel is sold in highly competitive markets  with price  quality  and availability primarily determining customer purchase decisions 
due to an influx of inexpensive imported flat rolled steel during  markets for flat rolled steel experienced excess supply and lower pricing 
as a result  steel s shipment volumes were down in however  preliminary antidumping tariffs on certain foreign countries were imposed shortly after year end which should provide some relief to domestic markets 
manufacturing 
the manufacture of steel s products is capital intensive 
utilization rates declined significantly during at steel s manufacturing facilities 
operations of certain facilities were curtailed for significant periods during the second half of the level of production volume through steel s various facilities has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing 
key variable costs include costs of raw materials  including scrap steel  steel slabs  coils  electricity  and natural gas 
steel has entered into certain marketing alliances and manufacturing arrangements with unrelated companies involving the marketing of their products and processing of flat rolled steel provided by steel into tubular products which provides steel access to additional manufacturing capacity 
results of operations consolidated revenues reported in the statements of earnings are as follows in millions oilfield products revenues specialty tubing products revenues flat rolled steel and other tubular revenues consolidated net revenues shipments of products by segment are as follows in tons oilfield products    specialty tubing products    flat rolled steel and other tubular products    total tons shipped    compared with net revenues of million were lower than net revenues from oilfield products declined to million in shipment volumes and prices were down from levels and  respectively 
demand for steel s octg decreased as drilling activities declined precipitously in the second half of the average rig count was down to in with only rigs operating at year end  compared to  at the end of demand was also detrimentally impacted as new mill production was replaced by the consumption of excess industry wide octg inventories 
also  demand declined due to increased competition from imported octg which grew to of the apparent supply available to the domestic market from in specialty tubing products revenues decreased by to million from lower shipment volumes with slightly higher prices 
shipment volumes were down due to reduced sales for hydraulic cylinder applications in agricultural and construction related equipment and reduced international sales to certain asian countries 
flat rolled steel and other tubular products revenues were down to million 
shipments were lower due to a dramatic increase in inexpensive imported foreign coils during that resulted in an excess supply of flat rolled steel in domestic markets 
gross earnings decreased from million in to million in due to reduced shipment volumes in all products coupled with lower prices for oilfield products and slightly higher prices for specialty tubing products 
also  significantly decreased production volumes negatively impacted gross margins as fixed and semi fixed costs were absorbed by fewer units of production 
special charges 
in response to late and expected market conditions  steel has restructured and downsized its operations 
the lower operating rates resulted in the need to reduce employment levels and initiate other actions 
as a result of these actions  special charges of million have been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  which include the following items in millions write down of property  plant  and equipment and related supplies to fair value renegotiated or cancelled contractual obligations employee severance cost million of which has been paid total special charges certain facilities are expected to permanently reduce or eliminate their operations  relying instead on alternative production or procurement methods 
this includes a reduction in the production level of the electric arc furnace steelmaking facilities  with heavier reliance to be placed on purchased steel in coil and slab form 
additionally  some finishing processes and infrastructure utility services have or are expected to be permanently abandoned and be completely replaced through outside procurement 
these actions triggered an assessment of the recoverability of the asset carrying costs and the resulting recognition of an impairment loss 
the determination of the impairment loss was based on an evaluation of future cash flows from operation of the steelmaking facilities and estimated salvage values of the steelmaking facilities and those facilities to be abandoned 
the net book value of these assets  which included property  plant and equipment supplies inventory  totaled million  of which million is included in the special charges 
certain existing supplier contracts are also being renegotiated or cancelled to accommodate the lower operating levels 
estimated costs of million associated with renegotiating or cancelling these obligations that will provide no future benefit have been included in the special charges and accrued at december  steel has terminated employees or identified certain positions for elimination as of december  payments made to terminated employees are based on steel s standard severance package 
total employee severance costs included in special charges totaled million  of which million had been paid by december  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million due primarily to continued higher spending related to year readiness initiatives partially offset by lower selling expenses 
interest income decreased from million in to million in due to lower average interest rates on invested cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to the conversion of lone star s million principal amount convertible subordinated debentures into common stock in august of also  steel s revolving credit facility during had lower average interest rates which were offset by higher average borrowings than in other expense 
during  other expense of million was primarily related to write off of prepaid bank fees on the restructuring of steel s revolving credit facility partially offset by gains from nonrecurring miscellaneous items 
in other income of million consisted of nonrecurring miscellaneous items 
loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  included million  or 
per diluted share  in special charges 
excluding special charges  the loss from continuing operations was million  or 
per diluted share  compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share 
the loss was due to lower shipment volumes for all products  particularly oilfield products  coupled with lower prices for oilfield products partially offset by slightly higher prices for specialty tubing products 
also  significantly decreased production volumes negatively impacted operating margins as fixed and semi fixed costs were absorbed by fewer units of production 
extraordinary item of million  or 
per diluted share  was realized on the gain from cancellation of all future obligations under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of act 
during extraordinary items totaling a net gain of million  or 
per diluted share  consisted of a gain of million for the downward adjustment of obligations under the act  partially offset by an extraordinary prepayment charge of million on the refinancing of steel s credit facility 
net loss of million  or per diluted share  included special charges of million which were reflected in the loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  and partially offset by an extraordinary gain of million  or 
per diluted share 
compared with net revenues of million increased over net revenues from oilfield products improved to million in shipment volumes and prices were up from levels by and  respectively 
demand for steel s octg rose as land based drilling increased in this was reflected in the average domestic rig count which increased to in from in demand was also favorably impacted by the reduction in imported octg resulting from the continuation of duties imposed on products from certain countries 
specialty tubing products revenues increased by to million from higher shipment volumes with flat prices 
shipment volumes were up due to additional automotive sales  robust construction activity  and strengthening demand in the overall economy 
steel achieved higher shipments with new capacity from the expansion of its specialty tubing facilities in late flat rolled and other tubular products net revenues were up to million due to higher realized prices with flat shipment volumes 
gross earnings improved to million in from million in the improvement was due to higher shipments of oilfield and specialty tubing products combined with small price increases for oilfield products and flat rolled steel 
increased production volumes also resulted in improved gross margins as raw material costs were essentially unchanged from selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million from million in due to additional selling expenses associated with higher sales and continued modernization of computer systems 
interest income decreased million in from to million primarily due to usage of million of invested funds in january to buy the remaining minority interest in steel 
interest expense of million was million less than due to the conversion of lone star s million subordinated debentures at the end of august into million shares of lone star s common stock 
other income  net 
net other income of million and million for and  respectively  consisted of nonrecurring miscellaneous items 
earnings from continuing operations for improved to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in the improvement was due to higher shipment volumes  small price increases for oilfield products and better gross margins 
extraordinary items totaling million  or 
per diluted share  reflect a million prepayment charge on the refinancing of steel s revolving credit facility and a million gain related to reduction of prior reserves for united mine worker s claims 
gain from discontinued operations of million  or 
per diluted share  resulted from receipt of escrowed proceeds of million from the prior sale of american federal bank 
net earnings of million  or per diluted share  included earnings from continuing operations of million  extraordinary items of million and gain from discontinued operations of million 
financial condition and liquidity at december   lone star had available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities totaling million 
also at year end  steel had a million revolving credit facility  under which it had in borrowings and million in availability after reduction for borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
under this facility  steel could borrow an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the total available borrowing base was million at december  interest was payable under one of two rate options at the london inter bank offer rate libor plus an index which is based on quarterly debt ratio calculations or the institution s prime lending rate plus 
at december   the rate was and was indexed at over libor 
the rate was at december  steel also paid an indexed rate on the unused portion of the credit facility  which was per annum at december  the term of the agreement was through october the loan was secured by steel s assets other than real estate 
as a result of steel s operating environment and resulting losses  the revolving credit agreement was amended in december to provide for the aforementioned borrowing base provisions  adjust the interest rate index and to amend various restrictive financial covenants contained in the agreement 
this million credit facility replaced another million credit facility from other lenders in october in connection with early termination of the million credit facility  a prepayment fee of million was incurred and recognized as an extraordinary loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
on march   steel refinanced its revolving credit facility with a new three year million revolving line of credit and a three year million term loan with a new lender 
the new revolving credit facility is similar to the refinanced facility in that steel can borrow an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
however  the borrowing capacity is increased under the new facility due to higher borrowing base percentages and less restrictive limitations on the inventory portion of the borrowing base 
as of march   the total available borrowing base including the term loan was approximately million 
at steel s option  the interest rate is the prime lending rate plus or the libor plus 
steel also pays a per annum fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of million  plus interest at the prime lending rate plus or the libor plus 
steel s assets other than real estate secure these loans 
the loan agreements contain various restrictive covenants which require steel to meet specified quarterly financial ratios  including cash flow and net worth measurements  which steel anticipates achieving 
steel s ability to incur additional indebtedness is also restricted under the agreements 
steel requires capital primarily to fund general working capital needs and capital expenditures 
principal sources of funds include cash generated by operations  borrowings under steel s revolving credit facility and from lone star 
steel believes that its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will provide the liquidity necessary to fund its cash requirements during steel s operations are subject to restrictive environmental compliance and permitting requirements of various governmental agencies that include the tnrcc and the epa 
steel believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with environmental requirements will fall within its contemplated operating and capital expenditure plans  averaging million annually in the foreseeable future 
lone star has no direct business operations other than steel or significant sources of cash other than from short term investments or the sale of securities 
lone star is reimbursed by steel for most of its operating costs as provided by its cost sharing agreement with steel 
under steel s new revolving credit agreement  lone star s operating costs and steel s portion of lone star s consolidated taxes are the only funds that can be distributed to lone star 
lone star believes that reimbursements by steel for most of its operating costs and funds generated by cash and investments will be adequate to fund its cash requirements during year in order to prepare lone star and steel for the year  a plan has been implemented detailing a process to ensure that its various computer systems are or become year compliant 
this plan encompasses three primary areas business systems both hardware and software  communications equipment  and manufacturing equipment 
the various stages in this process include assessment identifying systems which need change  remediation making changes in the software or hardware  verification testing the changes  and implementation of the year compliant systems 
software applications for the business systems were substantially completed through the verification stage at year end and implementation is scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of the hardware applications related to business systems and the communication equipment have been completed through the verification stage and substantially implemented at the end of  with complete implementation expected by the end of the first quarter approximately half of the manufacturing equipment had been assessed at year end  with no changes required 
the remaining assessment is expected to be completed by april and  although no changes are expected to be necessary  remediation  verification and implementation processes will be developed at that time if needed 
this plan also entails assessing certain year risks related to third party relationships through communications with key suppliers and customers 
the processes described above will be performed on identified third party issues that are correctable 
for those suppliers and customers that may be identified as a concern  such concerns will be addressed in lone star and steel s contingency plan 
lone star and steel have not identified the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios  however  risks identified through the process described above will be analyzed and evaluated 
a contingency plan will be developed in the second quarter of on how those identified risks will be handled 
the cumulative costs incurred through december  to achieve year compliance are approximately million  and are estimated to total million upon completion in forward looking information the statements included in this annual report regarding future financial performance and results and the other statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
the words believes  intends  expects  anticipates  projects  estimates  predicts  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including  but not limited to  industry and market conditions  environmental liabilities  competitive pricing  practices and conditions  availability and pricing of raw materials  fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas  the trade environment  the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations particularly environmental laws and regulations and other factors discussed in this annual report and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lone star and its subsidiaries do not invest in commodities or foreign currencies 
lone star s investments in cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities  the weighted average maturity of which is less than one year  are held to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk is not considered to be material 
information regarding lone star s investments is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements
