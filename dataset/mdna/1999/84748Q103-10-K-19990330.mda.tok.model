sc publishing s strategy is to build its business by offering quality education at value prices 
sc publishing generated net sales of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively  sc publishing mailed approximately million  million and million catalogs 
sc publishing sold its real estate division in june industry and markets wigs based on us census bureau import data  approximately million wigs are sold annually in the united states  which the company estimates to be approximately million in retail sales 
the wig market is comprised of fashion wig wearers and need based wig wearers 
need based wig wearers purchase wigs as a necessity  due to a physical condition such as naturally thinning hair or total hair loss  as well as hair loss due to medical procedures and conditions eg  alopecia and cancer treatments 
many everyday wig wearers replace their wigs every three to four months  and have a wig wardrobe  consisting of several wigs  either of the same style and color or of different styles and colors 
in the s  wigs and hairpieces were broadly viewed as a fashion accessory 
however  as styles and tastes changed  the fashion driven demand for wigs decreased 
due to this trend  during the s and s  the number of specialty wig boutiques declined and department stores reduced their selling space allocated to inventories of wigs 
the company s catalog business was started to serve the need based wig customers who were not being adequately serviced by other retail alternatives 
the company believes that only approximately million women  or  of the estimated million american women with thinning hair  currently wear wigs  and that  accordingly  there is substantial opportunity for future growth of the company s business 
the caucasian retail wig market  which the company estimates to be an approximately million market with approximately million units sold annually  is serviced by direct mail catalogers and retail outlets  including beauty salons  wig shops and department stores 
the company estimates that catalog sales represent of the units sold and of the sales dollars annually in the caucasian market and believes that catalogs offer the benefits of privacy  convenience  lower prices and broader product selection 
retail stores provide customers with more personalized service and allow customers to try on the product  however  they generally charge higher prices and offer less convenience  privacy and selection than catalog retailers 
the african american wig market  unlike the caucasian market  has yet to undergo any significant transition to direct marketing from retail outlets 
although african american women comprise approximately of the us female population  they purchase approximately of the wig units sold annually 
the company estimates that annual sales to the african american wig market are approximately million and million units 
only about of african american wigs are sold through catalogs  with the balance sold primarily in beauty salons and wig shops 
the company believes that its especially yours r catalog  which targets african american women  already has the highest sales volume of any catalog offering wigs designed for african american women 
the company estimates that the international wig and hairpiece market is at least as large as the us market 
by identifying opportunities through acquisitions and licensing programs  the company has the ability to facilitate international expansion 
the company currently has license agreements to sell its products in germany  austria and the uk 
women s apparel and hats women s apparel is a multi billion dollar market 
in  the company began to position paula s hatbox r to appeal to the middle aged woman who wants fashionable  coordinated merchandise at affordable prices 
to attract as much of this segment as possible  many of the fashion items are offered in misses  as well as regular sizing 
the merchandise selection in the especially yours r catalog was also expanded to include a greater selection of women s apparel and hats than were previously offered 
the company believes that the fashion hat market  like the wig market  has not been well serviced by existing retail channels of distribution  with no major retailer offering a broad selection of quality hats 
the women s fashion hat market is fragmented among department stores  small boutiques  resort stores and other general merchants and catalog retailers who offer a limited number of styles as a complement to their principal product lines 
although the women s fashion hat market is estimated to be in excess of a million market  no dominant hat retailer has emerged 
continuing education nursing  accounting and other industries require their professionals to meet continuing education ce requirements on an ongoing basis 
required ce frequency and the number of required hours vary from profession to profession and from state to state depending on state laws and association regulations 
the ce industry has many small providers  including local universities  but few large providers 
in addition  some hospitals and accounting firms educate their own employees through in house programs and by subsidizing outside programs 
because ce is a required product  people may not be enthusiastic buyers 
accordingly  sc publishing competes aggressively on price  course content and selection  and customer service 
nursing ce represented approximately of sc publishing s ce sales in approximately of the states in the us currently require nurses to have some form of ce 
sc publishing is exploring the expansion of its share of this market by experimenting with new formats  such as newsletters and crossfolds  that are more cost effective to produce than the current catalogs or may create additional revenue opportunities 
sc publishing also sells ce to cpas  who generally are required to obtain minimum levels of ce every year 
sc publishing seeks to compete in this market by offering current ce topics in a convenient manner at competitive prices 
approximately of sc publishing s net sales were represented by the accounting market 
sc publishing develops its products by first identifying topics pertinent to its target audiences of nurses and cpas 
for the nursing market  sc publishing then contracts with qualified authors to develop course textbooks and exam materials 
due to the fact that regulations rapidly change in the accounting market and the economics of writing courses  sc publishing buys existing textbooks and contracts with authors or industry experts to create introductory materials and exams that enhance and test the learning of the materials presented in the textbooks 
all courses and exams are subject to peer review by industry experts before publishing 
products wigs hairpieces the company sells a wide range of wigs and hairpieces in the united states  canada  united kingdom and through its international licensing agreements 
the company offers over different wig styles and different hairpieces in more than colors  including browns  blondes  grays and reds 
most wigs are available in one or two sizes  except for wigs in the christine jordan r brand  most of which are offered in five sizes 
wigs provide full coverage  and are lighter in weight and more natural looking compared to wigs from the s 
hairpieces include wiglets  add ons and extensions 
wiglets are small wigs generally worn on the top of the head to add style or cover thinning hair on the top or crown area 
add ons or extensions are usually added for style reasons  generally to the back of the head 
virtually all of the wigs sold by the company are made from a special synthetic fiber  the market for which is dominated by two japanese firms  kaneka corporation and toyo chemical corporation 
this synthetic fiber is not a proprietary material  and other manufacturers in the past have produced this material 
should there be a permanent or long term disruption in the supply of fiber  the company believes that the time required to obtain an alternate source and the attendant delay in new production  as well as a possible significant increase in the price of fiber  may have a material adverse effect on the company s wig and hairpiece sales and profit margins 
in early  the company introduced human hair and human hair blend wigs to its line of products 
human hair wigs have versatile styling that allows customers to wear their wigs any way they prefer 
the human hair blends allow the customer to enjoy the shape retaining endurance and ease of care of our synthetic style wigs with the versatile look and feel of our human hair styles 
the company expects that most of its wigs and hairpieces  including its new human hair and human hair blend wigs  will continue to be manufactured in asia in the future 
accordingly  the company s operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad  including fluctuations in the value of currencies  such as the recent financial instabilities in the asian markets  export duties  work stoppages and  in certain parts of the world  political instability and possible governmental intervention 
as such  the availability and cost of wigs may be favorably or adversely affected by any of these items 
although to date such risks have not had a significant effect on the company s business operations  no assurance can be given that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business operations in the future 
during  the company purchased approximately of its wigs and hairpieces directly from eight foreign manufacturers and the balance from one us importer 
each of the company s five largest manufacturers represented between and of its overall wig purchases in the company maintains close relationships with many of the leading wig manufacturers 
through these relationships  the company is able to obtain better control over purchasing  styles  quality and cost 
apparel and hats the company offers a variety of fashion apparel in both its paula s hatbox r and especially yours r catalogs 
the merchandise in the paula s hatbox r catalog includes both dressy as well as casual items and includes a variety of hats that are specifically offered because of the coordinated look they allow a woman to put together 
the paula s hatbox r catalog also offers a selection of shoes and handbags 
the especially yours r catalog offers a selection of apparel and hats targeted to african american women 
the majority of the company s hats are manufactured domestically and purchased from domestic vendors  including top designers 
the company s apparel is purchased from designers  who may produce or contract to produce the merchandise overseas or domestically 
with the exception of a few items  all merchandise is replaced at the beginning of each season ie  spring and fall to offer seasonally appropriate products with additional offerings added throughout each season to maintain the freshness of the products offered in and the appearance of the catalog 
marketing the company markets its wigs  apparel  hats  fashion accessories and continuing education courses primarily through catalogs 
also  in  the company began to sell its products via the internet  which is discussed further in the new opportunities section below 
wig customers are obtained predominantly by way of a two step marketing program 
step one involves obtaining prospective customers by soliciting customer interest through targeted advertising 
the company uses a variety of advertising media  including magazines  newspapers  tabloids  co op mailers  package insert programs and television 
the company places advertising based on demographics  cost and historical experience 
historical experience is measured by cost per inquiry  cost per customer and lifetime value of a customer 
based on this information  the company determines which media are effective and where future marketing dollars should be spent 
step two  which commences when a prospective customer responds favorably to an advertisement placed by the company  involves sending the prospective customer a series of catalogs designed to elicit an initial sale 
by pre qualifying prospects in this manner  the company has been able to convert up to approximately of its paula young r inquirers and up to approximately of its especially yours r inquirers into customers within one year of their catalog requests 
if a sale is made  the customer is put on an active list and additional catalogs designed to create a repeat buyer are mailed 
inactive inquirers and customers are periodically sent a program of targeted mailings designed to reactivate them 
the company believes that it differentiates itself from both traditional storefront retailers and other direct marketers by offering a broad and deep selection of the core wig products it offers 
also  by virtue of its large order volume and direct purchasing from wig manufacturers  the company is able to offer wigs and hairpieces at prices significantly lower than most hair salons and wig shops 
beginning in  customers for the paula s hatbox r catalog were obtained using the more traditional one step approach 
in a one step approach  names are rented from another catalog company or outside list providers based on certain criteria  such as buying habits and nature of the products purchased 
the company markets its ce courses using a one step marketing program targeted directly at nursing and accounting professionals whose licenses will expire if they do not obtain further continuing education credits 
the company has also begun to put a selection of its courses and catalog titles on the internet 
the first courses became available on the internet in january the company continually refines its marketing programs and processes for the purpose of increasing its conversion rate and the rate of repeat purchases 
the company employs a variety of research methods  including demographic analysis  database modeling  customer surveys  test mailings and advertising  focus groups and outside research sources 
the company s research efforts have assisted the company in pursuing its strategic goals by identifying new niche markets  such as the market for its products among african american women 
new opportunities the company intends to continue to build its business in its existing markets as well as to enter new markets  both by internal expansion and through acquisitions 
in executing its plans  the company will pursue the following e commerce in early  the company redesigned its internet web sites www 
paulayoung 
com and www 
especiallyyours 
com to provide information on the latest selection of wigs and hairpieces  and also added secure  on line ordering capabilities 
these web sites also include links to a sister web site  www 
paulashatbox 
com  which will be available later in these sites provide information on products and styling  and answers to frequently asked questions 
the wig sites will provide links to additional sites of interest to wig customers  such as sites that deal with alopecia  cancer  religion and alternative lifestyles 
in march  the company purchased the domain name www 
wig 
com and has reserved other generic domain internet sites in order to increase the amount of online traffic to the company web sites 
also  the company will continue to look for other internet related opportunities  such as the use of search engines to promote the company s businesses 
acquisitions the company intends to be aggressive with respect to its acquisition strategy in wigs and hairpieces  which is focused on building market share through further consolidation of the wig and hairpiece market  both in the united states and internationally 
the company will also continue to explore acquisition candidates  aside from wig and hairpiece companies  such as those offering products targeted to senior women or those offering products complementary to wigs and hairpieces 
licensing agreements the company believes there are opportunities to expand into other countries through licensing agreements 
the company s standard license agreement  in general  grants each licensee an exclusive right to use the company s trademarks to sell wigs in the licensee s territory 
under the terms of the license agreement  the company supplies the licensee the inventory for which the company is paid its cost for the inventory plus an administrative fee for its shipping and handling costs 
the company also provides marketing advice and catalog development assistance 
in general  the licensees are required to pay royalties on their net sales and expend a specified minimum amount of advertising each year 
the company currently has active license agreements in the uk  germany and austria 
business to business the company has been testing business to business opportunities in the united states during the last few years 
since a certain percentage of women will prefer shopping for wigs in retail outlets  the company  through a business to business catalog  seeks to distribute its products to existing retail channels  such as wig shops and beauty salons 
the company already sells wigs and hairpieces via the business to business concept in the uk through daxbourne 
during  the company entered into an agreement with cyberimaging systems  inc to offer the company s products to salons and other retailers through a computer based hairstyle imaging system  incorporating the company s wig and hairpiece products and brand names 
the company regularly monitors other technological advances to determine if any may have applicability to its businesses 
new products the company seeks to leverage its customer relationships by adding new product lines to its catalogs 
by developing and offering new products which customers desire  the company creates additional sales opportunities and reinforces customer loyalty to the company s catalogs 
for example  fashion apparel began to be offered in the paula s hatbox r catalog in  human hair and human hair blend wigs were introduced in the company s wig catalogs in january  the star jones tm line of wigs and hairpieces was introduced in the first mailing of the especially yours r catalog in january  and the raquel welch tm line of wigs was introduced in the paula young r catalog in march databases the company has developed proprietary databases for its wig  apparel  hat  african american and continuing education businesses consisting of customers and inquirers 
the company markets mailing lists derived from its databases to non competing businesses to provide additional sources of income  after confirming that security measures are in place to protect this proprietary data 
the company has undertaken limited exchanges of lists of inactive customers with wig competitors 
due to the fact that wig wearers are difficult to find  the company believes that its wig database is unique and would be very expensive to replicate and  as such  poses a substantial barrier to entry for any potential competitor in the wig industry 
operations order entry and customer service the company has structured its telemarketing operation and the training for its telemarketing representatives to simplify catalog shopping by emphasizing prompt  courteous and knowledgeable service 
customers may call toll free telephone numbers hours a day  seven days a week  to place orders or to request a catalog 
approximately of the company s orders are placed by telephone  with calls lasting three to four minutes 
the balance of orders is received by mail 
the company has contracted with an outside telemarketing provider to handle calls in the event call volume exceeds the company s capacity during peak business hours  as well as to answer the company s phones during off peak hours 
overflow situations also occur due to holidays and operational disruptions  such as poor weather 
telemarketing representatives process orders directly into the company s computer system  which provides customer history  product availability  product specifications  expected ship date and order number 
the telemarketing representatives use a scripted catalog sales system  are knowledgeable in key product specifications and features  and are trained to cross sell accessories and related products 
in keeping with the company s efforts to maximize operating efficiency  representatives are trained to handle a range of products and customer service calls  allowing the company to shift representatives among catalogs as call volume requires 
by emphasizing the training of telemarketing representatives  the company seeks to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction 
the company seeks to provide prompt  courteous and knowledgeable service to its customers in order to build customer loyalty and demonstrate to the customer the convenience and reliability of catalog shopping 
in november  the company renegotiated its contract for long distance service with at t for three years at rates approximately lower than rates under the previous contract 
the company uses lucent technology equipment with a line capacity and presently uses about lines in stations 
the company s telephone system permits flexibility in routing calls to maximize tele service representative efficiency 
fulfillment the company s fulfillment goal is the prompt delivery of ordered merchandise 
orders received are usually shipped by the next day  primarily via third class or priority mail 
for an additional charge  the company will ship by overnight or second day courier 
merchandise not in stock on the date of order  is shipped within hours of its receipt by the company 
the company uses an integrated computer picking  packing and shipping system 
the system monitors the in stock status of each item ordered  processes the order and generates all related packing and shipping materials  taking into account the location of items within the distribution center 
during fiscal  the company shipped an average of approximately  packages per business day 
returns the company s return policy allows customers to return products for prompt refund or exchange 
the company believes that its return levels are normal for mail order products of this nature 
return experience is closely monitored at the individual product level to identify trends in product offerings  product defects and quality issues in an attempt to assess future purchases  enhance customer satisfaction and reduce overall returns 
inventory management the company s inventory management goal is to balance a high initial fulfillment rate with reasonable levels of inventory investment and low overstocks 
to achieve this goal  the company seeks to schedule merchandise deliveries and inventory amounts to conform closely to sales levels 
initial orders for wigs  apparel and hats are placed two to four months before a catalog mailing 
initial deliveries are scheduled to occur one or two weeks before the first mailing 
initial purchase quantities are based on a variety of factors  including past experience with the same or similar products  future availability  shipping time  and  with respect to apparel  hat and accessory vendors  the company s ability to negotiate a reorder commitment from the vendor 
the company continuously analyzes sales and returns for each item in a catalog 
using this information  the company projects gross demand and returns for such items and  based on these projections and inventory on hand and on order  makes decisions regarding additional purchases 
the company sells overstocks and discontinued items through targeted mailings and sale pages bound into its full price catalogs 
catalog production the company s catalogs are designed in house by the company s graphic arts staff of designers and production artists using a computer desktop publishing system 
the company s in house design of catalogs provides the company with greater control  flexibility and creativity in catalog production and product selection  and results in significant cost savings 
for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively  sc direct mailed approximately million  million and million catalogs 
for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively  sc publishing mailed approximately million  million and million catalogs 
competition the mail order catalog business is highly competitive 
the company believes that it competes on the basis of quality  value  service  product offerings  advertising effectiveness  catalog design  convenience and efficiency 
the company s wig  apparel and hat catalogs compete with other mail order catalogs  both specialty and general  retail stores  including hair salons and wig shops  department stores  specialty stores and discount stores and internet web sites 
the company believes it has advantages over its two principal mail order wig competitors  general wig company  which markets wigs through the beauty trends catalog  and vincent james company  which markets wigs through the twc catalog 
the company believes that these advantages include economies of scale  the size of its customer list  and its extensive advertising programs 
the company s ce catalogs compete with other mail order catalogs  in house ce  professional associations  and seminar providers 
the ce industry has many small providers  including local universities  but few large providers 
potential competition may emerge from new distribution channels such as the internet and interactive television 
accordingly  sc publishing competes aggressively on price  course content and selection and customer service 
sc publishing also plans to compete on the internet 
employees as of january   sc direct and sc publishing combined employed a total of employees  consisting of salaried full time employees  salaried part time employees  full time hourly employees  and part time hourly employees

trademarks  patents and trade names the company has trademarks registered in the united states  two registered trademarks in the united kingdom  three trademark applications and one patent with the us patent and trademark office 
the company also has four trademarks registered under california state law 
in the course of normal business  the company often utilizes new trade names 
when appropriate  the company seeks to register these names 
government regulations in  the united states supreme court reaffirmed an earlier decision that allowed direct marketers to make sales into states where they do not have a physical presence without collecting sales taxes  but noted that congress has the power to change this law 
the imposition of an obligation to collect sales taxes may have a negative effect on the company s response rates and may require the company to incur administrative costs in collecting and remitting sales taxes 
the company believes that massachusetts is the only jurisdiction where it is currently required to collect sales taxes

the company is in the process of installing a new catalog information system purchased from an outside vendor 
the system is currently undergoing modification by the company s internal staff 
the system is scheduled to be implemented for sc direct  a subsidiary of the company  in mid following the implementation by sc direct  it is anticipated that the system will be modified to deal with the special processing needs of sc publishing  another subsidiary of the company 
it is anticipated that these modifications will take between three and six months to complete  with full implementation being completed by the end of the entire cost of the new system  including new hardware and internal payroll and payroll related costs  is estimated to be million 
as of january   million of these costs have been capitalized  of which approximately  was added during the year ended january  during march  the company completed the renovation of its former warehouse space in its south easton facility to allow for further office expansion

the company s cash flow from operations and available credit facilities are considered adequate to fund planned business operations and both the short term and long term capital needs of the company 
however  certain events  such as additional significant acquisitions  could require new external financing 
year readiness the company s current information and computer systems will be affected by the year yk issue  which refers to the inability of computerized systems to process dates beyond december  the company is formulating a yk plan to address the company s yk issues 
based on its current assessments from the yk plan  the company does not expect at present that it will experience a disruption of its operations as a result of the change to the new millennium 
the company is in the process of installing a new comprehensive catalog information system purchased from an outside vendor  who has represented that the software addresses the yk issue 
if the company s new computer system fails with respect to the yk issue  there could be a material adverse impact on the business operations or financial performance of the company  including its ability to take customer orders  ship products  invoice customers and collect payments 
it is anticipated that the installation will be completed in mid the company estimates that the entire cost of the new system  including new hardware and internal payroll and payroll related costs  will be million 
as of january   million of these costs have been capitalized  of which approximately  was added during the year ended january  if the new catalog information system cannot be effectively installed  then the company has scheduled the current computer vendor to provide a free upgrade in june that will make the current computer operating system yk ready 
also  in january  the company successfully converted its financial and accounting systems to a new software package that has been represented by the vendor to be yk ready 
the foregoing timetable and assessment of costs to become yk compliant reflect management s current best estimates 
these estimates are based on many assumptions  including assumptions about the cost  availability and ability of resources to locate  remediate and modify affected systems  equipment and facilities 
based upon its activities to date  the company does not currently believe that these factors will cause results to differ significantly from those estimated 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial condition and operations if key third parties including  among others  suppliers  contractors  financial institutions  non retail customers and governments do not become yk compliant on a timely basis 
the company is assessing the state of readiness of its major suppliers and customers through written inquiry and evaluation of responses 
the company intends to follow up with those suppliers or customers that indicate material problems 
alternate suppliers or service providers will be identified for those whose responses indicate an unusually high risk of a yk problem 
the company s evaluation of business processes that are not related to information systems  and the development of contingency plans where such evaluation identifies a high risk of a yk problem should be completed by the third quarter of the main risks associated with the yk problem are the uncertainties as to whether the company s suppliers can continue to perform their services for the company uninterrupted by the yk event  and whether the company s non retail customers can continue to operate their business uninterrupted by the yk event 
the company s suppliers  if they are unable to remediate their yk problems  may be unable to produce or deliver goods ordered by the company 
the company depends significantly upon telephone orders  should the company s telephone service be adversely affected  the company will be unable to receive a high percentage of its retail orders 
the company also depends in large measure on delivery services such as the united states post office  federal express and ups to deliver goods to retail customers  accordingly should one or more of these delivery services prove unable to make deliveries as a result of yk problems  the company s cash flow and business would be severely and adversely affected 
although the state of readiness of the company s suppliers  delivery services and non retail customers will be monitored and evaluated  and contingency plans will be developed  no assurances can be given as to the eventual state of readiness of the company s suppliers and or customers 
nor can any assurances be given as to eventual effectiveness of the company s contingency plans 
the preceding discussion contains forward looking information within the meaning of section e of the exchange act 
this disclosure is also subject to protection under the year information and readiness disclosure act of  public law  as a year statement and year readiness disclosure as defined therein 
actual results may differ materially from such projected information due to changes in the underlying assumptions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
required that a company a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
comprehensive income consisted solely of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments in connection with the company s united kingdom subsidiary in during the year ended january   the company has recognized other comprehensive income of  the company has also adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information in the fourth quarter of sfas no 
established standards for the way public companies report selected information about operating segments in annual financial statements and required those companies to report selected information about segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also established standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
required disclosures have been made in the footnotes to the financial statements 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop required that costs incurred in the development of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over a period of time 
the company adopted sop in the first quarter of during the year ended january   the company has capitalized approximately  of costs associated with a new comprehensive catalog information system  of which approximately  were internal payroll and payroll related costs 
in april  the company adopted sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop required costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
sop had no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations for the year ended january  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet determined the effect  if any  of adopting sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors postal rates  paper prices and media costs 
postage  shipping and paper costs are significant expenses in the operation of the company s business 
the company mails its catalogs and generally ships its products to customers through the us postal service and  at the customer s request and expense  ships its products by overnight and second day delivery services 
the company passes on the costs of mailing its products directly to customers as separate shipping and handling charges  but does not directly pass on paper costs and the costs of mailing its catalogs 
any future increases in postal or shipping rates or paper costs will have an adverse effect on the company s operating results if the company is unable to pass on these increases to its customers 
in addition  a rise in media costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to generate new customers 
limited sources of fiber 
the majority of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of wigs 
virtually all of the wigs sold by the company are made from special synthetic fiber manufactured by only two japanese companies  kaneka corporation and toyo chemical corporation 
the wig manufacturers from whom the company purchases its inventory purchase the fiber from these two fiber manufacturers 
should there be a permanent or long term disruption in the supply of fiber  the company believes that the time required to obtain an alternate source and the attendant delay in new production  as well as a possible significant increase in the price of fiber  may have a material adverse effect on the company s wig and hairpiece sales and profit margins 
limited number of wig manufacturers 
the wigs sold by the company are produced by a limited number of manufacturers 
each of the company s five largest manufacturers supplied between and of the company s overall wig purchases in the loss of one or more of these manufacturers could materially disrupt the company s wig operations 
although the company believes that in such an event it could purchase its wig requirements from the remaining manufacturers and from additional manufacturers  there can be no assurance that such sources of supply could meet the company s wig requirements without considerable disruption to the company s purchasing cycles  inventory levels and profit margins 
the company does not currently have  and does not anticipate entering into in the foreseeable future  long term supply contracts with its manufacturers 
dependence upon foreign suppliers  exchange rates  and currency fluctuations 
the company expects that most of its wigs and hairpieces will continue to be manufactured in asia in the future 
accordingly  the company s operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad  including fluctuations in the value of currencies  such as the recent financial instabilities in the asian markets  export duties  work stoppages and  in certain parts of the world  political instability and possible governmental intervention 
as such  the availability and cost of wigs may be favorably or adversely affected by any of these items 
although to date such risks have not had a significant effect on the company s business operations  no assurance can be given that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business operations in the future 
risk of a cure for hair loss  cancer treatment improvement 
millions of american women suffer varying degrees of hair loss  including those suffering hair loss as a side effect of cancer treatments 
women suffering from hair loss comprise a substantial percentage of the company s customer base for its wigs and hairpieces 
ongoing research is conducted by numerous groups  both public and private  seeking remedies for hair loss 
one drug  minoxidil marketed under the name rogaine r as well as other names  is now available over the counter and is sold to men and women as a measure against hair loss 
there can be no assurance that another new drug will not be developed that could prevent hair loss among women 
such an event may have a material adverse effect on the company s core wig business 
in addition  the development of any therapies  such as new cancer treatments  that would eliminate hair loss as a side effect  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposures to market risks include fluctuations in interest rates on its short term and long term debt of approximately million as of january  and in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its short term borrowings under its credit facilities 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
management does not believe that the risk inherent in the variable rate nature of these instruments will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  no assurance can be given that such a risk will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements in the future 
the company s term loan and line of credit bear interest rates based on either a base rate or a libor contract rate 
the company s uk term loan and the uk line of credit bear interest rates based on either a sterling base rate or a libor contract rate 
see liquidity and capital resources 
as of january   the term loan was under a libor contract rate of for million and for  as of january   million of the line of credit was under libor contract rates ranging from to and the remainder of the line of credit was at the base rate of 
as of january   a portion of both the uk term loan and uk line of credit were under a libor contract rate of 
as of january   the outstanding balance on all of the company s credit facilities was  based on this balance  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
the company s objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the british pound  chinese yuan and indonesian rupiah 
the company expects that most of its wigs and hairpieces will continue to be manufactured in china and indonesia in the future 
accordingly  the company s operations are subject to fluctuations in the value of these countries currencies 
although to date such exchange rate exposures have not had a significant effect on the company s business operations  no assurance can be given that such exchange rate exposures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business operations in the future 
also  the implementation of the euro currency in is not expected to materially affect the company s operations  or its risk profile 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
