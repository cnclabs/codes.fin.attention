item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the factors set forth under the caption forward looking information below 
overview we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of non powered lawn and garden tools 
we are a holding company with no business operations of its own 
our only material asset is all of the outstanding capital stock of uniontools 
founded in  we completed an initial public offering in we used a portion of the proceeds of such offering to repay debt associated with a leveraged buyout 
since  we have implemented a business strategy designed to transform us from a manufacturing oriented industrial company into a marketing oriented consumer products company 
the central elements of our approach include a market segmentation strategy based primarily on brand management and a merchandising strategy based on attractive and informative product displays and labeling 
the price of raw materials used in our products remained relatively stable during each of the periods discussed below 
implementation of our market segmentation and merchandising strategies has resulted in increased selling  general and administrative expenses as we have increased our marketing focus through the development of merchandising displays  point of sale signage and product labeling  as well as additional cooperative advertising 
we also incurred an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due to increased staffing and upgrades of management information systems 
an increase in competitive pressures could result in additional increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as increases in volume rebates and other discounts and allowances that reduce net sales and adversely effect profitability 
during the latter part of fiscal  we experienced difficulties in manufacturing and logistical control that resulted in a significant deterioration in customer service 
product shortages resulting from the consolidation of our columbus  ohio manufacturing facility into our primary manufacturing facility located in frankfort  new york contributed to the problems encountered 
additional problems arose in connection with a computer upgrade required for our computer systems to meet year compliance  followed by the loss of the distribution center manager in charge of our primary distribution center located in columbus  ohio in the third quarter of fiscal difficulties were further compounded by the absence of formal processes and procedures at the distribution center  and by the complexity added to our operations by our decision to distribute watering products from columbus without an adequate increment in resources 
we were not fully aware of the ramifications and financial consequences of these issues  particularly the customer deductions  freight costs and inventory loss discovered upon taking a physical inventory count  until the fourth quarter of fiscal at year end  we made significant adjustments to properly reflect appropriate value in accounts receivable  inventories  product tooling and accrued liabilities 
control issues contributed to an inventory loss discovered upon taking physical inventory 
worker s compensation reserves were reviewed for all plan years as a result of an estimated settlement of certain open years with our insurance carrier and adjusted to proper levels 
we wrote off product tooling and obsolete inventory related to a discontinued product offering 
excess and obsolete inventory was evaluated and reserves were provided to reflect anticipated value recovery below cost 
accounts receivable in bankruptcy and other aged accounts were reserved 
the effect of these adjustments  combined with the deterioration in financial performance due to problems in manufacturing and logistical control  resulted in our reporting a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  million for the full year of fiscal we have taken several actions aimed at preventing a recurrence of these matters 
the distribution center has been staffed with a professional facility manager  and we have implemented upgrades in or new positions of warehouse manager  traffic manager and inventory control manager 
we have also increased our capacity by leasing a larger facility in chino  california and have leased a warehouse in frankfort  new york  enabling us to ship directly from the primary manufacturing facility  when preferable 
outgoing shipment audits have also been initiated 
we expect customer service level performance and related customer deductions to return to historical levels by the end of december there have been several key changes in senior management to strengthen and focus the company 
a new president and chief executive was promoted internally in september to lead the company  following the resignation of his predecessor 
similarly  the senior vice president of operations resigned in september and was replaced by an executive of the company 
the chief financial officer resigned in june and the director of marketing resigned in september a new chief financial officer was hired in june and vice presidents of marketing and sales were hired in september and november  respectively 
a director of human resources was hired in november we believe that these changes will provide the leadership and experience necessary to restore and enhance profitability 
the magnitude of the losses  combined with the costs to execute a manufacturing consolidation and a share repurchase program  required us to address our liquidity needs after year end 
as a result  we have entered into a sixth amendment to the company s credit facility  including a million capital infusion by our majority stockholder  discussed further in liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain components of our consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended august  july  july  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense amortization of intangibles other expenses  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income loss from continuing operations gain loss from discontinued operations net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
our net sales increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal reflected an aggregate million of net sales arising from a full year of offering watering products  partially offset by operational inefficiencies in our core business 
gross profit 
fiscal gross profit declined million to million compared to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in gross profit was driven primarily by several factors 
logistical and manufacturing control issues during negatively affected customer service levels and drove higher customer deductions  distribution and freight costs associated with the revenue for that period 
control issues also contributed to an inventory loss that was discovered by taking a physical inventory count 
at year end  worker s compensation reserves were reviewed for all plan years as a result of an estimated settlement of certain open years with our insurance carrier and adjusted to proper levels 
we wrote off product tooling and obsolete inventory related to a discontinued product offering 
excess and obsolete inventory was evaluated and reserves were provided to reflect anticipated value recovery below cost 
accounts receivable in bankruptcy and other aged accounts were reserved 
the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by benefits from our cost reduction program 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to having a full year of costs related to the watering products business 
senior management restructuring charges  including severance  recruiting and relocation costs  and the write off of uncollectible accounts contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
other expenses  net 
other expenses increased million to approximately million in fiscal from 
million in fiscal approximately million of the increase related to plant consolidation costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of our columbus  ohio manufacturing facility into our primary facility located in frankfort  new york  and consolidation of the manufacturing operations of our watering products 
we also incurred approximately million in fiscal related to accounting  legal  consulting and other expenses related to the exploration of strategic transactions 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million in fiscal  an million decline from a profit of million in fiscal interest expense increased 
million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net loss 
we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal  a million deterioration compared to a profit of million in fiscal the loss from discontinued operations of 
million primarily reflects a worker s compensation accrual adjustment of 
million for businesses previously sold 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
our net sales increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net sales reflected an aggregate of million of additional net sales arising from a full year of operation of our injection molding division  from sales by our watering products division and from sales of new products  partially offset by a decline in net sales of long handle tools and snow tools of approximately million 
net sales of long handle tools in the second and third quarters were negatively impacted by unfavorable winter and spring weather conditions 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower net sales of long handle tools and lower overhead absorption rates realized as we decreased production in response to sluggish demand  as well as competitive pricing pressures 
gross margin also was adversely affected by increased manufacturing costs related to new product development and lower gross margins realized by our injection molding division 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by increased administrative expenses resulting from public company requirements and pursuit of our acquisition strategy 
other expenses  net 
other expenses decreased million to approximately  in fiscal from million in fiscal other expenses in fiscal included the write off of  of capitalized bank fees incurred in connection with our previous bank credit facility 
income from continuing operations before income taxes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in fiscal from a loss of approximately  in fiscal interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense was partially reduced by the retirement in july of approximately million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness in connection with our initial public offering 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from a loss of million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a loss of million in fiscal from discontinued operations 
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  impact of weather the lawn and garden industry is seasonal in nature  with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in january through may 
accordingly  our sales tend to be greater during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
as a result  our operating results depend significantly on the spring selling season 
to support this sales peak  we must anticipate demand and build inventories of finished goods throughout the fall and winter 
accordingly  our levels of raw materials and finished goods inventories tend to be at their highest  relative to sales  during our first and second fiscal quarters 
these factors increase variations in our quarterly results of operations and potentially expose us to greater adverse effects of changes in economic and industry trends 
moreover  actual demand for our products may vary substantially from the anticipated demand  leaving us with excess inventory or insufficient inventory to satisfy customer orders 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited data of the company for each of the quarters in fiscal and fiscal the financial data for each of these quarters is unaudited but includes all adjustments which the company believes to be necessary for a fair presentation 
all quarters include normal recurring adjustments except for the fourth quarter of which includes certain adjustments of million related to the write off of obsolete inventory  write off of tooling associated with a discontinued product  increases in the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  and increases in the reserve for worker s compensation and other miscellaneous adjustments 
these operating results  however are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal quarter ended october january may  july  october january april  july  in thousands unaudited net sales         cost of goods sold         gross profit         selling  general and administrative expenses sg a         gross profit less sg a     net sales as a percentage of full year net sales gross profit as a percentage of full year gross profit gross profit less sg a as a percentage of full year operating profit loss does not include amortization of intangibles and other expenses  each of which generally are non seasonal in nature 
fourth quarter gross margin less sg a would have been a million loss if you exclude the million effect of the unusual year end charges described above 
weather is the single most important factor in determining market demand for our products and also is the least predictable 
for example  while floods in the midwest adversely affected the sale of most types of lawn and garden equipment in  the severe winter of resulted in a surge in demand for snow shovels 
in addition  bad weather during the spring gardening season  such as that experienced throughout most of the us in the spring of and  can adversely affect overall annual sales 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
we have financed our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under the company s senior credit facility the credit facility 
net cash provided by continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in operations of million in fiscal the improvement in use of cash was due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in liabilities 
accounts receivable declined as a result of lower fourth quarter net sales levels and improved collection efforts at year end 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased due to adjustments in worker s compensation and employee medical accruals at year end  as well as accrued severance and other expenses related to the manufacturing consolidation 
costs were also accrued related to the restructuring of senior management as discussed in the overview 
the payables outstanding were higher than prior year due to greater manufacturing activity near year end and more effective cash management 
depreciation and amortization increased million in fiscal  to million compared to million in fiscal this is primarily due to a million charge to fully depreciate tooling related to a discontinued product line 
these items were partially offset by the deterioration in net income  to a net loss of million 
net cash used in continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in continuing operations of million in fiscal the decrease in use of cash was principally the result of net income of million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased sales volume 
we made capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the capital expenditures relate primarily to ongoing improvements of property  plant and equipment  manufacturing process improvements and increased manufacturing capacity 
in fiscal  capital was also spent on the consolidation of the columbus  ohio manufacturing facility into the primary facility in frankfort  new york 
we intend to make capital expenditures of approximately million in the next twelve months primarily related to the purchase of new equipment and equipment and facility maintenance 
in july  we used approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to redeem preferred stock and approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay a portion of our subordinated debt 
the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated debt associated with a leveraged buyout was exchanged for  shares of common stock 
we entered into the credit facility to finance capital expenditures  including future acquisitions  and to fund working capital and other general business purposes 
in july  we used approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the credit facility and accrued interest thereon 
as of july   approximately million was available under the revolving portion of the credit facility and approximately million was available under the acquisition line of the credit facility 
indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility bears interest at variable rates per annum at july  
we recognized that the net losses and share repurchase that occurred in fiscal  as well as the costs required to improve the profitability of the business including the senior management restructuring and complete the manufacturing consolidation in the near term  would require more liquidity than was available to us at year end 
as a result of the fourth quarter of fiscal operating performance  we were not in compliance with our credit facility covenants 
therefore  on october  we entered into an amendment of the credit facility to support operational  capital expenditure and working capital needs through april   the revised term of the facility 
first  all covenant defaults were waived and new covenants were set to reflect the current profitability of the business 
the interest rate with respect to the credit facility was reset to libor plus  up from libor plus 
the revolving portion of the facility increased to million  then million during peak working capital months  reducing back down to million in conjunction with anticipated working capital levels 
a success fee in favor of the lenders was added  the amount of which fluctuates according to the date of satisfaction of our obligations under the credit facility  with a maximum fee on the outstanding facility commitment toward the end of the eighteen month term 
the acquisition line was fixed at its current balance of approximately million 
stock repurchases are now prohibited  though we did repurchase approximately million of common stock during fiscal our majority stockholder infused million of capital  in the form of junior  participating debt in the credit facility 
this debt is evidenced by a subordinated note which carries a paid in kind interest option and is exchangeable for shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we are in the process of evaluating all non strategic assets for purposes of sale  including the anticipated sale of the columbus manufacturing facility in november we are working to reduce the days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  including the offer of discount terms where appropriate 
the action steps we have taken to resolve the logistical and manufacturing control issues that negatively impacted the fourth quarter of fiscal should serve to reduce customer deductions  distribution and freight costs 
capital and other expenditures are being scrutinized and potentially deferred if not considered critical 
it is our belief that these actions  together with the revised facility commitment and the capital infusion by our majority stockholder  will provide sufficient liquidity for the business to operate over the term of the facility 
effects of inflation we are adversely affected by inflation primarily through the purchase of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses and higher interest rates 
we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have not been material in recent years 
impact of the year on computer systems state of readiness 
we have reviewed our year issues in regards to both our information technology and its non information technology 
our operating system software as well as some of our older software applications were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those software applications have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
we have modified or replaced portions of our software applications and hardware so that our computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
we believe that our information technology is year ready 
we do not believe that there are any material year issues with regard to non information technology eg machinery used in manufacturing  forklifts  general office equipment  and other equipment that may contain embedded chips or date sensitive processors 
in addition  we have initiated communications with our significant customers and suppliers to determine the extent to which our interface systems are vulnerable to the failure of such customers and suppliers to remediate their own year issues 
based on such communications  we are not currently aware of any third party issue applicable to the year that is likely to have a material impact on our conduct of the business  our results of operations or our financial condition 
costs to address our year issues 
although we are currently updating our computer systems  such updating was not accelerated due to year issues 
we do not anticipate any further material expenditures related specifically to year compliance 
the following chart reflects our estimated year specific costs  including the estimated cost to update our current computer systems 
estimated conversion cost expense capital hardware  project management   software and custom coding  risks of our year issues 
we do not believe that any year issues will impact our manufacturing 
however  it is possible that year issues may have an impact on our administration 
we believe that our greatest year risk is the risk that our customers and suppliers are not year ready 
failure by us  or our customers or suppliers to adequately address the year issues in a timely manner could have a material impact on our conduct of the business  our results of operations and our financial condition 
accordingly  we plan to address all year issues before problems materialize 
we believe that the associated costs are adequately budgeted for in our business plans 
however  should efforts on our part  our customers and suppliers fail to adequately address their relevant year issues  the most likely worst case scenario would be a total loss of revenue to us 
our contingency plans 
we will produce contingency plans on a case by case basis 
risks 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience cost overruns or delays in the completion of our year project 
factors that could cause such cost overruns or delays include  among other things  an unavailability of properly trained personnel  unforeseen difficulty locating and correcting relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
forward looking statements statements in the foregoing discussion that indicate our company s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations or predictions of the future are forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to  among other risks and uncertainties inherent in our business  the following important factors weather is the most significant factor in determining market demand for our products and is inherently unpredictable 
inclement weather during the spring gardening season and lack of snow during the winter may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the lawn and garden industry is seasonal in nature  with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in january through may 
accordingly  our sales tend to be greater during its third and fourth fiscal quarters 
as a result  our operating results depend significantly on the spring selling season 
to support this sales peak  we must anticipate demand and build inventories of finished goods throughout the fall and winter 
accordingly  our levels of raw materials and finished goods inventories tend to be at their highest  relative to sales  during our first and second fiscal quarters 
these factors increase variations in our quarterly results of operations and potentially expose us to greater adverse effects of changes in economic and industry trends 
moreover  actual demand for our products may vary substantially from the anticipated demand  leaving us with either excess inventory or insufficient inventory to satisfy customer orders 
our ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately of gross sales in fiscal a substantial reduction or cessation of sales to these or other major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain retail distribution channels in the lawn and garden industry  such as mass merchants and home centers  are experiencing consolidation 
there can be no assurance that such consolidation will not have an adverse impact on certain customers or result in a substantial reduction or cessation of purchases of our products by certain customers 
in addition  we are facing increasing pressure from retailers with respect to pricing  co operative advertising and other rebates as the market power of large retailers continues to grow 
there can be no assurance that such pressures will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a key element of our growth strategy is to increase sales in certain distribution channels that we believe are growing more rapidly than the overall industry  such as home centers and mass merchants through retailers such as home depot  lowe s and sears 
there can be no assurance that retailers in such distribution channels will continue to open a significant number of new stores or  if opened  that we will be chosen to supply our products to all or a significant portion of such stores 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such stores will generate significant additional sales for us or that such stores will not result in a reduction of sales to our other customers  whether through consolidation or otherwise 
our future growth and development is largely dependent upon the services of a 
corydon meyer  our president and chief executive officer  as well as our other executive officers 
the loss of mr 
meyer s services  or the services of one or more of our other executive officers  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our products require the supply of raw materials consisting primarily of steel  plastics and ash wood 
although we have several suppliers for most of our raw materials  there can be no assurance that we will not experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply 
in addition  there can be no assurance that prices for such materials will remain stable 
any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all aspects of the lawn and garden industry  including attracting and retaining customers and pricing  are highly competitive 
we compete for customers with large consumer product manufacturers and numerous other companies that produce specialty home and garden products  as well as with foreign manufacturers that export their products to the us many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial resources than us 
there can be no assurance that increased competition in the lawn and garden industry  whether from existing competitors  new domestic manufacturers or additional foreign manufacturers entering the us market  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our hourly employees are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements 
we currently are a party to four such agreements  one of which expires in and three of which expire in there can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating new labor contracts on terms satisfactory to us or without work stoppages or strikes 
a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations governing  among other things  emissions to air  discharge to waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with these environmental requirements and regularly review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws 
we also have been involved in remediation actions with respect to certain facilities 
amounts expended by us in such compliance and remediation activities have not been material to us 
however  current conditions and future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations  may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  as is the case with manufacturers in general  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location  or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of our properties  we may be held liable and the amount of such liability could be material 
new housing starts often represent an addition to the overall number of consumers in the lawn and garden tool market and  accordingly  an increase in demand 
similarly  government spending on highways  bridges and other construction projects often represents an increase in demand for long handled tools 
a decline in housing starts or government spending on construction projects could result in a decrease in demand for our products and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse changes in general economic conditions in the united states  including the level and availability of consumer debt  the level of interest rates and consumer sentiment regarding the economy in general  could result in a decrease in demand for our products and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the factors set forth above are not exhaustive 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we will not undertake  and specifically decline  any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all of such factors  nor can they assess the impact of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
therefore  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation and interest rates 
we have not been significantly affected by inflation in recent years and anticipate that we will not be significantly affected by inflation in the near term 
a material change in interest rates could have an impact on our financial results as we are presently paying a variable interest rate on our outstanding debt 
in october  we entered into an amendment of our existing credit facility the amended facility 
the amended facility provides for a million revolving credit facility from january through june of each year  million from july through october  and million from november through december in connection with the amended facility  the interest rate charges on outstanding borrowings was increased from libor plus to libor plus
