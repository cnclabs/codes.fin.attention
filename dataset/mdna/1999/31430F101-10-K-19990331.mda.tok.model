felcor strives to be the premier full service lodging reit partnered with leading brands and management companies to create shareholder value 
the company is the owner of the largest number of embassy suites r  crowne plaza r  holiday inn r and independently owned doubletree r branded hotels in the world

the principal factors affecting the company s results of operations are acquisitions of hotels  renovations  redevelopments  and rebrandings of hotels  and changes in room and suite revenues measured by revenue per available room revpar 
on july   the company completed the acquisition of the assets of bristol through a merger  which resulted in the net addition of hotels  valued at approximately billion  to the company s portfolio 
in addition to the bristol assets  the company acquired hotels  valued at million 
three of the hotels acquired in the merger were sold prior to december the company continued its program of renovation  redevelopment  and rebranding of hotels  to improve under performing assets and increase revenues 
the company and  prior to the merger  bristol hotel company  spent nearly million in on renovations  redevelopments  rebrandings  room additions to existing hotels  and other hotel improvements 
this strategy continues to be effective in improving revenue performance 
the company s growth has been financed primarily with equity  resulting in a conservative financial structure 
the results of this conservative approach are evidenced by the following  as of december  o interest coverage ratio of x o pro forma interest coverage ratio of x o total debt to pro forma ebitda of x o borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of million o consolidated debt to total assets of o fixed interest rate debt comprising of total debt o secured debt to total assets of o debt of million maturing prior to december  felcor s historical results of operations for   and are summarized as follows in millions  except percentages and hotel counts years ended december  percentage change vs vs hotels owned at year end revenues income before extraordinary charge net income applicable to common shareholders funds from operations ffo results of operations the company actual comparison of the years ended december  and for the years and felcor had total revenue of million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue of million and million 
the hotels owned by the company throughout both of the years and djont comparable hotels  which reflect the effect of the company s ownership and the management by its strategic partners  experienced a growth in revpar during of over the largest portion of this increase came from the former crown sterling suite hotels  which continued their trend of improved revpar throughout  achieving a revpar of in compared to for  an increase of 
these hotels have improved their revpar performance by since the company attributes this dramatic increase to the renovation  redevelopment  and rebranding of these hotels in and early likewise  the bristol comparable hotels those bristol hotels not undergoing renovation in either or produced improved revpar performance of over the improvement in room and suite revenue significantly impacts the company because its principal source of revenue is rent payments from the lessees under the percentage leases 
the percentage leases provide for rent based on a percentage of room and suite revenue  food and beverage revenue  food and beverage rents  and in some instances  other hotel revenues 
the portion of the percentage lease revenue derived from room and suite revenues was approximately in and in the decrease in the portion of percentage lease revenue derived from room and suite revenues is attributed primarily to the more extensive food and beverage operations in the bristol hotels 
the company generally seeks to acquire hotels that management believes can achieve increases in room and suite revenue and revpar as a result of renovation  redevelopment  and rebranding  or a change in management 
however  during the course of such improvements hotel revenue performance is often adversely affected by such temporary factors as out of service rooms and suites and disruptions of hotel operations 
a more detailed discussion of hotel room and suite revenue is contained in the hotels actual section of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
total expenses increased million in over  primarily resulting from the net acquisition of hotels during and hotels in total expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in to from in the major component of the increase in expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  was interest expense 
interest expense increased by million from million in to million in  and increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in the relative increase in interest expense is attributed to the assumption of debt related to the more highly leveraged bristol assets 
debt as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  and taxes  insurance  and other expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and comparison of the years ended december  and for the years and the company had total revenue of million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue of million and million 
the increase in total revenue is primarily attributed to the company s acquisition and subsequent leasing  pursuant to percentage leases  of interests in hotels during this increase represents nearly a increase in the number of hotel interests owned by the company at the end of percentage lease revenue from the hotels which were owned during all of and increased for over an increase of million 
the increase in percentage lease revenue is attributed to a increase in revpar and to the addition of new suites at three existing hotels 
furthermore  revpar at the hotels owned by the company at december   increased during equity in income from unconsolidated entities increased approximately million in over  resulting primarily from an increase in the number of hotels owned through unconsolidated entities from five at december   to at december  total expenses increased million in over  resulting primarily from increased expenses related to the acquisition of additional hotels during and total expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased in to from in the major component of the increased expenses as a percentage of total revenue was interest expense 
interest expense increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this relative increase in interest expense is attributed to the increased use of debt to finance acquisitions and renovations 
debt as a percentage of total assets increased from at december   to at december  as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation increased from in to in the relative increase in depreciation is primarily a result of capital improvements made during and and the resultant depreciation  as well as the increase of short lived assets relative to total fixed assets short lived assets made up of fixed assets at december  and at december  
general and administrative expenses and taxes  insurance  and other expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and funds from operations the company considers funds from operations to be a key measure of a reit s performance which should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flow as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company believes that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities  and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures  and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
funds from operations may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties

as a result of the renovation and rebranding of hotels  approximately of percentage lease revenue is expected to be derived from upscale and full service hotels in the following tables set forth historical occupancy  average daily rate adr  and revpar at december  and  and the percentage changes therein between the years presented for the hotels in which the company had an ownership interest at december  this information is presented regardless of the date of acquisition 
comparable hotels the company believes that  when analyzing the performance of the hotels  looking at comparable hotels is the most meaningful 
for the djont hotels  comparable is defined to include those hotels that were owned throughout all of and this generally includes the hotels that have benefitted from the company s renovation  redevelopment  and rebranding programs and generally excludes those hotels that are currently undergoing renovation and experiencing out of service rooms and suites due to their renovation

in the aggregate  the six hotels identified for sale had a decline in revpar during comparison of the hotels operating statistics for the years ended december  and djont comparable hotels 
the djont comparable hotels revpar increased in over this improvement was driven by an increase in adr of  partially offset by a decrease of approximately one point in occupancy 
forty of the djont comparable hotels are embassy suites hotels 
the strongest performance of the djont comparable hotels came from the css hotels which include former crown sterling suite hotels purchased in and these hotels benefitted from the company s renovation  redevelopment  and rebranding program  under which of these hotels were converted to embassy suites and two to doubletree guest suites hotels 
the renovations  redevelopments  and rebrandings were completed in and early these hotels posted revpar of in  an improvement of over the revpar of and an improvement of over the revpar of 
the original hotels include the hotels acquired by the company from through october while this group of hotels had only a modest increase in revpar of over  room and suite revenue in this group of hotels increased million 
this increase in room and suite revenue resulted from the construction of additional suites at three hotels 
the acquisitions consist of hotels that the company acquired in late and these hotels improved revpar performance by over this improvement is generally attributed to the renovation and redevelopment of these hotels in and bristol comparable hotels

djont actual comparison of the years ended december  and total revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
total revenues consisted primarily of suite revenue of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues is primarily a result of the increase in the number of hotels leased to hotels at december  from hotels at december  suite revenues for the hotels which were leased for all of and increased or million 
the increase in revenues at these hotels is due primarily to improved average daily room rates of  for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december djont recorded a net income of  in compared to a net loss of million in this improvement in operating performance is primarily attributed to improved profitability of food and beverage operations for djont and a decrease in percentage lease expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
food and beverage profits increased to of total revenue in from in  an increase of million 
this change is attributed to the increased number of hotels leased by djont which have a greater emphasis on food and beverage than the traditional embassy suites 
food and beverage revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  increased to in compared to in percentage lease expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to from 
a portion of this change is attributed to the increase in food and beverage revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  which bear a lower percentage rent than room revenues

total revenues consisted primarily of suite revenue of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues is primarily a result of the increase in the number of hotels leased to hotels at december  from hotels at december  suite revenues for the hotels which were leased for all of and increased or million 
the increase in revenues at these hotels is due primarily to improved occupancy and average daily room rates of and  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to and for the year ended december  djont income before percentage lease rent increased in to from of total revenues in primarily as a result of higher revenue earned per available room 
the net loss of approximately million during was half that incurred in and resulted primarily from the one time costs of converting the last of the css hotels to the embassy suites and doubletree guest suites brands and the substantial number of suite nights lost during the year due to renovation 
renovations  redevelopments and rebrandings the company believes that one factor that differentiates it from other hotel companies is its commitment to making capital expenditures where necessary  to renovate  redevelop  and rebrand its hotels 
the company approaches this in five different ways i an aggressive renovation and redevelopment program as hotels are acquired to bring them up to their optimum competitive position  ii rebranding hotels in certain instances to improve the revenue generating capacity of the hotel  iii contributions of at least of annual room and suite revenue for the djont hotels and of total annual hotel revenue for the bristol hotels on a cumulative basis for routine capital replacements and improvements the capital reserve  iv insuring that the lessees adhere to a proactive maintenance and repair program for the hotels amounting to approximately of hotel revenues  and v after the initial renovation and redevelopment  the construction of additional rooms and suites  meeting rooms and public areas where market conditions dictate 
renovation and redevelopment program in  the company and  prior to the merger  bristol hotel company completed approximately million of capital improvements to approximately hotels 
during  approximately of total hotel room nights were out of service due to renovations 
the company presently expects to spend an additional million in capital improvements to hotels during and expects that approximately of total room nights again will be out of service due to renovation

room additions during  the company completed construction of an aggregate of suites at its embassy suites hotels in jacksonville and orlando north  florida  and new orleans  louisiana 
capital reserve it is the company s policy to contribute a minimum of of room and suite revenue from the djont leased hotels and of total hotel revenue from the bristol leased hotels to the capital reserve account in order to provide funds for necessary ongoing capital replacements and improvements after the initial renovation or upgrade 
during approximately million was spent on such replacements and improvements  in addition to the million spent under the renovation and redevelopment program described above 
repairs and maintenance during the year ended december   approximately million and million were spent by the lessees on routine repairs and maintenance at the hotels leased by djont and bristol  respectively 
this represents approximately of total hotel revenues 
liquidity and capital resources felcor s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders and repayments of indebtedness  is its share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue  was million and funds from operations was million 
the lessees obligations under the percentage leases are largely unsecured 
the lessees have limited capital resources  and  accordingly  their ability to make lease payments under the percentage leases is substantially dependent on the ability of the lessees to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels 
at december   the lessees had paid all amounts then due the company under the percentage leases 
during and  djont realized net income of approximately million and a net loss of million 
at december   djont had a cumulative shareholders deficit of approximately million 
the losses in resulted primarily from the one time costs of converting the css hotels to the embassy suites and doubletree guest suites brands and the substantial number of suite nights lost during the year due to renovation 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of any future profits of djont will be retained until a positive shareholders equity is restored 
it is anticipated that djont s future earnings will be sufficient to enable it to continue to make its lease payments under the percentage leases 
certain entities owning interests in djont and the managers of certain hotels have agreed to make loans to djont of up to an aggregate of approximately million to the extent necessary to enable djont to pay rent and other obligations when due under the respective percentage leases relating to a total of of the hotels 
no such loans were outstanding at december  bristol has entered into an absolute and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of the bristol lessees under the percentage leases 
as an additional credit enhancement  the bristol lessees obtained a letter of credit the letter of credit issued by bankers trust company for the benefit of the company in the original amount of million 
this letter of credit is subject to periodic reductions upon satisfaction of certain conditions and is required to be maintained until july  for the period from july  inception of operations through december   bristol earned million of net income and at december   had stockholders equity of million 
the company may acquire additional hotels and may incur indebtedness to make such acquisitions or to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code  to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the company s investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and had utilized million under its million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the following details the company s debt outstanding at december  and in thousands december  collateral interest rate maturity date floating rate debt line of credit unsecured libor bp june   term loan unsecured libor bp december  other unsecured up to libor bp various   total floating rate debt   fixed rate debt line of credit unsecured june   publicly traded term notes unsecured october   publicly traded term notes unsecured october   mortgage debt hotels november  mortgage debt hotels december  other hotels   total fixed rate debt   total debt   the company is currently seeking to refinance the million term loan that matures on december  the line of credit and the term loan contain various affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on total indebtedness  total secured indebtedness  and cash distributions  as well as the obligation to maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth and certain minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios 
at december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than the line of credit and term loan 
most of the collateralized borrowings are nonrecourse to the company with certain exceptions and contain provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of the collateralized borrowings are prepayable  however approximately million is not subject to any prepayment penalty  yield maintenance  or defeasance obligation 
the remaining collateralized borrowings are subject to various prepayment penalties  yield maintenance  or defeasance obligations 
to manage the relative mix of its debt between fixed and variable rate instruments  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with six financial institutions 
these interest rate swap agreements modify a portion of the interest characteristics of the company s outstanding debt under its line of credit without an exchange of the underlying principal amount and effectively convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the fixed rates to be paid  the effective fixed rate  and the variable rate to be received by the company at december   are summarized in the following table swap rate received swap rate effective variable at swap notional amount paid fixed fixed rate maturity million october million november million july million july million july million july million july million the differences to be paid or received by the company under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense by the company and have a corresponding effect on its future cash flows 
agreements such as these contain a credit risk in that the counterparties may be unable to fulfill the terms of the agreement 
the company minimizes that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of its counterparties  who are limited to major banks and financial institutions  and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
to provide for additional financing flexibility  the company has approximately million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  and or common stock warrants available for offerings under shelf registration statements previously declared effective 
the company s cash flow from financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of million depositary shares  representing  shares of felcor s series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock  with net proceeds of million and net borrowings by the company of million  partially offset by distributions paid to common shareholders  preferred shareholders and limited partners of million 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  limit the lessees ability to raise room rates 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy rates primarily during the first three quarters of each year 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenue  particularly during the fourth quarter  to the extent that it receives percentage rent 
to the extent cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  the company expects to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under the line of credit to make distributions to its equity holders 
the year issue the year issue relates to computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in those programs the year may be incorrectly identified as the year  which could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing a disruption of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare financial statements  or engage in other normal business activities 
the company believes that its efforts to identify and resolve the year issues will avoid a major disruption of its business 
the company has assessed its internal computer systems and believes that they will properly utilize dates beyond december  the hotels owned by the company are in various stages of identifying both computer and noninformation technology systems to determine if they are year compliant  including embedded systems that operate elevators  phone systems  energy maintenance systems  security systems  and other systems 
the assessments  which have not been completed at this date  are scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of most of the upgrades to make a hotel year compliant had been anticipated as part of the renovation and redevelopment program that the company generally undertakes upon acquisition of a hotel 
the company currently anticipates that the total cost to remediate all hotel year issues to be approximately million  which is included in the company s capital plans 
the company has requested and received assurances from the managers of the hotels  the franchisors of the hotels and the lessees  that they have implemented appropriate steps to insure that they will avoid a major disruption of business due to year issues 
concurrent with the assessment of the year issue  the company and its hotel managers and lessees are developing contingency plans intended to mitigate the possible disruption in business operations that may result from year issues and are developing cost estimates for such plans 
once developed  contingency plans and related cost estimates will be continually refined as additional information becomes available
