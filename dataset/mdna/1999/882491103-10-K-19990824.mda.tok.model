the profit also included million in income from the company s litigation against certain graphite electrode suppliers 
steel profits are being adversely impacted by the unprecedented volume of steel imports from russia  asia and south america 
as an international low cost supplier of structural steel products  the company s focus has shifted from maximizing margins to maintaining market share  and thus  the company has reduced structural beam prices accordingly 
as a result  near term unit margins for these products could continue to decline 
as the company s new virginia steel plant begins operations during the august quarter it is anticipated that start up costs and higher than normal unit operating costs due to lower production as the plant is brought on line will adversely affect near term results

other items litigation 
on november   chaparral steel company  a wholly owned subsidiary  filed an action seeking damages  trebled as allowed by law  plus interest and costs  in the district court of ellis county  texas against showa denko carbon  inc sdc  showa financing  kk  showa denko  kk  the carbide graphite group  inc cgg  sgl carbon aktiengesellschaft  sgl carbon corp  ucar carbon company  inc ucar  and ucar international  inc 
collectively defendants asserting causes of action for illegal restraints of trade in the sale of graphite electrodes 
in january  sdc and its affiliates settled with chaparral steel company and were removed from the action 
in related criminal actions  two of the defendants have pled guilty to criminal violations of the us antitrust laws and have paid fines  and a third defendant has announced that it has agreed to cooperate with the us department of justice investigation into the graphite electrode industry in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution for it and some of its executives 
for these reasons  although the company s action is still in its preliminary stages  the company believes that it should  subject to inherent uncertainties of litigation  prevail in its claims against the remaining defendants 
environmental matters 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions  furnace dust disposal and wastewater discharge 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  however  from time to time the company receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that the company is or may be liable for environment cleanup costs and related damages 
based on its experience and the information currently available to it  the company believes that such claims will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
despite the company s compliance and experience  it is possible that the company could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by the company 
year compliance 
the company created a task force comprised of representatives from each of its business units to identify year issues 
an assessment of both the financial and management information systems and the manufacturing process control  man machine interface and other operational systems was conducted 
based on the results of that assessment  the task force determined that modification or upgrading certain equipment and software would be necessary 
the task force members are actively engaged in  but have not yet completed reviewing  correcting and testing all of the year issues 
in addition  written contingency plans have been developed for all business units and are continually being reassessed and updated 
the company began converting its computerized business systems in in order to upgrade system capabilities and utilize current hardware and software technology 
to date  substantially all of these systems have been converted and the company believes them to be year compliant 
the company has conducted internal investigations of its manufacturing process control systems and other devices with embedded microprocessor controls and is substantially complete with the upgrade or replacement of time sensitive programs or microprocessors and testing compliance 
completion of all phases of the work is expected by the fall of the company believes that neither the cost of its planned upgrade and modification program nor a failure to complete such program will have a material impact on the operations or financial condition of the company 
during approximately million was incurred with current estimates anticipating to million in additional year expense 
to develop contingency plans the company has contacted its critical suppliers and others to determine the extent to which the company would be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company has received written assurances from the most critical business partners and has not been informed of any material risks associated with other entities 
while the company expects that it will not experience a disruption of its operations  potential problem areas do exist which could materially affect actual results 
this would include the company s inability to identify and correct all computer codes or non complying microprocessors embedded in other digitally controlled equipment and the significant degree of interdependence with third party suppliers  service providers and customers 
in addition  problems relating to the company s dependency on public utilities  transportation  postal  banking and telecommunication systems which are outside of its control could disrupt the company s ability to process orders  manufacture and deliver finished goods  invoice customers or disburse or receive funds 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to the company s own operations would be a shut down of a production system caused by an unforeseen problem with an automated monitoring or control device 
the company s contingency planning continues to address risks and possible countermeasures that include manual operation of control systems and equipment or the replacement of certain equipment on an emergency basis 
it is not possible  however  to plan for all contingencies 
the company is unable to determine the impact  material or otherwise  if other companies on which it relies do not achieve year compliance 
market risk 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of the company s investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value 
the current fair value of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  does not exceed its carrying value 
market risk  when estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rate  would not have a significant impact on the carrying value of long term debt
