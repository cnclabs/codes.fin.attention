upon completion of the santa anita mergers  santa anita realty enterprises  inc changed its corporate name to meditrust corporation and santa anita operating company changed its corporate name to meditrust operating company 
the santa anita mergers were accounted for as reverse acquisitions whereby meditrust and meditrust acquisition company were treated as the acquirers for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the financial history is that of meditrust and meditrust acquisition company prior to the santa anita mergers 
for the year ended december   all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchange of shares of beneficial interest for paired common shares of the companies 
after completing the santa anita merger  the companies began pursuing a strategy of diversifying into additional new businesses 
implementation of this strategy included the evaluation of numerous potential acquisition targets 
on january  and january   realty entered into definitive merger agreements for la quinta inns  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries and its unincorporated partnership and joint venture collectively la quinta and la quinta merger and cobblestone holdings  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary collectively cobblestone and cobblestone merger  respectively 
in february  legislation was proposed which limited the ability of the companies to utilize the paired share structure 
accordingly  the companies began a process of evaluating its healthcare portfolio and ceased any further evaluation of potential merger candidates 
the companies consummated the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger on may  and july  respectively 
on july   president william j 
clinton signed into law the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act  which limits the companies ability to grow through use of the paired share structure 
while the companies use of the paired share structure in connection with the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger was grandfathered under the reform act  the ability to use the paired share structure to acquire additional real estate and operating businesses conducted with the real estate assets including the golf and lodging industries was substantially limited 
in addition  during the summer of  the debt and equity capital markets available to reits deteriorated  thus limiting the companies access to cost efficient capital 
the companies began an analysis of the impact of the reform act  the companies limited ability to access the capital markets  and the operating strategy of the companies existing businesses 
this analysis included advice from outside professional advisors and presentations by management on the different alternatives available to the companies 
the analysis culminated in the development of a comprehensive restructuring plan the plan designed to strengthen the companies financial position and clarify its investment and operating strategy by focusing on the healthcare and lodging business segments 
the plan was announced on november  and included the following components o pursue the separation of the companies primary businesses  healthcare and lodging  by creating two separately traded publicly listed reits 
the companies intend to spin off the healthcare financing business into a stand alone reit  o continue to operate the companies healthcare and lodging businesses using the existing paired share reit structure until the healthcare spin off takes place  o sell more than billion of non strategic assets  including the portfolio of golf related real estate and operating properties cobblestone golf group  the santa anita racetrack and approximately million of non strategic healthcare properties  o use the proceeds from these asset sales to achieve significant near term debt reduction  o settle fully the companies forward equity issuance transaction feit with merrill lynch  o reduce capital investments to reflect the current operating condition in each industry  o reset realty s annual dividend to per common share  an amount that realty deems sustainable and comparable to its peer groups during and in early  the companies made significant progress in implementing  and in some cases completing  significant components of the plan 
the following summarizes the status of the plan by substantial components o completed the sale of million of billion in planned asset sales  including million of non strategic healthcare assets  the santa anita racetrack and the related horseracing operation  its interest in the santa anita fashion mall and related land held for development and artwork originally acquired in the acquisition of the santa anita companies  o entered into letters of intent for the sale of an additional million of healthcare assets 
o reduced the amount of the feit to million as of december  million as of march  from the original million 
o reduced the companies outstanding debt by million 
o refocused the companies capital investment program to respond to industry trends by reducing planned healthcare investments to million in and ceasing construction of any new hotels after completion of the la quinta inn suites currently under development 
o reduced realty s annual dividend to per common share 
o entered into a definitive agreement to sell cobblestone golf group for  and an agreement with its lenders and merrill lynch to settle the feit 
as part of the comprehensive restructuring plan  the companies classified golf and horseracing activities as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations are focused on the companies primary businesses  healthcare and lodging 
the meditrust companies combined results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  revenue growth was primarily attributable to the addition of hotel operating revenue of  and increased rental and interest income of  as a result of additional real estate investments made over the last year net of the affect of mortgage repayments and asset sales 
other non recurring income for the year ended december  of  included prepayment and lease breakage fees arising from early mortgage repayments and asset sales 
hotel operating revenue includes the post acquisition period from july  through december  hotel operating revenue generally are measured as a function of the average daily rate adr and occupancy 
the adr for the period july  through december  increased to as compared to adr in the second half of of  an increase of or 
occupancy percentage decreased percentage points to from for the same periods 
revenue per available room revpar  which is a product of the occupancy percentage and adr  increased in the post merger period over the second half of for the year ended december   total recurring operating expenses increased by  this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of operating expenses from hotel operations of  hotel operating expenses include costs associated with the operation such as salaries and wages  utilities  repair and maintenance  credit card discounts and room supplies as well as corporate expenses  such as the costs of general management  office rent  training and field supervision of hotel managers and other marketing and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   rental property operating expenses were   of which is related to the lodging segment and  of which is related to the healthcare business 
rental property operating expenses for the year ended december  related to the healthcare business increased by  compared to the year ended december  the increase arose primarily from expenses related to the management and operation of medical office buildings that were purchased in rental property operating costs attributed to the lodging segment which were incurred during the post acquisition period from july  through december   principally consist of property taxes on hotel facilities 
general and administrative expenses increased by  primarily due to a higher level of operating costs associated with the management and activity of the portfolio and as a result of the mergers 
the companies consider contribution from each primary business in evaluating performance 
contribution includes revenue from each business  excluding non recurring or unusual income  less operating expenses  rental property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses 
the combined contribution of the healthcare and lodging businesses was  for the year ended december  and  for the healthcare business for the year ended december  the healthcare contribution for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased rental and interest income as a result of real estate investments made over the last year  net of the effect of mortgage repayments and asset sales 
these increases were partially offset by a higher level of operating costs associated with the management and activity of the portfolio  and from expenses related to management of medical office buildings that were purchased in the lodging contribution for the post merger period of july  through december  was  or of lodging revenues during the same period  compared to for the second half of this improvement is reflective of a greater number of inn suites hotels which generally operate at higher margins than la quinta inns and a continuing focus on cost controls and reduced corporate overhead 
interest expense increased by  due to increases in debt outstanding resulting from additional real estate investments made over the past year and the acquisitions of la quinta and cobblestone 
depreciation and amortization increased by  which was primarily a result of increased real estate investments and amortization of goodwill from the la quinta merger completed on july  and the santa anita merger completed in goodwill associated with the santa anita merger primarily relates to the value of the paired share structure and  due to the permanent nature of the structure  is being amortized over a year period 
accordingly  the goodwill recorded as part of the santa anita merger is expected to remain even though the santa anita racetrack was sold in  as long as the companies continue to utilize the paired share structure 
asset sales during the year ended december   realty realized gains on the sale of real estate assets of  sale of healthcare properties  pursuant to the comprehensive restructuring plan accounted for  of the total and included one long term care facility  assisted living facilities and nine rehabilitation facilities

consistent with this strategy  realty commenced a reevaluation of its intentions with respect to certain existing healthcare real estate facilities and other assets 
this process included review of the valuation of facilities in the portfolio  including those with deteriorating performance  and other assets and receivables that were unrelated to its historical primary business 
as a result of this on going analysis realty identified assets which would be held for sale and recorded provisions to adjust the carrying value of certain facilities  other assets and receivables and a valuation reserve for certain mortgage loans receivable 
following the quarter ended march  one facility was sold and certain other assets and receivables were written off 
on july   the president signed into law the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act  which limits the companies ability to continue to grow through use of the paired share structure 
while the companies use of the paired share structure in connection with the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger was grandfathered under the reform act  the ability to continue to use the paired share structure to acquire additional real estate and operating businesses conducted with the real estate assets including the golf and lodging industries was substantially limited 
in addition  during the summer of  the debt and equity capital markets available to reits deteriorated  thus limiting the companies access to cost efficient capital 
as a result of these events  the companies commenced a strategic evaluation of their business which included an extensive review of their healthcare properties and mortgage loan portfolio  an analysis of the impact of the reform act  the companies limited ability to access the capital markets  and the operating strategy of the companies existing businesses 
the analysis culminated in the development of a comprehensive restructuring plan  which was announced on november   which included the sale of approximately million of non strategic healthcare assets 
based upon the analysis described above  other expenses were recorded for the year ended december   as follows asset related in thousands provision for assets held for sale  provision for real estate assets  provision for loss on real estate mortgage and loans receivable  provision for loss on working capital and other receivables  subtotal  in thousands comprehensive restructuring plan employee severance  write off of capitalized pre development costs  external consulting fees  subtotal  other costs of transactions not consummated  total  as a result of continued deteriorating performance at five healthcare facilities  management committed to a plan to sell these facilities as soon as practicable 
as of december   realty had recorded a provision  net of one facility that was sold prior to the end of the year  of  to reduce the carrying value of these facilities to estimated fair value less expected costs of sale 
management expects that the remaining assets will be disposed of during as part of the review of the healthcare portfolio  management identified four properties where recent events or changes in circumstances  including physical plant and licensure issues  indicated that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
management determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for these assets was below the carrying value and  accordingly  realty reduced the carrying value of these assets by  to estimated fair value 
management also identified one mortgage loan collateralized by a rehabilitation facility where continued eroding margins and an expiring guarantee indicated that the companies will likely not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
accordingly  the companies provided a loan loss for this asset of approximately  in addition  realty has also provided for the establishment of an additional  mortgage loan valuation reserve primarily in response to the implementation of new government reimbursement regulations impacting many of its third party operators during the second half of realty also held working capital and other receivables that were unrelated to its historical primary business of healthcare financing 
management determined that certain of these accounts were uncollectible and protracted collection efforts for these assets would be an inefficient use of its resources and therefore recorded provisions of approximately  and then wrote off these assets 
pursuant to its comprehensive restructuring plan  the companies announced plans to refocus their capital investment program by reducing healthcare investments and ceasing development of any new hotels other than the completion of those la quinta 
regtm 
inns and suites currently under construction 
accordingly  the companies recorded non recurring costs of  for the write off of certain previously capitalized costs associated with lodging development  and  for severance related costs attributable to workforce reductions of employees at the companies lodging and healthcare divisions

during the third quarter of  the companies reassessed these business segments 
in addition  a review of investment and operating strategies for the companies was initiated 
as a result  on november   the companies approved a comprehensive restructuring plan including the disposal of the horseracing and golf segments as well as the sale of certain healthcare and other non strategic assets 
accordingly  the companies have classified approximately  of income from the horseracing and golf segments as discontinued during the year ended december   and  of income from the horseracing segment during the year ended december  the horseracing segment was sold on december   resulting in a net loss on disposal of  the companies have also recorded a provision for loss on disposal  based upon the estimated proceeds to be realized upon sale  of the cobblestone golf group  of approximately  subsequent to the end of  the companies entered into a definitive agreement to sell the cobblestone golf group for  and expect the transaction to close in early which should not change the estimated loss on disposal presented herein 
net loss the resulting net loss available for common shareholders  after deducting preferred share dividends  for the year ended december   was  compared to net income of  for the year ended december  the net loss per paired common share for the year ended december  was compared to net income per paired common share of for the year ended december  the per paired common share amount decreased primarily due to the provisions for impairment and discontinued operations  loss on sale of assets and restructuring charges  and additional paired common shares being issued to consummate mergers 
in connection with the cobblestone and la quinta mergers   and  additional paired common shares are now outstanding  respectively 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenues and expenses for the years ended december  and are principally related to healthcare related real estate activities 
revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
revenue growth was primarily attributed to increased rental income of  and increased interest income of  these increases resulted from additional real estate investments in healthcare facilities made over the last twelve months 
for the year ended december   total expenses increased by  interest expense increased by  due to increases in debt outstanding resulting from additional real estate investments made over the past twelve months 
this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates compared to depreciation and amortization increased by  as a result of increased real estate investments and associated debt issuance costs 
general and administrative and other expenses increased by  principally due to a higher level of operating costs associated with portfolio growth 
amortization of goodwill increased by  as a result of amortization of the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in the santa anita merger 
goodwill associated with the santa anita merger primarily relates to the value of the paired share structure and  due to the permanent nature of the structure  is being amortized over a year period 
accordingly  the goodwill recorded as part of the santa anita merger is expected to remain even though the santa anita racetrack was sold in  as long as the companies continue to utilize the paired share structure 
on november   the companies approved a comprehensive restructuring plan including the disposal of the horseracing segment 
accordingly  the companies have classified approximately  of income from the horseracing segment as discontinued during the year ended december  prior to  the companies were not engaged in horseracing 
net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
net income per paired common share decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of 
or 
the per share decrease was primarily due to dilution caused by the santa anita merger 
per share amounts have been restated to reflect the exchange of meditrust shares of beneficial interest for paired common shares of the companies pursuant to the santa anita merger 
the meditrust companies combined liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities the principal source of cash to be used to fund the companies future operating expenses  interest expense  recurring capital expenditures and distribution payments will be cash flow provided by operating activities 
the companies anticipate that cash flow provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds on a short and long term basis to meet operating cash requirements including all distributions to shareholders 
cash flows from investing and financing activities the companies provide funding for new investments and costs associated with the restructuring through a combination of long term and short term financing including  both debt and equity  as well as the sale of assets 
the companies obtain long term financing through the issuance of shares  long term unsecured notes  convertible debentures and the assumption of mortgage notes 
the companies obtain short term financing through the use of bank lines of credit  which are replaced with long term financing as appropriate 
from time to time  the companies may utilize interest rate caps or swaps to attempt to hedge interest rate volatility 
it is the companies objective to match mortgage and lease terms with the terms of their borrowings 
the companies attempt to maintain an appropriate spread between their borrowing costs and the rate of return on their investments 
when development loans convert to sale leaseback transactions or permanent mortgage loans  the base rent or interest rate  as appropriate  is fixed at the time of such conversion 
there is  however  no assurance that the companies will satisfactorily achieve  if at all  the objectives set forth in this paragraph 
on february   the companies entered into transactions the forward equity issuance transaction or feit with merrill lynch international  a uk based broker dealer subsidiary of merrill lynch co  inc collectively with its agent and successor in interest  mli 
pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement  mli purchased  shares of series a non voting convertible common stock par value 
per share from each of the companies at a purchase price of per share collectively with the paired common shares the shares of series a non voting convertible common stock are convertible into  the notional shares 
the series a non voting convertible common stock converted on a one to one basis to paired common stock of the companies on june  total proceeds from the issuance were approximately  the initial reference amount 
net proceeds from the issuance were approximately  and were used by the companies to repay existing indebtedness 
the companies and mli also entered into a purchase price adjustment agreement under which the companies would  within one year from the date of mli s purchase  on a periodic basis  adjust the purchase price based on the market price of the paired common stock at the time of any interim or final adjustments  so as to provide mli with a guaranteed return of libor plus basis points the return 
the paired common shares issued receive the same dividend as the companies paired common stock  however  the difference between libor plus basis points and the dividend payments received by mli will be included as an additional adjustment under the purchase price adjustment agreement 
such adjustments were to be effected by deliveries of additional paired common shares to  or  receipts of paired common shares from  mli 
in the event that the market price for the paired shares is not high enough to provide mli with the return  the companies would have to deliver additional paired shares to mli  which would have a dilutive effect on the capital stock of the companies 
this dilutive effect increases significantly as the market price of the paired shares declines further below the original purchase price 
moreover  settlement of the feit transaction  whether at maturity or at an earlier date  may force the companies to issue paired shares at a depressed price  which may heighten this dilutive effect on the capital stock of the companies 
prior to the settlement  mli shall hold any paired common shares delivered by the companies under the purchase price adjustment agreement in a collateral account the collateral shares 
under the adjustment mechanism  the companies delivered approximately  collateral shares in  all of which were returned to the companies when the companies settled in cash a portion of the adjustment transaction in december the feit has been accounted for as an equity transaction with the notional shares treated as outstanding from their date of issuance until the respective date of repurchase  if any  for both basic and diluted earnings per share purposes 
for diluted earnings per share purposes  at the end of the quarterly period  the then outstanding reference amount as defined herein is divided by the quoted market price of a paired common share  and the excess  if applicable  of that number of paired common shares over the notional shares the contingent shares is added to the denominator 
contingent shares are included in the calculation of year to date diluted earnings per share weighted for the interim periods in which they were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share 
the reference amount equals the initial reference amount plus the return and net of any cash distributions on the notional shares or any other cash paid or otherwise delivered to mli under the feit 
payments that reduce the reference amount in effect satisfy all necessary conditions for physically settling that portion of the reference amount and are accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock 
therefore  payments that reduce the reference amount are divided by the quoted market price of a paired common share on the date of payment 
the calculated number is then multiplied by the fractional number of days in the period prior to the payment date and the resulting number of paired common shares is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the period 
on november   the companies entered into an agreement with mli to amend the feit 
under the agreement  realty agreed to grant a mortgage of the santa anita racetrack to mli and repurchase from mli approximately of the feit with cash generated in part from the sale of certain assets  including the santa anita racetrack

on march   the companies entered into an agreement with mli and certain of its affiliates to use the proceeds from the sale of cobblestone golf group in excess of million to purchase all or a portion of the remaining notional shares

management considers funds from operations to be a key external measurement of reit performance 
funds from operations represents net income or loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding real estate related depreciation  amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets  gains and losses from the sale of assets and non recurring income and expenses 
for  non recurring income primarily consists of gains attributable to the prepayment of loans and lease breakage fees  while non recurring expenses include charges related to the sale of discontinued operations  asset impairments and comprehensive restructuring costs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally acceptable accounting principals as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
the following reconciliation of net income and loss available to common shareholders to funds from operations illustrates the difference between the two measures of operating performance for the years ended december  and certain reconciling items include amounts reclassified from income from operations of discontinued operations and  accordingly  do not necessarily agree to revenue and expense captions in the companies financial statements 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss available to common shareholders   depreciation of real estate and intangible amortization   provision for loss on sale of discontinued operations  other capital gains and losses  other income  other expenses  funds from operations   weighted average paired common shares outstanding basic   diluted   realty results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  revenue growth was primarily attributable to the addition of rent and royalty income and interest of  and other income of  from operating  related to hotel facilities acquired in the la quinta merger 
revenue growth also arose from increased rental and interest income of  due to additional real estate investments made over the last year  net of the effect of mortgage prepayments and asset sales 
other non recurring income for the year ended december  of  included prepayment and lease breakage fees resulting from early mortgage repayments and asset sales 
for the year ended december   total recurring expenses increased by  interest expense increased  due to increases in debt outstanding resulting from additional real estate investments made over the past year and the acquisitions of la quinta and cobblestone 
depreciation and amortization increased by  which was primarily a result of increased real estate investments and amortization of goodwill from the la quinta acquisition completed on july  and the santa anita merger completed in goodwill associated with the santa anita merger primarily relates to the value of the paired share structure and  due to the permanent nature of the structure  is being amortized over a year period 
accordingly  the goodwill recorded as part of the santa anita merger is expected to remain even though the santa anita racetrack was sold in  as long as the companies continue to utilize the paired share structure 
general and administrative and other expenses increased by  primarily due to a higher level of operating costs associated with the management and activity of the portfolio and as a result of the la quinta merger 
rental and hotel property operating expenses increased by  primarily due to property taxes incurred at hotel facilities and expenses related to the management and operation of medical office buildings that were purchased in asset sales during the year ended december   realty realized gains on sale of assets of  sale of healthcare properties  pursuant to the comprehensive restructuring plan accounted for  of the total and included one long term care facility  assisted living facilities and nine rehabilitation facilities

consistent with this strategy  realty commenced a reevaluation of its intentions with respect to certain existing healthcare real estate facilities and other assets 
this process included review of the valuation of facilities in the portfolio  including those with deteriorating performance  and other assets and receivables that were unrelated to its historical primary business 
as a result of this on going analysis realty identified assets which would be held for sale and recorded provisions to adjust the carrying value of certain facilities  other assets and receivables and a valuation reserve for certain mortgage loans receivable 
following the quarter ended march  one facility was sold and certain other assets and receivables were written off 
on july   the president signed into law the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act  which limits the companies ability to continue to grow through use of the paired share structure 
while the companies use of the paired share structure in connection with the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger was grandfathered under the reform act  the ability to continue to use the paired share structure to acquire additional real estate and operating businesses conducted with the real estate assets including the golf and lodging industries was substantially limited 
in addition  during the summer of  the debt and equity capital markets available to reits deteriorated  thus limiting the companies access to cost efficient capital 
as a result of these events  the companies commenced a strategic evaluation of their business which included an extensive review of their healthcare properties and mortgage loan portfolio  an analysis of the impact of the reform act  the companies limited ability to access the capital markets  and the operating strategy of the companies existing businesses 
the analysis culminated in the development of a comprehensive restructuring plan  which was announced on november   which included the sale of approximately million of non strategic healthcare assets

as of december   realty had recorded a provision  net of one facility that was sold prior to the end of the year  of  to reduce the carrying value of these facilities to estimated fair value less expected costs of sale 
management expects that the remaining assets will be disposed of during as part of the review of the healthcare portfolio  management identified four properties where recent events or changes in circumstances  including physical plant and licensure issues  indicated that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
management determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for these assets was below the carrying value and  accordingly  realty reduced the carrying value of these assets by  to estimated fair value 
management also identified one mortgage loan collateralized by a rehabilitation facility where continued eroding margins and an expiring guarantee indicated that the companies will likely not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
accordingly  the companies provided a loan loss for this asset of approximately  in addition  realty has also provided for the establishment of an additional  mortgage loan valuation allowance primarily in response to the implementation of new government reimbursement regulations impacting many of its operators during the second half of realty also held working capital and other receivables that were unrelated to its historical primary business of healthcare financing 
management determined that certain of these accounts were uncollectible and protracted collection efforts for these assets would be an inefficient use of its resources and therefore recorded provisions of approximately  and then wrote off these assets 
pursuant to its comprehensive restructuring plan  the companies announced plans to refocus their capital investment program by reducing new healthcare investments for and ceasing development of any hotels other than the completion of those inns and suites currently under construction 
accordingly  realty recorded non recurring costs of  during these costs included severance attributable to workforce reductions of approximately employees  primarily from realty property management  marketing and acquisition departments of  in addition  realty recorded  in costs associated incurred for various consultants engaged to assist in the development and implementation of the comprehensive restructuring plan 
realty also incurred  in costs related to the evaluation of certain acquisition targets  which realty is no longer pursuing 
discontinued operations during the latter part of and the first half of  the companies pursued a strategy of diversifying into new businesses including horseracing  golf and lodging 
during the third quarter of  the companies reassessed these business segments 
in addition  a review of investment and operating strategies for the companies was initiated 
as a result  on november   the companies approved a comprehensive restructuring plan including the disposal of the horseracing and golf segments as well as the sale of certain healthcare and other non strategic assets 
accordingly  realty has classified approximately  of income from the horseracing and golf segments as discontinued during the year ended december  and  of income from the horseracing segment during the year ended december  the horseracing segment was sold on december   resulting in a net loss on disposal of  realty also recorded a provision for loss on disposal of approximately  based upon the estimated proceeds to be realized upon sale  of the golf related assets 
subsequent to the end of  the companies entered into a definitive agreement to sell the cobblestone golf group for  and expect the transaction to close in early which should not change the estimated loss on disposal presented herein 
net loss the resulting net loss available for common shareholders  after deducting preferred share dividends  for the year ended december   was  compared to net income of  for the year ended december  the net loss available per common share for the year ended december  was compared to net income per common share of for the year ended december  the per common share amount decreased primarily due to the provisions for impairment and discontinued operations  loss on sale of assets and restructuring charges  and additional common shares being issued to consummate mergers 
in connection with the cobblestone and la quinta mergers   and  additional paired common shares are now outstanding  respectively 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
revenue growth was primarily attributed to increased rental income of  and increased interest income of  these increases resulted primarily from additional real estate investments made over the last twelve months 
for the year ended december   total expenses increased by  interest expense increased by  due to increases in debt outstanding resulting from additional real estate investments made over the past twelve months 
this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates compared to depreciation and amortization increased by  as a result of increased real estate investments and associated debt issuance costs 
general and administrative and other expenses increased by  principally due to a higher level of operating costs associated with portfolio growth 
amortization of goodwill increased by  as a result of amortization of the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in the santa anita merger 
goodwill associated with the santa anita merger primarily relates to the value of the paired share structure and  due to the permanent nature of the structure  is being amortized over a year period 
accordingly  the goodwill recorded as part of the santa anita merger is expected to remain even though the santa anita racetrack was sold in  as long as the companies continue to utilize the paired share structure 
on november   the companies approved a comprehensive restructuring plan including the disposal of the horseracing segment 
accordingly  realty has classified approximately  of income from the horseracing segment as discontinued during the year ended december  prior to  the companies were not engaged in horseracing net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
net income per common share decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of 
or 
the per common share decrease was primarily due to dilution caused by the santa anita merger 
per share amounts have been restated to reflect the exchange of meditrust shares of beneficial interest for paired common shares of the companies pursuant to the santa anita merger 
realty liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities the principal source of cash to be used to fund realty s future operating expenses  interest expense  recurring capital expenditures and distribution payments will be cash flow provided by operating activities 
realty anticipates that cash flow provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds on a short and long term basis to meet operating cash requirements including all distributions to shareholders 
cash flows from investing and financing activities realty provides funding for new investments and costs associated with the restructuring through a combination of long term and short term financing including  both debt and equity  as well as the sale of assets 
realty obtains long term financing through the issuance of shares  long term unsecured notes  convertible debentures and the assumption of mortgage notes 
realty obtains short term financing through the use of bank lines of credit  which are replaced with long term financing as appropriate 
from time to time  realty may utilize interest rate caps or swaps to attempt to hedge interest rate volatility 
it is realty s objective to match mortgage and lease terms with the terms of their borrowings 
realty attempts to maintain an appropriate spread between its borrowing costs and the rate of return on its investments 
when development loans convert to sale leaseback transactions or permanent mortgage loans  the base rent or interest rate  as appropriate  is fixed at the time of such conversion 
there is  however  no assurance that realty will satisfactorily achieve  if at all  the objectives set forth in this paragraph 
on february   the companies entered into transactions the forward equity issuance transaction or feit with merrill lynch international  a uk based broker dealer subsidiary of merrill lynch co  inc collectively with its agent and successor in interest  mli 
pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement  mli purchased  shares of series a non voting convertible common stock par value 
per share from each of the companies at a purchase price of per share collectively with the paired common shares the shares of series a non voting convertible common stock are convertible into  the notional shares 
the series a non voting convertible common stock converted on a one to one basis to paired common stock of the companies on june  total proceeds from the issuance were approximately  the initial reference amount 
net proceeds from the issuance were approximately  and were used by the companies to repay existing indebtedness 
the companies and mli also entered into a purchase price adjustment agreement under which the companies would  within one year from the date of mli s purchase  on a periodic basis  adjust the purchase price based on the market price of the paired common stock at the time of any interim or final adjustments  so as to provide mli with a guaranteed return of libor plus basis points the return 
the paired common shares issued receive the same dividend as the companies paired common stock  however  the difference between libor plus basis points and the dividend payments received by mli will be included as an additional adjustment under the purchase price adjustment agreement 
such adjustments were to be effected by deliveries of additional paired common shares to  or  receipts of paired common shares from  mli 
in the event that the market price for the paired shares is not high enough to provide mli with the return  the companies would have to deliver additional paired shares to mli  which would have a dilutive effect on the capital stock of the companies 
this dilutive effect increases significantly as the market price of the paired shares declines further below the original purchase price 
moreover  settlement of the feit transaction  whether at maturity or at an earlier date  may force the companies to issue paired shares at a depressed price  which may heighten this dilutive effect on the capital stock of the companies

under the adjustment mechanism  the companies delivered approximately  collateral shares in  all of which were returned to the companies when the companies settled in cash a portion of the adjustment transaction in december the feit has been accounted for as an equity transaction with the notional shares treated as outstanding from their date of issuance until the respective date of repurchase  if any  for both basic and diluted earnings per share purposes 
for diluted earnings per share purposes  at the end of the quarterly period  the then outstanding reference amount as defined herein is divided by the quoted market price of a paired common share  and the excess  if applicable  of that number of paired common shares over the notional shares the contingent shares is added to the denominator 
contingent shares are included in the calculation of year to date diluted earnings per share weighted for the interim periods in which they were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share 
the reference amount equals the initial reference amount plus the return and net of any cash distributions on the notional shares or any other cash paid or otherwise delivered to mli under the feit 
payments that reduce the reference amount in effect satisfy all necessary conditions for physically settling that portion of the reference amount and are accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock 
therefore  payments that reduce the reference amount are divided by the quoted market price of a paired common share on the date of payment 
the calculated number is then multiplied by the fractional number of days in the period prior to the payment date and the resulting number of paired common shares is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the period 
on november   the companies entered into an agreement with mli to amend the feit

there is an exception for improvements placed in service before january  pursuant to a binding contract in effect on december  and at all times thereafter 
this restriction on property improvements applies to the properties acquired from la quinta and cobblestone  as well as all other properties owned by the companies  and limits the ability of the companies to improve or change the use of those properties after december  the companies are considering various steps which they might take in order to minimize the effect of the reform act 
in its fiscal year budget released on february   the clinton administration proposed legislation that could significantly affect the use of taxable subsidiaries by the meditrust companies 
under the proposed legislation  a reit would be prohibited from owning more than percent by vote or value of the securities of an issuer  other than qualified reit subsidiaries or a new category of subsidiaries termed taxable reit subsidiaries 
under the administration proposal  stock in taxable reit subsidiaries could not exceed percent of a reit s assets  and of this percent amount  no more than percent of the reit s assets could consist of stock of subsidiaries that provide services to the reit s tenants 
in contrast  the current law percent ownership limitation is on a vote rather than a vote or value basis  and the total value of interests in taxable subsidiaries is limited only by the overall limitation of non real estate assets to percent of a reit s total assets 
the administration proposal would also eliminate all interest deductions to a taxable reit subsidiary on debt funded directly or indirectly by the reit and would impose a percent excise tax on excess payments to ensure arm s length pricing for services provided to reit tenants and allocation of shared expenses between the reit and the taxable reit subsidiary 
as proposed  the legislation would be effective after the date of enactment but would apply to existing arrangements  and it could limit the ability of the meditrust companies to acquire and operate through taxable subsidiaries non grandfathered property subject to the anti pairing rules 
it is unclear whether  or in what form  this proposed legislation will be enacted 
restructuring the operations of realty and operating to comply with the recent legislation may cause the companies to incur substantial tax liabilities  to recognize an impairment loss on their goodwill asset or otherwise adversely affect the companies 
other events on november   the boards of directors of realty and operating unanimously approved a comprehensive restructuring plan designed to strengthen the companies financial position and clarify their investment and operating strategy by focusing on the healthcare and lodging business segments 
the comprehensive plan includes pursuing the separation of its primary businesses  healthcare and lodging  by creating two separately listed  publicly traded reits to be accomplished by a spin off of the healthcare financing business into a stand alone reit during the latter part of the plan contemplates continuation of operation of the healthcare and lodging businesses using the existing paired share structure until the healthcare spin off takes place 
the plan also contemplates that the companies will sell over  of non strategic assets  including the cobblestone golf group  the santa anita racetrack and approximately  of non strategic healthcare properties 
proceeds from the sales of these assets will be used to achieve significant near term debt reduction 
during the fourth quarter  the companies made significant progress towards achieving these goals 
on december   the santa anita racetrack was sold for  additionally  healthcare assets were sold for  mortgage investments of  were repaid  and a interest in a joint venture which holds a fashion mall  as well as the land on which the fashion mall is located  was sold for  on february   the companies signed a definitive agreement to sell the cobblestone golf group real estate and operations for aggregate consideration  including assumed debt of approximately  the transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of also  the companies have entered into letters of intent for the sale of an additional  of healthcare assets 
the comprehensive restructuring plan also includes goals related to reducing capital investments to reflect current industry operating conditions and resetting the annual dividend amount to per paired common share  an amount that is considered sustainable and represents a comparable payout ratio to that of its peer groups 
on november   the companies entered into an agreement with mli and certain of its affiliates to settle the feit 
under the agreement  realty agreed to grant a mortgage of the santa anita racetrack to merrill lynch and repay merrill lynch approximately of the feit in cash generated in part from the sale of certain assets 
it is anticipated that the remaining feit will be discharged from the proceeds of the sale of equity securities of the companies which  if offered publicly will be offered pursuant to a prospectus 
merrill lynch agreed  subject to the terms of the settlement agreement  not to sell any shares of the existing feit until february  while the companies complete the sale of equity securities and certain assets 
on august   abraham d 
gosman resigned his position as director and chairman of the boards of directors of the companies and chief executive officer and treasurer of operating 
in connection with his resignation  mr 
gosman is seeking severance payments and the companies are evaluating whether certain severance or other payments should be made to mr 
gosman 
as part of this evaluation  the companies are considering the applicability of mr 
gosman s employment contract and whether such severance or other payments are appropriate 
the results of the companies evaluation are currently uncertain and depending upon the results of this evaluation and the results of ongoing discussions with mr 
gosman  mr 
gosman may initiate litigation against the companies 
the ultimate outcome of this matter is not predictable and management is not able to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the companies results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period 
however  the companies believe any such claim  even if materially adverse to the companies results of operations  should not have a material adverse effect on the companies financial position 
newly issued accounting standards financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   although early application is encouraged 
sfas requires that all derivative investments be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or comprehensive income depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is the type of hedge transactions 
the companies anticipate that due to its limited use of derivative instruments the adoption of sfas implementation will not have a material effect on the financial statements 
year the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of this year problem is due to the fact that many existing computer programs and embedded chip technology systems were developed using only the last two digits to indicate a year 
thus  such systems may not have the capability of recognizing a year that begins with as opposed to as a consequence  these systems could fail altogether  or produce erroneous results 
the companies state of readiness 
the companies have developed a five phase plan to address their year issues their year plan 
the five phases are i awareness  ii assessment  iii remediation  iv testing and v implementation 
awareness 
the companies have implemented a program to insure the relevant employees are aware of the year issue and have collected information from such employees regarding systems that might be affected 
management has assembled a year steering committee to determine and assess the risks of the year issue  plan and implement necessary upgrades or changes to make the companies year compliant or institute mitigating actions to minimize those risks and oversee the companies progress with respect to the implementation of their year plan 
assessment 
the companies have substantially completed an assessment of their internally and externally developed computer information systems 
operating is in the process of obtaining written verification from vendors to the effect that externally developed computer information systems acquired from such vendors correctly distinguish dates before the year operating expects to obtain such verifications  or a commitment from the relevant vendors to provide a solution  by no later than the second quarter of in addition  the companies have engaged outside consultants to review the plan and assessment 
realty is in the process of obtaining written verification from its externally developed general ledger information system and payroll service provider to ensure that the system correctly distinguishes dates before the year the companies are currently evaluating and assessing their other electronic systems that include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  hvac  elevator  fire and safety systems  and expect that the assessment will be completed by the second quarter of the companies are aware that such systems contain embedded chips that are often difficult to identify and test and may require complete replacement because they cannot be repaired 
failure of the companies to identify or remediate any embedded chips either on an individual or aggregate basis on which significant business operations depend  such as phone systems  could have a material adverse impact on the companies business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent such issues impact property level systems the companies may be required to fund capital expenditures for upgraded equipment and software if necessary 
in addition to the companies systems and those of its vendors and suppliers  there exist others that could have a material impact on the companies businesses if not year compliant 
such systems could affect airline operations and other segments of the lodging and travel industries 
these systems are outside of the companies control and their compliance is not verifiable by the companies 
the companies primary financial service providers are its primary bank  credit card and payroll processors each of which will be required to provide written verification to the companies that they will be year compliant 
for the foregoing reasons  the companies do not believe that there is a significant risk related to the failure of vendors or third party service providers to prepare for the year  however  the costs and timing of third party year compliance is not within the companies control and no assurances can be given with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or the potential effects of any failure to comply 
remediation 
operating s primary uses of software systems are the hotel reservation and front desk system  accounting  payroll and human resources software 
upgrades to the hotel reservation system to address some year compliance issues were installed and implemented during the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of testing of various airline interfaces with the hotel reservation system was completed by december operating plans to implement a new hotel front desk system by the end of  for which it has assurance that it is year compliant 
operating is in the process of testing year compliant releases of existing accounting  payroll and human resource systems 
implementation of these year compliant upgrades is expected by the end of the second quarter of in addition  operating has engaged outside consultants to assist in this process with respect to certain year compliance efforts 
operating has received written verification from the vendors of accounting and payroll and human resource systems that the general releases currently available are year compliant 
testing 
to attempt to confirm that their computer systems are year compliant  the companies expect to perform limited testing of their computer information systems and their other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  however  unless year issues arise in the course of their limited testing  the companies will rely on the written verification received from each vendor of their computer systems that the relevant system is year compliant 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the computer systems on which the companies business relies will correctly distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year any such failures could have a material adverse effect on the companies business  financial condition and results of operations 
the companies currently anticipate that testing will commence no later than the first quarter of and expect that their testing will be complete by the end of the third quarter of implementation 
the companies have begun implementation of year compliant software and software upgrades and expect to have them completed by december  costs to address the companies year issues 
based on current information from their review to date  the companies budgeted  for the cost of repairing  updating and replacing their standard computer information systems 
the companies anticipate that the primary cost of year compliance will be the cost of consultants and payroll and related expenses 
the companies currently expect that the installation of above mentioned upgrades and software will cost approximately  and as of the end of fiscal year  the companies have spent approximately  in connection therewith 
in addition  the companies expect that they will spend approximately  to address other year related issues  including upgrades of certain systems with embedded technology 
because the companies year assessment is ongoing and additional funds may be required as a result of future findings  the companies are not currently able to estimate the final aggregate cost of addressing the year issue 
while these efforts will involve additional costs  the companies believe  based on available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on their business  financial condition or results of operations 
the companies expect to fund the costs of addressing the year issue from cash flows resulting from operations 
while the companies believe that they will be year compliant by december   if these efforts are not completed on time  or if the costs associated with updating or replacing the companies computer systems exceed the companies estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the companies business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks presented by year issues 
the companies are still in the process of evaluating potential disruptions or complications that might result from year related problems  however  at this time the companies have not identified any specific business functions that will suffer material disruption as a result of year related events 
it is possible  however  that the companies may identify business functions in the future that are specifically at risk of year disruption 
the absence of any such determination at this point represents only the companies current status of evaluating potential year related problems and facts presently known to the companies  and should not be construed to mean that there is no risk of year related disruption 
moreover  due to the unique and pervasive nature of the year issue  it is impracticable to anticipate each of the wide variety of year events  particularly outside of the companies  that might arise in a worst case scenario which might have a material adverse impact on the companies business  financial condition and results of operations 
the companies contingency plans 
the companies intend to develop contingency plans for significant business risks that might result from year related events 
because the companies have not identified any specific business function that will be materially at risk of significant year related disruptions  and because a full assessment of the companies risk from potential year failures is still in process  the companies have not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year problems 
development of these contingency plans is currently scheduled to occur by the second quarter of and as otherwise appropriate 
as a part of their contingency planning  the companies are analyzing the most reasonably likely worst case scenario that could result from year related failures 
failures by third parties to achieve year compliance might result in short term disruptions in travel patterns  and potential temporary disruptions in the supply of utility  telecommunications and financial services  most likely regional or local in scope 
these events could cause temporary disruptions in the operations of hotel properties  and or lead travelers to postpone travel  or to cancel travel plans  thereby affecting lodging patterns and occupancy 
the preceding year readiness disclosure contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements represent the companies beliefs or expectations regarding future events 
all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results 
factors that may cause these differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  and the actions of governmental agencies or other third parties with respect to year problems 
seasonality the lodging industry is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue  profit margins and net earnings 
in addition  opening of new construction hotels and or timing of hotel acquisitions may cause variation of revenue from quarter to quarter 
certain factors you should consider presented below are certain factors that you should consider with respect to investing in the companies securities 
with respect to investing in the companies securities  you should be aware that there are various risks  including those described below  which may materially impact your investment in the companies securities or may in the future  and  in some cases  already do  materially affect us and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
you should consider carefully these risk factors with respect to investing in our securities 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements  you should read the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements discussed on page tax risks related to real estate investment trusts dependence on qualification as a reit  general 
realty operates and intends to operate in the future so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 
however  there is no assurance that realty has satisfied the requirements for reit qualification in the past or will qualify as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions is greater in the case of a paired share reit such as realty 
qualification as a reit also involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within realty s control 
in addition  realty s ability to qualify as a reit is dependent upon its continued exemption from the anti pairing rules of section b a of the code  which would ordinarily prevent realty from qualifying as a reit 
subject to the discussion below of recent legislation  the grandfathering rules governing section b generally provide  however  that section b a does not apply to a paired share reit if the reit and its paired operating company were paired on june  on june   realty which was then known as santa anita realty enterprises  inc santa anita realty was paired with the operating company which was then known as santa anita operating company saoc  and together with santa anita realty  santa anita 
there are  however  no judicial or administrative authorities interpreting this grandfathering rule 
moreover  if for any reason realty failed to qualify as a reit in  the benefit of the grandfathering rule would not be available to realty  in which case realty would not qualify as a reit for any taxable year from and after failure of realty to qualify as a reit would have a material adverse effect on the companies and their ability to make distributions to their shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
legislation  as well as regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions  also could change the tax law with respect to realty s qualification as a reit and the federal income tax consequence of such qualification 
see recent legislation may curb use of paired share structure below 
such legislation  regulations or administrative interpretations or court decisions could have a material adverse effect on the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
in addition  this legislation prevents the companies from growing as originally intended at the time of the santa anita mergers as defined below 
if realty were to fail to qualify as a reit  it would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates 
failure to qualify as a reit would result in additional tax liability to realty for the year or years involved 
in addition  the failure to qualify as a reit would also constitute a default under certain debt obligations of realty  which would generally allow the holders thereof to demand the immediate repayment of such indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
recent legislation curbs use of paired share structure 
on july   the president signed into law the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act 
included in the reform act is a freeze on the grandfathered status of paired share reits such as the companies 
under this legislation  the anti pairing rules provided in the code apply to real property interests acquired after march  by the companies  or by a subsidiary or partnership in which a ten percent or greater interest is owned by the companies  unless the real property interests are acquired pursuant to a written agreement that was binding on march  and at all times thereafter or the acquisition of such real property interests was described in a public announcement or in a filing with the sec on or before march  the restrictions on the activities of a grandfathered reit provided in the reform act may in the future make it impractical or undesirable for the companies to continue to maintain their paired share structure 
restructuring the operations of realty and operating to comply with the rules provided by the reform act could cause the companies to incur tax liabilities  to recognize an impairment loss on their goodwill assets  or otherwise materially adversely affect the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
adverse effects of reit minimum distribution requirements 
in order to qualify as a reit realty is generally required each year to distribute to its shareholders at least of its taxable income excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  if realty were to dispose of assets acquired in certain acquisitions during the ten year period following the acquisition  realty would be required to distribute at least of the amount of any built in gain attributable to such assets that realty recognizes in the disposition  less the amount of any tax paid with respect to such recognized built in gain 
realty generally is subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions paid by it with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of i of its ordinary income for that year  ii of its capital gain net income for that year  and iii of its undistributed income from prior years 
risks related to the implementation and effects of the comprehensive restructuring plan we believe that the successful implementation of the comprehensive restructuring plan  which includes pursuing the separation of the companies healthcare and lodging businesses  is in the best long term interests of the companies and their stockholders 
however  there are a number of potentially negative or adverse factors that you should be aware of in connection with both the implementation of the comprehensive restructuring plan  as well as the effects of the comprehensive restructuring plan 
implementation 
the comprehensive restructuring plan involves a number of component parts that require a substantial commitment of our resources to implement 
in order to successfully implement each part of the comprehensive restructuring plan  a significant amount of the available time and effort of the management of the meditrust companies must be utilized 
for example  each transaction involving the sale of a non strategic asset requires that the personnel who oversee that asset or group of assets not only continue to operate or monitor that asset consistent with past practice  but also that they prepare it for sale  meet with potential buyers  negotiate  and or assist in the negotiation with the ultimate buyer 
in addition  the meditrust companies have expended  and will continue to expend significant financial resources to implement the comprehensive restructuring plan 
each transaction of the type described above generally involves the payment of fees and expenses of outside professionals  including investment bankers  attorneys  independent accountants and consultants 
our ability to successfully implement the comprehensive restructuring plan is also impacted by external factors  such as i the performance of the economy generally and real estate markets in particular  ii the ability of the meditrust companies to access the capital markets  iii changes in applicable law and iv the identification of satisfactory buyers of non strategic assets 
after the spin off  each of the lodging and health care business segments will need to separately access the capital markets to the extent that additional capital is required 
however  we can not be certain that the capital markets  will be amenable to the spin off and the creation of the two distinct  separately traded entities 
in addition  changes in the capital markets  which are beyond our control  may materially impact our ability to successfully implement the spin off  as well as other component parts of the comprehensive restructuring plan 
effects the structure of the meditrust companies will be significantly altered from our structure today and from our structure six months ago 
today  each holder of paired shares of the meditrust companies owns interests in a combined business which owns and invests in health care properties  owns and operates lodging properties and owns and operates golf related properties 
until recently  the meditrust companies also owned and operated a horse racing facility and related property 
after completion of the comprehensive restructuring plan  and assuming a shareholder continues to hold the securities issued to the shareholders in the spin off  shareholders will own an equity interest in a lodging business and in a separate health care financing business 
the lodging business and the health care financing business will be operated independently  they will be financed separately and their securities will be traded independently on the new york stock exchange 
a shareholder will no longer hold an interest in either the horse racing or golfing businesses as these businesses have been  or will be sold 
on february   the companies entered into a definitive agreement to sell the subsidiaries that conduct the golf businesses at the golf courses owned and leased by realty together with the golf course related real estate owned and or leased by realty  to golf acquisitions  llc  an affiliate of clubcorp  inc the transaction  which is subject to customary closing conditions  is scheduled to close on or prior to march  in addition  the health care financing business will be somewhat smaller than it has been historically  as certain non strategic assets  most of which relate to the health care business  have been sold and the funding of new health care investments has been reduced as part of our reduction of capital expenditures 
substantial leverage risks realty has substantial leverage 
in that regard  on july   realty entered into the credit agreement  which provides realty with up to billion in credit facilities 
the degree of leverage of realty could have important consequences to investors  including the following i realty s ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired  both currently and in the future  ii a substantial portion of realty s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to realty for other purposes  iii as described below  certain of realty s borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which will expose realty to the risk of increased interest rates  iv realty may be substantially more leveraged than certain of its competitors  which may place realty at a competitive disadvantage  and v realty s substantial degree of leverage may limit its flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions  reduce its ability to withstand competitive pressures and make it more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business 
the foregoing risks associated with the debt obligations of the companies may adversely affect the market price of securities issued by the companies and may inhibit the ability of the companies to raise capital in both the public and private markets 
health care industry risks operating risks 
one of realty s primary businesses is that of buying  selling  financing and leasing health care related properties 
the risks of this business include  among other things competition for tenants  competition from other health care financing providers  a number of which may have greater marketing  financial and other resources and experience than realty  changes in government regulation of health care  changes in the availability and cost of insurance coverage  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing  and adverse effects of general and local economic conditions 
concentration of company operators in long term care industry 
the long term care businesses of the third party operators of realty s health care related real estate  and the health care industry generally  are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation governing the licensing and conduct of operations at health care facilities  certain capital expenditures  the quality of services provided  the manner in which the services are provided  financial and other arrangements between health care providers and reimbursement for services rendered 
the failure of any third party operator to comply with such laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect its ability to operate the facility or facilities and could adversely affect such operator s ability to make payments to realty  thereby adversely affecting the companies 
concentration of credit risks  reliance on major operators 
as of december   long term care facilities comprised of realty s real estate investments and realty s investments in facilities of its two largest health care operators totaled approximately of realty s total real estate investments 
such a concentration in specific types of facilities  as well as in these operators  could have a material adverse effect on the companies 
realty s third party operators manage long term care facilities on each of realty s properties 
the financial position of realty may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of such operators  or any other major operator of realty  including a bankruptcy  insolvency or general downturn in the business of any such operator  or in the event any such operator does not renew its leases as they expire and realty can not lease these facilities to other operators on comparable terms 
government regulation may increase 
the health care industry is subject to changing political  economic  regulatory and demographic influences that may affect the operations of health care facilities and providers 
during the past several years  the health care industry has been subject to changes in government regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
some elected officials have announced that they intend to examine certain aspects of the united states health care system including proposals which may further increase governmental involvement in health care 
for example  the president and congress have in the past  and may in the future  propose health care reforms which could impose additional regulations on realty and its operators including operating or limit the amounts that operators may charge for services 
realty s operators of its health care facilities are and will continue to be subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by health or social service agencies and other regulatory authorities in the various states and localities in which they operate or in which they will operate 
health care reform 
the balanced budget act of  which was signed by the president on august  the act  enacted significant changes to the medicare and medicaid programs designed to modernize payment and health care delivery systems while achieving substantial budgetary savings 
in seeking to limit medicare reimbursement for long term care services  the act mandated the establishment of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities to replace the current cost based reimbursement system 
the cost based system reimburses skilled nursing facilities for reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in providing routine services as well as capital costs and ancillary costs  subject to limits fixed for the particular geographic area served by the skilled nursing facility 
under the prospective payment system  skilled nursing facilities will be paid a federal per diem rate for covered services 
the per diem payment will cover routine service  ancillary  and capital related costs 
the prospective payment system will be phased in over a four year period beginning on or after july  under provisions of the act  states will be provided additional flexibility in managing their medicaid program 
among other things  the act repealed a federal law s payment standard  which had required states to pay reasonable and adequate payments to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated hospitals  nursing facilities and certain intermediate care facilities 
these health care reforms may reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care  which could adversely affect the revenues of realty s third party borrowers and lessees and thereby adversely affect those borrowers and lessees abilities to make their loan or lease payments to realty 
failure of the borrowers or lessees to make their loan or lease payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on the companies 
reliance on third party payors  availability of reimbursement 
the cost of many of the services offered by the current operators of realty s health care facilities are reimbursed or paid for by third party payors such as medicare and medicaid programs for elderly  low income and disabled patients and state medicaid programs for managed care organizations 
no assurance can be given that third party reimbursement for realty s operators will continue to be available or when reimbursement will be offered or that reimbursement rates will not be reduced 
the increase in the number of providers contracting to provide per person fixed cost health care to a patient population has increased pressure on third party payors to lower costs 
a significant portion of the revenue from the third party operators who lease or receive financing from realty is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
these programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
in recent years  there have been fundamental changes in the medicare program which have resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of health care services 
moreover  health care facilities have experienced increasing pressures from private payers such as health maintenance organizations attempting to control health care costs 
reimbursement from private payers has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payers 
concern regarding health care costs may result in significant reductions in payment to health care facilities  and there can be no assurance that future payment rates from either governmental or private health care plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients 
in many instances  revenues from medicaid programs are already insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could adversely affect revenues from the third party operators who lease or receive financing from realty and thereby adversely affect those entities ability to make their lease or loan payments to realty 
failure of these entities to make their lease or loan payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on the company 
fraud and abuse enforcement 
in the past several years  due to rising health care costs  there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
payment of any remuneration to induce the referral of medicare and medicaid patients is generally prohibited by federal and state statutes 
both federal and state self referral statutes severely restrict the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest 
the act provided the federal government with expanded enforcement powers to combat waste  fraud and abuse in the delivery of health care services 
in addition  the office of inspector general and the health care financing administration now have increased investigation and enforcement activity of fraud and abuse  specifically targeting nursing homes  home health providers and medical equipment suppliers 
failure to comply with the foregoing fraud and abuse laws or government program integrity regulations may result in sanctions including the loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs including medicare and medicaid  asset forfeitures and civil and criminal penalties 
it is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and informant activity in the area of fraud and abuse  as well as self referral  will continue in future years 
in the event that any borrower or lessee were to be found in violation of the applicable laws regarding fraud  abuse or self referral  that borrower s or lessee s license or certification to participate in government reimbursement programs could be jeopardized  or that borrower or lessee could be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties 
either of these occurrences could have a material adverse affect on the companies by adversely affecting the borrower s or lessee s ability to make debt or lease payments to realty 
the foregoing factors could adversely affect the ability of the operators of realty s health care facilities to generate revenues and make payments to realty 
this  in turn  could materially adversely affect the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
lodging industry risks the companies  through their acquisition of la quinta  have made a significant investment in hotels and related lodging facilities 
la quinta is operated by a subsidiary of operating and its real estate assets are owned by realty or a subsidiary of realty 
competition 
the results of operations of la quinta hotels are subject to general economic conditions  competition  the desirability of particular locations  the relationship between supply of and demand for hotel rooms and other factors 
la quinta hotels generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors  including wide range of lodging facilities offering full service  limited service and all suite lodging options to the public 
the continued success of la quinta s hotels will be dependent  in large part  upon their ability to compete in such areas as reasonableness of room rates  quality of accommodations  name recognition  service level and convenience of locations 
additionally  an increasing supply of hotel rooms in la quinta s market segment and recent consolidations in the lodging industry generally resulting in the creation of several large  multi branded hotel chains with diversified operations may adversely impact la quinta s financial condition  results of operations and business 
no assurance can be given that demographic  geographic or other changes in markets will not adversely affect the convenience or desirability of the locations of la quinta s hotels 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that  in the markets in which la quinta s hotels operate  competing hotels will not provide greater competition for guests than currently exists  and that new hotels will not enter such markets 
geographic concentration 
la quinta s hotels are concentrated in the western and southern regions of the united states 
as a result  la quinta is sensitive to economic and competitive conditions in those regions 
extensive employment and other governmental regulations 
the hotel business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulatory requirements  including building and zoning requirements  all of which can prevent  delay  make uneconomical or significantly increase the cost of developing additional lodging facilities 
in addition  la quinta s hotels and operating are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions  work permit requirements and discrimination claims 
an increase in the minimum wage rate  employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could adversely affect the companies 
fluctuations in operating results 
the lodging industry may be adversely affected by  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes in local market conditions  oversupply of hotel space  a reduction in demand for hotel space in specific areas  changes in travel patterns  weather conditions  changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages  prices or construction costs  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing for operating or capital needs  and changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses 
room supply and demand historically have been sensitive to shifts in gross domestic product growth  which has resulted in cyclical changes in average daily room and occupancy rates 
due in part to the strong correlation between the lodging industry s performance and economic conditions  the lodging industry is subject to cyclical changes in revenues 
in that regard  there can be no assurance that the recent strength in the lodging industry generally  or in the segment of the industry in which la quinta operates  will not decline in the future 
furthermore  the lodging industry is seasonal in nature  with revenues typically higher in summer periods than in winter periods 
construction 
if realty resumes la quinta s historical strategy of growing through new construction  realty may from time to time experience shortages of materials or qualified tradespeople or volatile increases in the cost of certain construction materials or labor  resulting in longer than normal construction and remodeling periods  loss of revenue and increased costs 
realty will rely heavily on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized or understaffed 
the inability or failure of one or more local contractors to perform may result in construction or remodeling delays  increased cost and loss of revenue 
the foregoing factors could adversely affect la quinta s operations which  in turn  could materially adversely affect the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
real estate investment risks general risks 
realty s investments will be subject to the risks inherent in owning real estate 
the underlying value of realty s real estate investments and the companies results of operations and ability to make distributions to their shareholders and pay amounts due on their indebtedness will depend on the ability of the lessees  the operators and operating to operate realty s properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient revenues in excess of operating expenses to make rent payments under their leases or loan payments in respect of their loans from realty 
results of operations of realty s properties may also be adversely affected by  among other things o changes in national economic conditions  changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  o changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of financing  o the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws and other regulatory requirements  o the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  o changes in real estate tax rates and assessments and other operating expenses  o adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies  o adverse changes in zoning and other land use laws  and o civil unrest  earthquakes and other natural disasters which may result in uninsured losses and other factors which are beyond its control 
dependence on rental income from real property 
realty s cash flow  results of operations and value of its assets would be adversely affected if a significant number of third party operators of the realty s properties fail to meet their lease obligations 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major operator may have an adverse effect on a property 
at any time  an operator also may seek protection under the bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of such operator s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the cash flow of the property 
if an operator rejects its lease  the owner s claim for breach of the lease would absent collateral securing the claim be treated as a general unsecured claim 
generally  the amount of the claim would be capped at the amount owed for unpaid pre petition lease payments unrelated to the rejection  plus the greater of one year s lease payments or of the remaining lease payments payable under the lease but not to exceed the amount of three years lease payments 
environmental matters 
the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation  may affect the operating costs of realty and operating 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on or under the property 
environmental laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not such substances originated from the property 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remediate such property properly  may adversely affect realty s ability to borrow by using such real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials  including asbestos containing materials or acms  into the environment 
in addition  third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released acms or other hazardous materials 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the use or transfer of property  and these restrictions may require expenditures 
in connection with the ownership and operation of any of realty s properties  realty  operating and the other lessees or operators of these properties may be liable for any such costs 
the cost of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could materially adversely affect the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
compliance with the ada may affect expected distributions to the companies shareholders 
under the americans with disabilities act of the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
a determination that realty or operating is not in compliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines and or an award of damages to private litigants 
if realty or operating were required to make modifications to comply with the ada  there could be a material adverse effect on the companies and their ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on their indebtedness 
uninsured and underinsured losses 
each of realty s leases and mortgage loans typically specifies that comprehensive insurance is to be maintained on each of the applicable properties  including liability  fire and extended coverage 
leases and loan documents for new investments including those leased to operating typically contain similar provisions 
however  there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes and floods  that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
realty will use its discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on the investments of realty and operating at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
this may result in insurance coverage that  in the event of a substantial loss  would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the lost investment and also may result in certain losses being totally uninsured 
inflation  changes in building codes  zoning or other land use ordinances  environmental considerations  lender imposed restrictions and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds  if any  received by realty or operating might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to such property 
real estate financing risks financing and maturities 
realty is subject to the normal risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing  including the risk that realty s cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and dividends  the risk that indebtedness on its properties  or unsecured indebtedness  will not be able to be renewed  repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of such indebtedness 
if realty were unable to refinance the indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  realty might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to realty  which losses could have a material adverse effect on realty and its ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on its indebtedness 
furthermore  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and realty is unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies  all with a consequent loss of revenues and asset value to realty 
foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  thereby hindering realty s ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 
risk of rising interest rates 
realty has incurred and expects in the future to incur indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would increase realty s interest costs to the extent that the related indebtedness was not protected by interest rate protection arrangements  which could have a material adverse effect on realty and its ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on its indebtedness or cause realty to be in default under certain debt instruments including its debt securities 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of the shares to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by the companies  which could adversely affect the market price for the shares and could also adversely affect the market price of any preferred stock issued by either of the companies
