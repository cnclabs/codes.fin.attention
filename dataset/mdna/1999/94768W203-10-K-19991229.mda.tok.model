services revenue from customer maintenance fees for postcontract support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically months 
when customer maintenance fees are included in an initial software license fee  the company allocates approximately of the software license fee to the first year s maintenance 
the amount allocated to customer maintenance fees for the first year is comparable to customer maintenance fees charged separately by the company

product revenue was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of from fiscal to fiscal protracted sales cycles resulting from the transition to an internet intranet product line  the introduction in the market of competitive internet based and outsourced solutions  a general stagnation in sales of client server software solutions  and year and other information technology constraints were the primary contributors to the decrease in fiscal the increase in product revenue in fiscal resulted largely from an increase in the number of seats associated with shipments to both new and existing customers as well as an increase in the average price per seat 
because the company s product revenue consists of a small number of large dollar transactions  wide fluctuations can be experienced from period to period 
such fluctuations are not necessarily indicative of future results 
services revenue 
services revenue enterprise was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal services revenue internet increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal services revenue internet increased to  for fiscal from for fiscal continued growth of the webhire recruiter customer base in the internet segment and the additional revenue stream introduced with webhire jobpost account for the increases realized

cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue includes royalty payments for third party software embedded in the company s products and costs of documentation and shipping 
cost of product revenue was  and of product revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage increase for fiscal is due primarily to increased royalties due under third party licensing arrangements for the webhire enterprise product

cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue includes all costs of maintaining the client services organization and the internet and transaction based solutions segment operations  including salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services  facilities cost and  to a lessor extent  third party scanning services and royalty payments for software maintenance 
cost of services revenue enterprise decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal cost of services revenue enterprise increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the reduction in fiscal is due to management s cost containment measures 
the increase in fiscal is principally attributable to increased personnel and associated costs to support a larger client base and proportionately higher services revenue 
cost of services revenue internet increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal cost of services revenue internet increased to  for fiscal from for fiscal the increases in absolute dollars for both periods are principally attributable to costs associated with supporting the expanding webhire recruiter customer base and  for the fiscal period  the introduction of webhire jobpost 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses include all costs associated with the product engineering and quality functions  including salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services and facilities costs 
research and development expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the increases in absolute dollars for the years presented are primarily due to increases in both personnel and consulting expenses in support of the company s new and existing product development initiatives and its quality assurance programs 
the internet and transaction based solutions segment accounted for  and of total research and development expenses in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expenses will vary from period to period as a percentage of total revenue dependent upon the stage in product development and the requisite investment funding of ongoing projects 
the company considers continued investment in research and development to be integral to its future success 
all of the company s research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include promotional costs and trade shows and costs associated with personnel involved in sales and marketing functions  including salaries  commissions and other personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to the increase in sales costs associated with the ramping up of the internet sales organization and webhire jobpost  introduced in the first quarter of fiscal there were employees in the internet sales organization as of september  as compared to at the end of the previous year 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to increased commissions expense resulting from the increase in revenue and to the sales and marketing costs associated with webhire recruiter  introduced in the first quarter of fiscal the company expects that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and will vary from year to year as a percentage of total revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of costs for corporate operations personnel executive  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  legal and administrative  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the absolute dollar increases for both periods are primarily the result of personnel increases and investments in systems in support of the internet operations 
increased accounts receivable reserves also contributed to the fiscal increase 
amortization of acquired technologies during fiscal  the company acquired certain technologies in connection with an asset purchase from amazon 
com and the acquisition of hireworks  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the investments in these technologies are being amortized over a two year life from the respective transaction dates 
other income  net other income was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the variances from period to period are due to fluctuations in the average combined cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investment balances 
the company expects to continue to yield investment income on its average balance of combined cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments at an average rate comparable to that experienced for fiscal benefit provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was   for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the changes in the effective tax rate for both fiscal as compared to fiscal and for fiscal as compared to fiscal relate principally to the generation of income or losses from operations during the respective periods 
liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments of  an increase of  from  at september  working capital was  at september  as compared to  at september   an increase of  cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended september  cash used in operating activities consisted mainly of the net loss for the fiscal year of  partially offset by the effects of depreciation and amortization of  and of fluctuations in certain assets and liabilities 
cash used in investing activities was  during the year ended september  cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of purchases of technologies aggregating  and of property and equipment of  primarily computer equipment partially offset by the net proceeds of  from short and long term investment activity 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was  consisting principally of the net proceeds from the softbank stock issuance of  which was consummated on september  to date  the company has not invested in derivative securities or any other financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
cash has been  and the company contemplates that it will continue to be  invested in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
from time to time  the company may evaluate potential acquisitions of products  businesses and technologies that may complement or expand the company s business 
any such transactions consummated may use a portion of the company s working capital and or require the issuance of equity or debt 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balance will be sufficient to meet its working capital expenditure requirements through fiscal because operating and investing activities are expected to use cash in the near term  any future growth will more likely than not require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
impact of year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the following paragraphs in this section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company has attempted to make an assessment with regard to whether its own internal information systems are year compliant 
in particular  the company has upgraded its accounting excluding payroll and customer management systems with systems that are warranted by the vendors to be year compliant 
in addition  the company plans to seek assurances from its existing vendors whose systems are not warranted to be year compliant that such systems are year compliant 
currently  the company does not anticipate purchasing additional systems 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for year projects 
although the company does not believe that any additional year compliance related costs will be significant  there can be no such assurance 
any failure of third party equipment or software comprising any part of the company s systems to operate properly with regard to year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to address associated problems 
the company has received assurances that all material embedded systems included in the company s products are year compliant 
the company believes  based on an internal assessment  that the current versions of its software products are year compliant 
the company limits its contractual warrantees on year compliance to objective performance standards that the company has tested  and the company makes no warrantees for nonconformance if the company s software products are combined with other software or data that are not conducive to accurately calculating  comparing or sequencing date and time data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company has no plan to ascertain whether the internal systems and products of its customers are year compliant 
although the company has not been involved in any litigation or proceeding to date involving its products or services related to year issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the company does not have any specific contingency plans if any year problems develop with respect to the company s embedded systems  systems acquired from vendors or systems used by third parties with whom the company has a mutual relationship 
contingency plans will be developed if it appears the company or its key vendors will not be year compliant  and such non compliance is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
year issues may affect the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers in a variety of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to replace or remedy their current hardware and software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company 
the company does not believe that there is any practical way to ascertain the extent of  and has no plan to address problems associated with such a reduction in purchasing resources of its customers 
any such reduction could  however  result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the year issue is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without significant additional costs 
factors affecting future operating results an investment in webhire s equity securities involves various risks 
current and prospective investors in webhire s securities should carefully consider the following risk factors 
these risk factors are not exhaustive and should be read together with the other reports and documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission  which may include additional or more current information that is important to an investment in webhire 
to compete effectively  we must adapt quickly to advances in technology and changes in customer requirements 
the market for automated recruiting products and services is undergoing rapid changes including continuing advances in technology and changes in customer requirements and preferences 
these market dynamics have been amplified by the emergence of the internet as a tool for recruiting solutions 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our software and services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings 
any failure on our part to quickly develop products and services that address changes in technology or customer demands will likely result in loss of market share to a competitor 
our business is dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
our success will depend  in large part  upon the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and timely development of enabling products  such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  greater frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may have to spend considerable resources to adapt our offerings accordingly 
furthermore  in the past  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays 
any future outages or delays could affect the internet sites on which our customers job advertisements are posted and the willingness of employers and job seekers to use our online recruitment offerings 
if any of these events occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
webhire has recently expanded its technology into several new business areas and cannot be certain that its expansion will be successful 
webhire has recently expanded its technology into products and services that can be offered over the internet to foster long term growth 
these areas are relatively new to webhire s product development  sales and marketing personnel and webhire cannot be assured that the markets for these products and services will develop or that it will be able to compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these new areas making webhire s success in this area difficult to predict 
the success of internet computing and  in particular  the company s current internet computing software products and services is difficult to predict because internet computing represents a method of computing that is new 
the success of internet computing will depend in large measure on i the lower cost of ownership of internet computing relative to client server architecture  ii the ease of use and administration relative to client server architecture  and iii how hardware and software vendors choose to compete in this market 
there can be no assurances that sufficient numbers of vendors will undertake this commitment  that the market will accept internet computing or that internet computing will generate significant revenues for the company 
our business model is unproven 
we began offering online subscriptions for webhire recruiter in fiscal product revenue from software sales are expected over a relatively short period of time to become a much smaller component of our revenue 
maintenance revenue associated with product sales will also decrease over time 
our long term business model and profit potential are unproven 
to be successful  we must develop and market online recruitment offerings that achieve broad market acceptance by employers  job seekers and interactive media companies 
it is possible that we will be required to further adapt our business model in response to additional changes in the online recruitment market or if our current business model is not successful 
if we are not able to anticipate changes in the online recruitment market or if our business model is not successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to continue to build customer awareness 
we believe that continuing to build brand recognition is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our online recruitment offerings 
brand recognition is a key differentiating factor among providers of online recruitment offerings and we believe it could become more important as competition in the online recruitment market increases 
we may find it necessary to accelerate expenditures on our sales and marketing efforts or otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness among potential customers 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur significant expenses in promoting our brand  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the growth in demand for automated recruiting software and services and the use of the internet as a recruiting medium are uncertain 
our future success is substantially dependent on broader recognition of the potential benefits of automated recruiting software and services and the growth in demand for these products and services 
it is difficult to assess the size of the market that will develop and the rate at which it will develop 
if the market does not develop as we anticipate  or if it develops more slowly than we expect  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
our future is highly dependent on a significant increase in the use of the internet as a recruiting medium 
the online recruitment market is new and rapidly evolving  and we cannot yet gauge its effectiveness as compared to traditional recruiting methods 
as a result  demand and market acceptance of online recruitment offerings are uncertain 
the adoption of online recruiting  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional methods of recruiting  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising for jobs 
we cannot assure you that the online recruitment market will continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if the online recruitment market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
our computer systems could fail or overload 
the success of our online recruitment offerings is highly dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems could damage or cause interruptions in these systems 
if our systems are affected by any of these occurrences  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our insurance policies may not cover  or if covered  may not adequately compensate us for  any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
we do not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
in addition  webhire must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
webhire 
com has in the past and may in the future experience slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers and other internet site operators for access to webhire 
com 
many of the internet service providers have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
if we experience any of these problems  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital as needed in the future  our business may be adversely affected 
we currently anticipate that our available cash will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal we may need to raise additional capital  however  to fund more rapid expansion to develop new and to enhance existing services to respond to competitive pressures  and to acquire complementary services  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage of ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced and such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on terms favorable to us  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our new product introductions may have defects which could result in adverse publicity or have other negative effects 
as the marketplace for recruiting solutions continues to evolve  we plan to develop and introduce new products and services to enable us to effectively meet the changing needs of the market 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released 
in the past  despite prior testing  we have discovered software errors in some of our products after their introduction 
product defects may result in adverse publicity  loss of or delay in market acceptance  injury to our reputation and brand awareness  or claims against us  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources 
the market for recruitment solutions is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
we compete with companies that offer a single database job board solution  such as monster 
com and career mosaic  as well as newspapers  magazines and other traditional media companies that provide online job search services  such as careerpath 
com 
we also compete with other large internet information portals  such as aol 
com 
in addition  we compete with traditional recruiting services  such as newspapers and employee recruiting agencies that provide or source full time  contract or temporary labor  for a share of employers total recruiting budgets 
we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies  including print media companies and employee recruiting agencies with established brands  enter the online recruitment market 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions 
we believe that there will be rapid business consolidation in the online recruitment industry 
accordingly  new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  new technologies will likely increase the competitive pressures that we face 
the development of competing technologies by market participants or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions  render our existing software and services obsolete or unmarketable and or result in loss of market share 
we must manage our growth in order to achieve desired results 
the evolution of our business and the expansion of our customer base has resulted in substantial growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations of the last few years 
our future results of operations will depend in part on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement our operational  customer support  and financial control systems and to expand  train  and manage our employee base 
the successful operation of our business depends in large part on our relationships with third parties 
a key element of our business strategy is to develop relationships with leading industry organizations in order to increase our market presence  expand distribution channels and broaden our product line 
we believe that our continued success depends in large part on our ability to maintain such relationships and cultivate additional relationships 
there can be no assurance that our existing strategic partners will not discontinue their relationships with us  or that we will be able to successfully develop additional strategic relationships 
in addition  certain technology incorporated in our software is licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis 
the termination of any of these licenses  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delay in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
in addition  any required replacement licenses could prove more costly than our current license relationships and might not provide technology as powerful and functional as the third party technology we currently license 
also  any such delay  to the extent it becomes extended or occurs at or near the end of a fiscal quarter  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that quarter 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of our products or relating to current or future technologies  we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our operating results may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
our results of operations have been  and may in the future be  subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
such fluctuations could be due to a variety of factors  including the following the fact that our product revenue consists of a relatively small number of large dollar transactions and  as a result  may fluctuate significantly from one quarter to another if the number of transactions completed varies slightly  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the capital spending patterns of our customers  our sales incentive strategy which is based in part on annual sales targets  the fact that a substantial portion of our product revenue often occurs during the last few weeks of each quarter and  as a result  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  and our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
to the extent our level of revenue in the future decreases from past levels or in some future quarter our revenue or operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors  our profitability and the price of our common stock is likely to be materially and adversely affected 
one large stockholder beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding stock  is represented on our board of directors and has rights to participate in certain webhire transactions such stockholder s interests could conflict with yours and significant sales of stock held by it could have a negative effect on our stock price 
softbank beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  yahoo inc  of which softbank owns approximately  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of their stock ownership  softbank and its affiliate have significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  and their interests could conflict with those of other stockholders 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of webhire 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by these entities  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
softbank has the right to nominate two members of our board of directors  which currently consists of an aggregate of members one of whom is a softbank representative  and so long as it continues to hold of our outstanding common stock  it is entitled to nominate one director each time a class of directors in which one of its representatives serves is subject to election 
further  one of softbank s directors is entitled to serve as a member of the board s audit and compensation committees 
as a result of softbank s board representation  it has significant influence in all webhire matters requiring board approval 
in addition  in the event we propose to enter into a joint venture for operations in the united kingdom  continental europe or japan or a business transaction with any competitor of softbank s affiliate zdnet  we are required by the terms of the stock purchase agreement pursuant to which softbank acquired our common stock to offer softbank or one of its affiliates the opportunity to participate in the transaction on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to us and them 
as a result of these requirements  potential third parties may be reluctant to negotiate joint ventures or business transactions with us because they know softbank and its affiliates will be given the opportunity to participate in such transactions 
we depend on key personnel who may not continue to work for us 
our future success depends to a significant extent on our senior management and other key employees  many of whom have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our operations 
as a result  if any of these individuals were to leave webhire  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional key employees 
competition for qualified personnel in the high tech industry is intense 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel  or retaining and motivating existing personnel  our business will be adversely affected 
our stock price may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price 
we cannot predict the extent to which investors interest in us will lead to a stable trading market or how liquid the market might become 
the stock market in general and the market prices of shares in technology companies  particularly those such as ours that offer internet based products and services  have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
the market price of our common stock could be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors  including the following quarterly variations in our results of operations  adverse business developments impacting webhire  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  investor perception of webhire and online recruitment services in general  announcements by our competitors of new products and services  and fluctuations in our common stock price may affect our visibility and credibility in the online recruitment market 
in the event of broad fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  our stockholders may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price 
it is difficult to protect our intellectual property rights 
we regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success and rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect these rights 
we cannot be assured that the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
our inability to protect our proprietary rights would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to costly intellectual infringement claims 
as the number of products and services in our industry increases and these solutions further overlap  the likelihood that our current or future products may become subject to infringement claims increases 
there has been substantial litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights involving computer software companies 
any claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such claims or litigation may require us to obtain a license and or pay damages  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products and the incorporation of products from other companies may entail the risk of product liability claims 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to such claims 
for example  we limit our contractual warranties on year compliance to objective performance standards that we have tested  and we do not make any warranties for nonconformance if our software products are combined with other software or data that is not conducive to accurately calculating  comparing or sequencing date and time data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
there can be no guarantee  however  that such provisions will be effective in limiting our exposure 
a successful product liability action brought against us could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the year problem could affect our products  our internal information systems and or our customers 
products 
we believe  based on an internal assessment  that the current versions of our software products that are licensed to customers are year compliant 
in addition  we expect the software that is used in our service offerings is to be compliant by december  we also limit our contractual warranties on year compliance to objective performance standards that we have tested  and we make no warranties for nonconformance if our software products are combined with other software or data that are not conducive to accurately calculating  comparing or sequencing date and time data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
nonetheless  in the event that the current versions of our licensed software products are not year compliant  or that the software that is used in our service offerings is not year compliant  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to defend our products or services or negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
internal information systems 
we have attempted to make an assessment with regard to whether our own internal information systems are year compliant and have upgraded certain systems to make them year compliant 
in addition  we have sought assurances from our existing vendors whose systems are not warranted to be year compliant that such systems are year compliant 
to the extent any of our internal information systems fail to be year compliant  however  we may be required to incur unanticipated expenses to address associated problems 
customers 
year issues are affecting the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers in a variety of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to replace or remedy their current hardware and software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our software products 
we do not believe that there is any practical way to ascertain the extent of such a reduction in purchasing resources of our customers 
any such reduction could  however  have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
general 
the year issue is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without significant additional costs 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of webhire without further action by the stockholders any may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock
