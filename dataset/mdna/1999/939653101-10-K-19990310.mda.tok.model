the funds raised would be used to pay off any outstanding advances on writ s lines of credit and for new acquisitions and capital improvements

expansions additions and major renovations expansions additions increase the rentable area of a property 
during  writ commenced the  square foot addition at westpark drive 
this pre leased addition is expected to be completed in the third quarter of major renovations are improvements sufficient to increase the income otherwise achievable at a property 
during  writ commenced the renovation of the bradlee shopping center  which is also expected to be completed in see expansions and major renovations on page of this report for descriptions of these projects 
tenant improvements tenant improvements are costs associated with commercial lease transactions such as painting and carpeting 
during  writ s average tenant improvement costs per square foot of space leased were as follows office retail industrial the retail and industrial tenant improvement costs are substantially lower than office improvement costs because the improvements required in these property types are substantially less extensive than in offices 
writ s office tenant improvement costs are among the lowest in the industry for a number of reasons 
over of our office tenants renew their leases with writ  and renewing tenants generally require minimal tenant improvements 
however  lower tenant costs is one of the many benefits of our focus on leasing to smaller office tenants 
smaller office suites have limited configuration alternatives 
therefore  writ is often able to lease an existing suite with the only tenant improvements being new paint and carpet 
other capital improvements other capital improvements are those not included in the above categories 
these are also referred to as recurring capital improvements 
over time these costs will be reincurred to maintain a property s income and value 
in our residential properties  these include new appliances  flooring  cabinets  bathroom fixtures  and the like 
these improvements are made as needed upon vacancy of an apartment and averaged for the apartments turned over in writ also expensed an average of per apartment turnover for items  which do not have a long term life and are  therefore  not capitalized 
during  writ s capital improvement costs were as follows in thousands accretive capital improvements acquisition related  expansions and major renovations  tenant improvements  subtotal  other  total  management believes that writ has the liquidity and the capital resources necessary to meet all of its known obligations and to make additional property acquisitions and capital improvements when appropriate to enhance long term growth 
year general writ has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications and other systems using computer chips currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
when the century date occurs  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or it may not recognize the year at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause the systems to process critical financial and operations information incorrectly 
in  writ implemented a new financial reporting system 
this implementation was not done in response to year issues but in order to improve management information systems and reporting processes 
the new system is year compliant 
management has implemented a project to review the remaining operating systems  including building operations  internal operating systems and third party compliance to determine if there are any year issues related to such systems 
project writ s year project the project is divided into three major sections building operations  internal operating systems and external agents ie  tenants and third party suppliers 
the general phases common to each section are inventorying year items  assigning priorities to identified items  assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material to writ  repairing or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant  testing material items  and designing and implementing contingency and business continuation plans for each property location and corporate headquarters 
as of december   the inventory and priority assignment phases of each section of the project was completed 
as described below  writ management is in the process of assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material 
material items are those that writ s management believes have a risk involving the safety of individuals  damage to the environment or property or material financial loss 
the building operations section consists of the testing of key systems at the property locations  such as fire detection prevention  elevators  heating ventilation and air conditioning  telephone and utility services 
the assessment phase is on schedule and writ estimates that approximately of the activities relating to this phase were completed as of december  the process of replacing items that are not in compliance and the subsequent testing of these items is ongoing and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of there have not been any significant repairs or replacements related to this phase of the project 
contingency planning for this section is underway 
all building operations activities are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of the internal operating system section includes the assessment of existing hardware and software and  where applicable  the replacement of hardware software that is not year compliant 
the assessment phase is ongoing  and writ believes that all of its significant hardware and software is year compliant 
contingency planning for this section is expected to be completed by the second quarter of all internal operating systems activities are expected to be completed by the third quarter of the external agents section includes the process of identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers and customers at the direct interface level and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
evaluations of critical third parties were initiated in the fourth quarter of these evaluations will be followed by the development of contingency plans  which are scheduled in the first quarter of  with completion by the second quarter of costs writ has not had any material expenditures related to the year project as of december  the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to writ s financial position 
risks the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
material failures could materially and adversely affect writ s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of tenants and third party suppliers  writ is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on writ s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce writ s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material external agents 
writ s management believes that with the completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions should be reduced

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the only material market risk to which writ is exposed is interest rate risk 
writ s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to refinancing long term fixed rate obligations  the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and its variable rate lines of credit 
writ primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including acquisition of real estate properties  capital improvements and working capital needs 
in the past writ has used interest rate hedge agreements to hedge against rising interest rates in anticipation of refinancing or new debt issuance
