item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and the notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview the company s core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality  precision steel balls and rollers 
in  balls accounted for approximately of the company s net sales  while rollers accounted for the remaining 
although all of the company s net sales from through were exclusively to domestic customers  the company s international sales have increased significantly since then and represented approximately of net sales in see note of the notes to financial statements 
in  both domestic and international sales declined due to reduced demand in the united states and abroad 
significant factors in the company s growth since its founding include its displacement of captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and international bearing manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications 
from through  the percentage of high precision balls produced by the company for use in quiet bearing applications has increased from approximately to approximately of total net ball sales 
management believes that the company s sales growth since is due to its ability to capitalize on opportunities in overseas markets and provide precision balls at competitive prices  as well as its emphasis on product quality and customer service 
the sales decline in was due in large part to economic conditions in asia and south america and a decline in outsourcing by certain captive producers 
the company s sales in asia declined by approximately million dollars in further  the company was adversely affected by increased competition from asian based competitors who sought to reduce overcapacity

slightly offsetting these factors was a lower federal tax rate due to the shifting of sales to the irish facility which benefits from a corporate tax rate

in addition  the company increased the provision for income taxes due to the decrease in foreign sales as a percentage of total sales and the anticipated decrease in the level of tax benefit from the company s participation in a shared foreign sales corporation 
liquidity and capital resources in july  the company entered into a loan agreement with first american national bank first american that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million  which will expire june  amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured and bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor plus or the fed funds effective rate plus 
the loan agreement contains customary financial and operating restrictions on the company  including covenants restricting the company  without first american s consent  from incurring additional indebtedness from  or pledging any of its assets to  other lenders and from disposing of a substantial portion of its assets 
in addition  the company is prohibited from declaring any dividend if a default exists under the revolving credit facility at the time of  or would occur as a result of  such a declaration 
the loan agreement also prohibits sales of property outside of the ordinary course of business 
the loan agreement contains financial covenants with respect to the company  including a covenant that the company s earnings will not decrease in any year by more than fifty percent of earnings in the company s immediately preceding fiscal year 
the company  as of march   was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the company generally provide that payments are due within either or days following the date of shipment 
under the company s inventory management program  payments typically are due within days after the product is used by the customer 
the company has developed a presence in foreign markets  and to the extent foreign sales increase  management believes that the company s working capital requirements will increase as a result of longer payment terms provided to foreign customers 
the company s net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature 
however  as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales  seasonality has become a factor for the company in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of august 
in the fourth quarter of  upon the commencement of production in its kilkenny  ireland facility  the company began to bill and receive payment from some of its foreign customers in their own currency 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions 
nonetheless  as a result of these sales  the company s foreign exchange risk has increased 
various strategies to manage this risk are under development and implementation 
the company has considered and continues to consider implementing a hedging program  but has not done so 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the company to compete with internationally based competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales 
working capital  which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories  was million at december   as compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased slightly to at december  from at december  cash flow from operations decreased to during from million during during  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  primarily on maintenance of its machinery and equipment at all four of the company s facilities 
the company does not intend to increase capacity in the company intends to finance these activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility described above 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in on august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock  equaling of the company s issued and outstanding shares as of august  the company did not purchase any shares under this program during seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results the company s net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature 
however  as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales  seasonality has become a factor for the company in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of august 
for information concerning the company s quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  see note of the notes to financial statements 
inflation and changes in prices while the company s operations have not been affected by inflation during recent years  prices for steel and other raw materials purchased by the company are subject to change 
for example  during  due to an increase in worldwide demand for steel and the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  the company experienced an increase in the price of steel and some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of steel from its existing suppliers 
typically  the company s pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six months 
in an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in steel prices  the company has generally avoided the use of long term  fixed price contracts with its customers 
instead  the company typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
the company was able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the steel price increases by taking such measures 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution that this report and the annual report to stockholders contain  and future filings by the company  press releases and oral statements made by the company s authorized representatives may contain  forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the company s business  many of which are discussed elsewhere in this filing and in the company s prior filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following paragraphs discuss the risk factors that the company regards as the most significant  although the company wishes to caution that other factors that currently are not considered significant or that currently cannot be foreseen may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
industry risks 
the precision ball and roller industry is cyclical and tends to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production 
the company s sales could be negatively affected by adverse conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally 
competition 
the precision ball and roller market is highly competitive  and many of the ball and roller manufacturers in the market are larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company s competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality  and the company s ability to remain competitive will depend  among other things  on whether it is able  in a cost effective manner  to keep pace with such quality improvements 
in addition  the company competes with many of its customers that  in addition to producing bearings  also internally produce balls and rollers for sale to third parties 
the company also faces a risk that its customers will decide to produce balls and rollers internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the company 
raw material shortages 
because the balls and rollers manufactured by the company have highly specialized applications  their production requires the use of very particular types of steel 
due to quality constraints in the united states  the company obtains the vast majority of its steel from overseas suppliers 
steel shortages or transportation problems  particularly with respect to steel  could have a detrimental effect on the company s business 
risks associated with international trade 
because the company obtains a majority of its raw materials from overseas suppliers and sells to a large number of international customers  the company faces risks associated with i adverse foreign currency fluctuations  ii changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  iii the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions  iv the imposition of import or other charges or taxes  and v unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which the company s suppliers and customers are located 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began accepting payment in foreign currency from foreign customers 
in addition  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies may adversely affect the ability of the company to compete with its foreign based competitors for international as well as domestic sales to the extent payments are made in united states dollars 
dependence on major customers 
during  the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of its net sales 
sales to various us and foreign divisions of skf  which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers in the world  accounted for approximately of net sales in  and sales to fag accounted for approximately of net sales in there can be no assurance  however  that skf will not centralize purchasing decisions in the future 
none of the company s other customers accounted for more than of its net sales in  but sales to two of its customers each represented more than of the company s net sales 
the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four digits to identify a particular year 
without corrective action  programs with time sensitive software could potentially act as if a date ending in is the year rather than the year this could cause computer applications to create erroneous results or cause a system failure 
the company has conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both its information technology systems and non information technology systems to determine if there would be a year problem with these systems 
prior to that evaluation  however  the company had decided to upgrade its information technology systems 
the systems the company intends to install have been certified by the vendor to be year compliant 
the company also evaluated its non information technology systems and has received certification by the manufacturers of that equipment that they are year compliant 
the company expects that it will have implemented these system upgrades by mid the company has also developed contingency plans that it believes would permit it to continue operating without causing any material harm to the results of operations 
the company expects to spend approximately  to replace its information technology systems and train personnel 
as of december   the company had spent approximately  on this project 
the company has not made any significant additional expenditures in through march  on year matters  and overall its expenditures on this issue have not been material 
the company has assigned one employee to coordinate its year efforts  and has relied on existing personnel to evaluate its year readiness 
the company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials and a variety of goods and services 
among its most important suppliers are those that provide the steel necessary to make quality balls and rollers 
the company has obtained written representation from approximately percent of its suppliers that their systems are year compliant 
the company believes that these representations and its own review of its systems will ensure that it will not be materially affected by the year issue 
so far  no supplier or vendor has indicated that the year issue will affect its ability to provide goods and services to the company 
despite these assurances  if the company s suppliers are unable to meet its needs  there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity and financial condition of the company 
the company believes it is taking the necessary steps to resolve the year issue in a comprehensive and timely manner 
nonetheless  should any unforeseen circumstance arise that would delay the replacement of its system  the company s ability to manufacture and ship its products  take orders  invoice customers  and collect payment could be adversely affected 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition to a degree the company has not determined 
the euro the treaty on european union provided that an economic and monetary union be established in europe whereby a single european currency  the euro  was introduced to replace the currencies of participating member states 
the euro was introduced on january   at which time the value of participating member state currencies were irrevocably fixed against the euro and the european currency unit 
for the three year transitional period ending december   the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be subunits of the euro 
at the end of the transitional period  euro banknotes and coins will be issued  and the national currencies of the member states will cease to be legal tender no later than june  the company currently has operations in ireland  which is one of the euro participating countries  and sells product to customers in many of the participating countries 
the functional currency of the company s ireland operations will remain unchanged until december   when it will switch to the euro 
the company is in the process of reviewing and making changes required for euro readiness and does not anticipate the costs associated with the implementation of the euro to be significant 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits which revises the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits and is effective for the company s december  financial reporting 
the adoption of this standard by the company did not result in significant adjustments to existing financial reporting practices as the company does not currently provide pension or postretirement benefits which are subject to the disclosure provisions of fas in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for the company s reporting cycle 
the adoption of this standard by the company is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting practices as the company does not currently hold any derivative financial instruments or participate in hedging activities 
statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  was issued by the american institute of certified public accountants in march and requires capitalization of certain internal use computer software costs 
the company will comply with the requirements of this sop effective for its financial reporting 
the standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies 
to mitigate its exposure to these market risks  the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include a million floating rate revolving credit facility which is used to maintain liquidity and fund its business operations 
at december   the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the nature and amount of the company s borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
beginning in the fourth quarter  upon the commencement of production in its kilkenny  ireland facility  the company began to bill and receive payment from some of its foreign customers in their own currency 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions 
however  as foreign sales approximate of total revenues  management is currently evaluating various strategies to manage this financial market risk  including the implementation of a foreign currency hedging program 
the company did not hold a position in any foreign currency instruments of december
