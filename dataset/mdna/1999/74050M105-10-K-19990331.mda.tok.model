item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of the primary factors affecting premier financial bancorp  inc s the company or premier performance and financial condition 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts and per share data have been restated to give the effect of acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all dollar amounts except per share data are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s rapid growth  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier

in evaluating acquisition opportunities  premier conducts a due diligence review to determine both risks and earnings potential 
desirable candidates have an established base of community involvement  strong local directors  a history of earnings and readily identifiable asset risks 
acquisition transactions are structured to make a fair return on investment while meeting the needs of the shareholders of banks joining premier

results of operations earnings summary premier recorded net income for of  versus  and  restated for and basic earnings per common share were in compared to in and 
in primary increases can be attributed to an increase in net interest income from  in to  in  an increase of  or  and a decrease in provision for income taxes from  in to  in  a difference of or 
offsetting these increases was an increase in the provision for loan losses from  in to  in and an increase in noninterest expense of  from  in to  in net income of  in represented a increase over the amount of  net interest income increased to  in versus  in offsetting this increase was a increase in the provision for loan losses and a  increase in income taxes from  in to  in fully diluted earnings per share increased in compared to despite the increase in the weighted average number of shares from million in to million in net interest income premier s primary source of revenue is its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on its earning assets and the interest paid on the funds acquired to support those assets 
loans made to businesses and individuals are the primary interest earning assets  followed by investment securities and federal funds sold in the inter bank market 
deposits are the primary interest bearing liabilities used to support the interest earning assets 
the level of net interest income is affected by both the balances and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the changes in their corresponding yields and costs  by the volume of interest earning assets funded by non interest bearing deposits  and the level of capital 
premier s long term objective is to manage this income to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate  credit and liquidity risks 
nontaxable income from loans and investment securities is presented on a tax equivalent basis whereby income exempt from tax has been adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the prevailing federal income taxes that would have been paid if the income had been fully taxable 
the discussion of factors influencing net interest income that follows is based on taxable equivalent data 
in each of the three years  this adjustment is based on an assumed federal income tax rate of

in  tax equivalent net interest income increased to  from  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to an increase of  or in average earning assets and an increase of  or in average interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on earning assets in of was basis points lower than the earned in  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in from in consequently  premier s net interest spread decreased from in to in and the net interest margin decreased from in to in the decrease in net interest spread and net interest margin is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the deposit liabilities of the three west virginia branches 
proceeds from these branches were placed in lower yielding assets until higher yielding assets could be generated 
the company also experienced the first full year effect of the issuance in the second quarter of of the company s million in mandatorily redeemable capital securities  the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund the west virginia acquisition 
in an effort to minimize the adverse impact on net income until a permanent investment could be made of the funds from the issuance of the capital securities  the company initiated an investment strategy during the second quarter of of selling approximately million of short term days repurchase agreements and investing the proceeds in to year u 
s 
treasury and agency securities with a weighted average interest rate of approximately higher than the weighted average rate paid on the repurchase agreements 
the company s policy is to unwind its position whenever the spread between the weighted average interest rate of the repurchase agreements and the weighted average rate on the underlying securities falls below basis points 
during the second quarter of  the spread fell below basis points and the company unwound its positions and recognized net gains of  on the sale of the underlying securities in the arbitrage portfolio 
although the company s investment strategy to minimize the adverse impact on net income has been successful  the company s net interest spread and net interest margin have been significantly reduced by its implementation 
excluding the effects of the capital securities and the company s investment strategy  net interest spread would have been in compared to in and net interest margin would have been in versus the achieved in the net interest spread declined basis points from in to in  while the net interest margin  which measures net interest income as a percent of average earning assets  decreased from in to in the decrease in net interest margin is attributable to the issuance of the capital securities in the second quarter of and the utilization of a similar investment strategy as used in to minimize the adverse impact on earnings caused by the temporary placement of the securities proceeds

the allowance is increased by the provision for possible loan losses as well as recoveries of previously charged off loans  and is decreased by loan charge offs 
the provision is the necessary charge to expense to provide for current loan losses and to maintain the allowance at an adequate level commensurate with management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
various factors are taken into consideration when the company determines the amount of the provision and the adequacy of the allowance 
some of the factors include o past due and nonperforming assets  o specific internal analyses of loans requiring special attention  o the current level of regulatory classified and criticized assets and the associated risk factors with each  o examinations and reviews by the company s independent accountants and internal loan review personnel  and o examinations of the loan portfolio by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the data collected from these sources is evaluated with regard to current national and local economic trends  prior loss history  underlying collateral values  credit concentrations  and industry risks 
an estimate of potential future loss on specific loans is developed in conjunction with an overall risk evaluation of the total loan portfolio

allowance as a percentage of year end net loans allowance as a multiple of net charge offs the provision for possible loan losses for was  compared to  in  an increase of this increase can be mainly attributed to loan growth and the provisions necessary to maintain an adequate reserve 
in  net charge offs were compared to  in  a decrease of at december   premier s allowance for possible loan losses was of period end loans compared to at december  this allowance is consistent with the historical net charge off experience

in making the allocation  consideration was given to such factors as management s evaluation of risk in each category  current economic conditions and charge off experience 
an allocation for the allowance for possible loan losses is an estimate of the portion of the allowance that will be used to cover future charge offs in each major loan category  but it does not preclude any portion of the allowance allocated to one type of loan being used to absorb losses of another loan type 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses and percent of loans to total loans dollars in thousands at december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial    real estate mortgage   consumer unallocated total      there were no material changes in estimation methods or assumptions affecting allowance allocation 
any reallocation to the allowance is primarily indicative of changes in loan portfolio mix  not changes in loan concentrations or terms 
the company does consider quality in regards to specific loans when determining an adequate allowance allocation 
the level of increase in nonperforming loans  which is more specifically addressed in the nonperforming loan section  is believed to be temporary and should not materially affect the allowance 
noninterest income and expenses noninterest income is a significant component of the company s total income 
the company continues to develop and enhance existing products and to create new products in order to augment fee income as trends in the financial services industry and the economic environment continue to put pressure on the company s ability to increase its net interest income 
noninterest income includes deposit service charges  fees from data processing and trust services  fees and commissions from many other corporate and retail products and gains and losses from the sale of investment securities 
total fees and other income increased or in to  from  in service charges on deposit accounts increased and all other income increased 
total fees and other income in increased or over in  service charges on deposit accounts increased  insurance commissions increased and other income increased over the amounts recorded in investment securities gains in were versus  in and in the significant increase in was due to the unwinding of an arbitrage investment portfolio established to maximize the utilization of the proceeds received from the issuance of capital securities 
premier recognized a million finder s fee during the second quarter of received in cash and without recourse  the fee is the company s portion of an agreement to assist another financial institution in connection with the acquisition and subsequent resale of several branches of banc one corporation located in west virginia 
noninterest expenses increased  or in  from  in to  in  and increased  or in from  in salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  increased in and in the increases include salary increases and reflect increases in the number of full time equivalent employees from at december  to at december  and at december   due to acquisitions and expansion of the company s business activity

the company incurred expenses relating to the acquisitions of ohio river bank and the west virginia branches of in acquisition expenses of were incurred in and no acquisition expenses were incurred in expenses related to acquisitions are charged to expense for acquisitions accounted for as pooling of interests while certain expenses related to acquisitions accounted for as purchases are capitalized as a component of the purchase price and ultimately increase the amount of goodwill included with the purchase 
goodwill amortization increased in primarily due to the intangible cost regarding branch acquisitions 
the company continually seeks to develop fees and other income for services provided while holding operating expenses to the minimum amount required to provide quality service

financial condition lending activities loans are the company s primary use of financial resources and represent the largest component of earning assets 
the company s loans are made predominantly within the banks market areas and the portfolio is diversified 
credit risk is inherent in each financial institution s loan and investment portfolio 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  the company utilizes a credit administration network  including specific lending authorities for each loan officer  a system of loan committees to review and approve loans  and a loan review and credit quality rating system 
this network assists in the evaluation of the quality of new loans and in the identification of problem or potential problem credits and provides information to aid management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses

the company s real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
a number of the banks do participate in the origination of loans into the secondary market and recognize the referral fees into other income 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in a bank s defined market area who are known to the bank s staff 
consumer loans are made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

all loans considered impaired under sfas are included in nonperforming loans 
the company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans that become days past due as to principal or interest unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
a loan remains in a nonaccrual status until doubts concerning the collectibility no longer exist 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the loan under the original terms 
other real estate is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell

this loan is fully secured by real estate with an appraised value of  and under an agreement with the borrower will be sold during the second quarter 
no loss is anticipated 
the balance of the increase is also largely real estate secured loans except for one loan of  which is currently in litigation 
potential losses on all nonaccrual loans are not expected to be substantial 
the increase in accruing loans past due more than days is primarily represented by one loan of secured by a portfolio of residential and commercial properties the sale of which is expected to occur in the second quarter 
the company continues to follow its long standing policy of not engaging in international lending and not concentrating lending activity in any one industry 
although loans may be classified as nonperforming  many continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contractual rates

additionally  the investment portfolio provides a balance to interest rate and credit risks in other categories of the balance sheet 
the company also uses the securities portfolio as a secondary source of liquidity 
the company has classified the majority of its municipal securities and certain u 
s 
treasury and agency securities as held to maturity based on management s positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity 
these municipal securities provide tax free income and are within management s guidelines with respect to credit risk and market risk 
the municipal securities have been issued principally by kentucky municipalities

deposit activities managing the mix and repricing of deposit liabilities is an important aspect of the company s ability to maximize its net interest margin 
the strategies used to manage interest bearing deposit liabilities are designed to adjust as the interest rate environment changes 
in this regard  management of the company regularly assesses its funding needs  deposit pricing  and interest rate outlooks

the fair value adjustment of the company s available for sale securities portfolio  which is recorded as a component of stockholders equity  may change significantly as market conditions change 
at december  and  the adjustment resulted in a reduction of stockholders equity of and further volatility in stockholders equity may occur in the future as market conditions change 
the company s principal source of funds for dividend payments to stockholders is dividends received from the subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirement limitations 
during  the banks could  without prior approval  declare dividends to the company of approximately  plus any net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration 
the various regulatory agencies having supervisory authority over financial institutions have adopted risk based capital guidelines  which define the adequacy of the capital levels of regulated institutions 
these risk based capital guidelines require minimum levels of capital based upon the risk rating of assets and certain off balance sheet items 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned regulatory risk weights ranging from to depending on their level of credit risk 
the guidelines classify capital in two tiers  tier i and tier  the sum of which is total capital 
tier i capital is essentially common equity  less intangible assets 
tier capital is essentially qualifying long term debt and a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses 
during  the company completed its public offering of million of mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust

liquidity liquidity for a financial institution can be expressed in terms of maintaining sufficient cash flows to meet both existing and unplanned obligations in a cost effective manner 
adequate liquidity allows the company to meet the demands of both the borrower and the depositor on a timely basis  as well as pursuing other business opportunities as they arise 
thus  liquidity management embodies both an asset and liability aspect 
liquidity is maintained through the company s ability to convert assets into cash  manage the maturities of liabilities and generate funds through the attraction of local deposits 
as part of its liquidity management  the company maintains funding relationships with the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions  including a million revolving line of credit available for both general corporate purposes and future acquisitions 
the company prefers to manage its liquidity requirements generally through the matching of maturities of assets and liabilities 
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented in the financial statements provide an indication of the company s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity 
liquidity risk is the possibility that the company may not be able to meet its cash requirements 
management of liquidity risk includes maintenance of adequate cash and sources of cash to fund operations and meets the needs of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
liquidity must be maintained at a level  which is adequate but not excessive 
excess liquidity has a negative impact on earnings resulting from the lower yields on short term assets 
in addition to cash  cash equivalents and federal funds sold  the securities portfolio provides an important source of liquidity 
the total of securities maturing within one year along with cash  due from banks and federal funds sold totaled million as of december  additionally  securities available for sale with maturities greater than one year and equity securities totaled million at december  these securities represent a secondary source available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
to maintain a desired level of liquidity  the company has several sources of funds available 
one is the cash flow generated daily from the banks various loan portfolios in the form of principal and interest payments 
another source is its deposit base 
the company maintains a relatively stable base of customer deposits which has historically exhibited steady growth 
this growth  when combined with other sources  is expected to be adequate to meet its demand for funds 
due to the nature of the markets served by the company s subsidiary banks  management believes that the majority of certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
certificates of deposits and other time deposits of  or more represented approximately and of total deposits at december  and a number of techniques are used to measure the liquidity position  including the utilization of ratios that are presented below 
these ratios are calculated based on annual averages for each year 
liquidity ratios total loans total deposits total loans total deposits less float this analysis shows that the company s loan to deposit ratio decreased in from the and levels 
this is due to the acquisition of deposits held in the west virginia branches 
information regarding short term borrowings for the past three years is presented below

other short term borrowings represent draws on the company s line of credit and federal home loan bank fhlb advances to bank affiliates with varying maturity dates which are funding residential mortgage and commercial loans 
interest rate sensitivity the interest spread and liability funding discussed above are directly related to changes in asset and liability mixes  volumes  maturities and repricing opportunities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those  which are subject to being repriced in the near term  including either floating or adjustable rate instruments and instruments approaching maturity 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between total interest sensitive assets and total interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rates on the company s various asset and liability categories do not respond uniformly to changing market conditions 
interest rate risk is the degree to which interest rate fluctuations in the marketplace can affect net interest income 
the need for interest sensitivity gap management is most critical in times of a significant change in overall interest rates 
management generally seeks to limit the exposure of the company to interest rate fluctuations by maintaining a relatively balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on a one year time horizon 
this mix is altered periodically depending upon management s assessment of current business conditions and the interest rate outlook 
one tool  which is used to monitor interest rate risk  is the interest sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below 
this analysis reflects the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the gap indicates the level of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing over a given time period 
as shown by the interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   the cumulative amount of the company s interest earning assets repricing during the first year is lower than the total amount of its interest bearing liabilities repricing during this period 
this position  which is normally termed a negative interest sensitivity gap  generally allows for enhanced net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
this negative gap is within the company s internal policy guidelines and is not expected to impact significantly the company s net interest income during a period of rising interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of gain or loss from changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
premier s market risk is composed almost exclusively with interest rate risk 
this exposure is managed primarily through the strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since premier s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank advances  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms  which in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap analysis premier uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earnings assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would negatively affect net interest income 
it is management s goal to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
earnings simulation modeling the earnings simulation model forecasts net interest income under different scenarios that incorporate changes in the level of interest rates and their relationships with each other 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would increase by approximately of stable rate net interest income if rates fall by two percentage points over the next year 
it projects a decrease of if the rates rise by two percentage points 
management believes this reflects a slight liability sensitive rate risk position for the one year horizon 
within the same time frame  but assuming an additional one percentage point move in rates  the model forecasts that net interest income would rise above that earned in a stable rate environment by in a falling rate scenario and decrease by in a rising rate scenario 
the slight variance from alco guidelines can be attributed to the large block of deposits held in the west virginia branches that have been temporarily invested in marketable securities while the loan activities of these banks as being reestablished 
management believes this variance to be self correcting as the deposit base held by these branches is reinvested in loans  which is occurring 
this simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time 
loan prepayments are developed from industry median estimates for prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit pricing and sensitivity are assumed to follow historical patterns 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk imbedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point increase in rates is estimated to reduce npv by 
additionally  npv is projected to decrease by if rates fall by basis points 
the calculations of present value have certain shortcomings 
the discount rates utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in this calculation  and therefore  would likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates utilized for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which are not necessarily indicative of the present value of deposits and fhlb advances since such deposits and advances are unique to  and have certain price and customer relationship advantages for  depository institutions 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier designed to further mitigate the effect on the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s net assets from any change in interest rates

stable rate interest rate risk management premier s strategy of investing primarily in loans and securities permits it to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
managing this exposure involves significant assumptions about the relationship of various interest rate indices of certain financial instruments 
prepayments on loans generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates making fixed rate loans more desirable 
investment securities  other than those with early call provisions  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterruptible source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal  while term federal home loan bank advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage prepayment prior to maturity 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a significant interest rate increase 
the previous table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on premier s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities are subject to competitive and other pressures beyond our control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
management expects interest rates to be relatively stable during and believes that the current modest level of liability sensitivity is appropriate 
trade risk management premier does not maintain a trading account  which would primarily provide investment products and risk management services to its customers as well as to take propriety risk positions 
derivative instruments a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
premier currently does not enter into futures  forwards  swaps or options 
however  the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit  which involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk and interest rate in excess of amounts recognized on the balance sheets 
commitments to make loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any contract condition 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral if deemed necessary 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by premier to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specific terms and conditions 
commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the company until the instrument is exercised 
year management has assessed the operational and financial implications of its year needs and developed a plan to ensure that data processing systems can properly handle the change 
management has determined that if a business interruption as a result of the year issue occurred  such an interruption could be material 
the primary effort required to prevent a potential business interruption was the installation of the most current software release from the company s third party provider and replacement of certain system hardware 
the third party software provider has warranted that year remediation and testing efforts to become compliant have been successfully completed 
non compliant hardware has already been replaced through routine hardware upgrades 
management locally installed and tested the current software release before the end of  which completed the year plan for mission critical systems 
non mission critical systems  including systems other than data processing with embedded technology  will continue to be evaluated and if necessary  will be upgraded or replaced 
management projects that the cost of year readiness will be in a range of  to  which will be expensed as incurred 
year expenses are subject to change and could vary from current estimates if the final requirements for year readiness exceed management s expectations
