gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly as a result of an improved product mix toward more proprietary products and reduced material costs as a result of the acquisition of the cloud companies which reduced the company s hardwood flooring costs since the acquisition in july  the improvement in gross profit was offset to some extent by increased labor and overtime expenses associated with the increase in the manufacturing segment s net sales 
gross profit was also impacted by a favorable change of estimates in the company s environmental reserve requirements of approximately million and an unfavorable change of estimates in inventory reserves of approximately million 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit increased  primarily as a result of the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly primarily as a result of the change in product mix with higher levels of sales of used trailers which were at a lower gross profit percentages than the segment as a whole  and due to the margin impact of the company s consolidation of its two aftermarket parts operations during the leasing and finance segment s gross profit declined during as a result of a decrease in net sales 
income from operations years ended december  change operating income by segment dollar amounts in millions manufacturing retail and distribution leasing and finance eliminations total operating income income from operations income before interest  taxes  and other items for the manufacturing segment increased primarily because of the increase in gross profit previously discussed offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily the result of a full year of operations of the retail distribution network acquired in april  and higher usage of the company s accounts receivable securitization facility and the related costs thereof which increased approximately million over income from operations for the retail and distribution segment and the leasing and finance segment were impacted by the changes in the gross profit previously discussed 
other income expense interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

also included in other  net in are gains from the sale of property  plant and equipment of approximately million and interest income of approximately million 
other income expense also includes the company s interest in the losses of etz  a european roadrailer operating company  a share of which the company acquired in november  income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes represented and of pre tax income for and  respectively and differed from the us federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes 
compared to during  the company achieved net sales of million  which were higher than net sales of million 
net income for was million or per share as compared to million or per share in the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain assets of fruehauf trailer corporation fruehauf in april   the completion of the company s composite material facility in lafayette  indiana and an estimated increase in us truck trailer demand 
results of operations net sales years ended december  change dollar amounts in millions net sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution leasing and finance total net sales the manufacturing segment s net sales increased or million in compared to this increase was primarily due to a increase in the number of units sold  reflecting a continued strong demand for the company s products  and a increase in us truck trailer demand 
increased production of the company s proprietary composite plate trailer  the duraplate trailer  also favorably impacted net sales in the manufacturing segment in in august   the company completed the construction of its own composite material facility in lafayette  indiana  and in the fourth quarter began using material from this production line for the assembly of new duraplate trailers 
the retail and distribution segment s net sales increased or million in compared to primarily as a result of the addition of the retail branch distribution network in april  the company s strategy to combine the largest fleet manufacturer with the largest retail distribution network in the us provided immediate benefits by creating critical synergies in the areas of aftermarket parts and service and used trailer sales  particularly the ability to market trade in trailers

the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher levels of expense associated with the retail outlets acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales in and other income expense interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense primarily reflects new term and bank line of credit debt associated with increased working capital requirements due to the establishment of inventory at the retail outlets acquired in april   higher working capital due to increased production at the company s manufacturing facilities and growth in the finance company s leasing operations 
other  net is primarily comprised of a variety of immaterial  non operating expense items

liquidity and capital resources as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company s liquidity position increased million during from million in cash and cash equivalents at december  to million at december  this increase was due to net cash provided by operating and investing activities of offset slightly by net cash used in financing activities of million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million in is primarily the result of net income  the add back of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and as discussed in more detail below  the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable 
changes in other working capital items which offset to an immaterial amount include a slight decrease in inventories excluding the effect of the cloud acquisition coupled with an increase in accounts payable offset somewhat by an increase in prepaid expenses 
the company anticipates future increases in working capital as a result of its branch expansion strategy to be partially offset by improvements in working capital at its manufacturing locations 
on march   the company replaced its existing million receivable sale and servicing agreement with a new three year trade receivable securitization facility 
the new facility allows the company to sell  without recourse on an ongoing basis  all of its accounts receivable to wabash funding corporation funding corp  a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the company 
simultaneously  the funding corp 
has sold and  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in those receivables to a large financial institution 
as of december   million of proceeds were received by the company related to this new facility 
proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement and are reflected as operating cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million in is primarily due to capital expenditures during the year of million  the expansion of the finance company s leasing operation which consumed a net cash outflow of million in and the cloud acquisition in july  of million 
capital expenditures during the period were associated with increasing productivity within the company s manufacturing operations in lafayette  indiana  development of a new state of the art painting and coating system and plant expansion at its trailer manufacturing facility in huntsville  tennessee  the acquisition of a new consolidated parts center in lafayette  increasing capacity and manufacturing productivity at its recently acquired flooring operations in arkansas and other operating purposes 
the flooring operations were acquired in july and were financed through the issuance of million of convertible preferred stock  million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
the company continues to pursue its branch expansion strategy  which includes the replacement of several existing sites within the same market as well as the addition of approximately locations in new markets throughout north america 
the company is in various stages of completing several of these transactions although no significant purchase commitments were in existence at year end

in addition  the company has future residual guarantees or purchase options of approximately million and million  respectively  related to certain new and used trailer transactions 
the majority of these do not come due until or after 
the company anticipates purchasing these trailers at the expiration of the contracts and subsequently selling them through the retail branch network or leasing them through the finance company 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities of million in is primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of million  offset by a net reduction in the company s long term revolver of million and a pay down of long term debt of million primarily associated with the cloud acquisition 
on april   the company sold million shares of its common stock in a registered public offering at a public offering price of per share  for net proceeds to the company of million

other sources of funds for capital expenditures  continued expansion of businesses  dividends  principal repayments on debt  stock repurchase and working capital requirements are expected to be cash from operations  additional borrowings under the credit facilities and term borrowings and equity offerings 
the company believes these funding sources will be adequate for its anticipated requirements 
inflation the company has been generally able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s business 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  during sfas no 
established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income is not reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as the company had no items of other comprehensive income for the periods presented 
the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  as of december  sfas no 
requires companies to modify or expand the financial statement disclosures for operating segments based on the way management divides the company for making internal operating decisions 
the adoption of this statement did not affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  beginning of fiscal year for the company 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
management has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its earnings or statement of financial position 
however  management anticipates that  due to its limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in march  statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  was issued which specifies the appropriate accounting for costs incurred to develop or obtain computer software for internal use 
the new pronouncement provides guidance on which costs should be capitalized  when and over what period such costs should be amortized and what disclosures should be made regarding such costs 
the company must adopt the pronouncement by the end of previously capitalized costs will not be adjusted 
the company believes that it is already in substantial compliance with the accounting requirements as set forth in this new pronouncement and therefore believes that adoption will not have a material effect on financial conditions or operating results 
year compliance the company continues to address the impact of the year issue on its business 
if not corrected certain computer applications may fail or create erroneous results at the year specifically  with respect to the company  this includes applications within information technology it as well as non it equipment and machinery that may contain embedded date sensitive microcontrollers or microchips 
information technology systems the company s assessment of all business critical it hardware and software is complete 
it has been determined that many of the company s applications and systems are already year compliant  however  it will be necessary to modify or replace other applications and systems 
during this assessment  it was determined that systems in place within the company s retail and distribution network and certain of its manufacturing operations are not year compliant 
as a result  during  the company will install new application systems or modify existing systems within these areas in order to be year compliant 
other maintenance and project activities to be conducted in have been initiated to bring the remaining hardware and software into compliance 
if such projects are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan for it items includes the following phases and timeline assessment and strategy substantially completed in and design  implementation  testing and validation in process and scheduled to be substantially completed by mid non information technology systems the company s assessment of non it systems is approximately complete 
it is expected that the assessment and necessary replacements or upgrades will be substantially completed by the second quarter in external parties the company has contacted its vendors and suppliers regarding the status of their year compliance 
many vendors have given a positive indication that they are or will be compliant 
a follow up inquiry is continuing with the parties identified as business critical 
this process is approximately complete and is expected to be substantially completed by the first quarter in while compliance issues may be identified and addressed  this process may not fully ensure these parties year compliance 
disruptions in the operations of these parties could have an adverse financial and operational effect on the company 
the company has formulated a contingency plan in the event business critical vendors do not achieve year compliance and suffer substantial disruptions in their operations 
this plan includes advance purchasing of critical production materials  identification of substitute materials already existing at the manufacturing sites and to contact alternate vendors previously identified for availability of critical materials or viable substitutes 
in the event of it failure in this area  purchase orders can be handwritten and forwarded via us mail or fax 
the company has requested compliance information from its banks and it has been determined that they expect to be compliant by the second quarter in the company is currently identifying alternate banking relationships in the event that its current banks are determined to be non compliant 
in the event alternative banking relationships are required  they are expected to be in place by the third quarter in costs of compliance the company estimates the total costs to be incurred in installing new application systems in the retail and distribution network and certain manufacturing operations  along with costs associated with year compliance to be between to million 
through december   the company has spent approximately million  including internal labor costs  related to such activities 
management believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and hardware  the year issue is not likely to materially impact the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company expects all of its internal business critical it and non it systems to be year compliant and therefore no contingency plan is in place in the event of a particular system not being year compliant 
such a plan will be developed if it becomes clear that the company is not going to achieve its scheduled compliance objectives 
however  because most computer systems are interdependent by nature  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely  will be timely converted and not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
market risks the company has limited exposure to financial risk resulting from volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the company had approximately million of libor based debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility and million of proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization facility  which also requires libor based interest payments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would correspond to a million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts principally against the german deutschemark and french franc to hedge the net receivable payable position arising from trade sales including lease revenues and purchases primarily with regard to the company s european roadrailer operations 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
additional disclosure related to the company s risk management policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements
