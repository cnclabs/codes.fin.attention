a potential problem exists for all companies that rely on computers as the year approaches 
the year problem is the result of the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
this practice could result in incorrect results when the company s computers or those of the third parties with which it deals perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or data field sorting involving years later than the company has conducted a preliminary assessment of its computer systems to identify items that could be impacted by the year issue and formulated the following course of action 
the company will begin reviewing its non information technology systems in mid although the company does not anticipate that non information technology systems will pose a major problem  as its reliance on such systems is relatively small  non information technology systems are more difficult to evaluate and repair than information technology systems and may require replacement 
the company has already begun its review of its information technology systems and will make necessary software upgrades in in addition  the company has been separately evaluating its accounting software and is currently in the process of implementing a new system with implementation anticipated to be complete during the second quarter of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario the company faces in regards to year problems is a lack of compliance on the part of the third parties with which it deals 
though not highly dependent on any particular vendor  the failure on the part of its vendors could result in the company not being able to get those supplies it needs to administer its business 
the company is prepared to find alternative vendors should this problem result and is considering building up an inventory of any necessary supplies to prevent any shortage if such an eventuality were to occur 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test all of its software 
the company preliminarily estimates that it will cost  to evaluate  reprogram and replace equipment and software to ensure year compliance  of which all  will likely be spent on outside consultants 
in addition  as discussed above  the company is going to spend  to replace its existing accounting system 
such costs are being financed through an existing line of credit and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company is addressing its year compliance needs by implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp application on a new ibm as platform 
since its custom written software will be modified to work with its new erp system  the company will design and test its systems to be year compliant during seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal  with approximately of its revenues and most of its profits recorded in the months of november  december  and january 
as a result  the company s working capital requirements are highest during november and december when the combination of receivables and inventory are at peak levels 
the company typically experiences losses in its second and third quarters 
as the results from the company s growth strategy develop  the effects of seasonality should be diminished 
the business segments on which the company has chosen to focus offer steadier revenue flows  as well as more consistent requirements for working capital 
inflation although the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation  inflation has an influence on the cost of the company s products and services  supplies  salaries  and benefits 
the company attempts to minimize or offset the effects of inflation through increased sales volumes and sales prices  improved productivity  alternative sourcing of products and supplies  and reduction of other costs 
the company generally has been able to offset the impact of price increases from suppliers by increases in the selling prices of the company s products and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on its debt obligations 
the company is not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk or investment risk 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term debt obligation line of credit 
the interest rate on this line of credit is prime plus percent 
the prime interest rate at december  was percent 
the company s line of credit is renewable and negotiable yearly 
the fluctuation of the interest rate may increase interest expense if the prime interest rate increases before the line of credit could be renegotiated to a fixed rate loan
