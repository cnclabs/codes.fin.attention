graphic table bar graph indicating the components of capitalization for the following years  in millions short term debt and current maturities long term debt capital securities note minority interest shareholders equity total capitalization  financial instruments and risk management the company uses financial derivatives to manage its interest rate and global foreign exchange exposure 
interest rate swaps and options are used principally to manage the company s floating rate exposure and to hedge anticipated debt issuance transactions 
forward exchange contracts and cross currency options serve primarily to protect the functional currency value of non functional currency positions and anticipated transactions of the company and its foreign subsidiaries 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or use leveraged derivatives in its financial risk management program 
interest rate risk management arvin relies significantly on long term fixed rate debt in its capital structure 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the fixed rate to floating rate balance of its interest sensitive liabilities 
the company s outstanding interest sensitive financial instruments as of january   are reflected in note to the financial statements 
in addition to items included in the table presented in note  arvin also had million par value of percent company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities of subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debentures of the company capital securities due  callable in  and one interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million outstanding at year end 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  arvin receives a fixed rate of percent for three years and pays a libor based floating rate which resets every six months 
the swap agreement matures on april at january  the fair value of long term debt  including that due within one year  plus capital securities and swaps approximated million 
the carrying value at that date was million 
the fair value was estimated using quoted market prices and discounted cash flow analyses  based on the company s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of lending arrangements 
changes in interest rates that may occur within the next months will have a minimal effect on future interest expense based upon arvin s year end borrowing structure 
if interest rates rise immediately by a percent increment across the entire yield curve  arvin s interest expense will increase  and thus pre tax earnings will decrease  by less than 
million in the company may borrow up to million under its multi currency credit facility agreement  which matures on august  no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at year end 
if the facility fee were priced at current market levels  the incremental cost to arvin would be approximately basis points annually on the total facility 
foreign exchange risk management at year end  the company had forward foreign exchange contracts totaling million outstanding to hedge certain financial and operating transactions denominated in currencies other than various functional currencies 
the full amount of the forward contracts at year end hedged existing non functional currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the market value of the contracts at year end totaled 
million 
over percent of the contracts outstanding at year end matured within one month thereafter 
the furthest maturity date is july  the company manages its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for existing transactions by limiting each operating unit s booked exposure to a specified level for each non functional currency 
the following table lists the net positions of forward contracts outstanding by currency with the euro legacy currencies combined 
currency net position in millions  local currency euro eur canadian dollar cad great britain pound gbp us dollar usd although the company used forward contracts during to hedge anticipated non functional currency denominated transactions  there were none outstanding at year end 
arvin manages the foreign currency risk of anticipated transactions by forecasting such cash flows at the operating entity level  compiling the total company exposure and entering into forward foreign exchange contracts to lessen foreign exchange exposures deemed excessive 
during  the company also used foreign exchange options to reduce the company s exposure to changes in exchange rates 
these option contracts were principally in the major european currencies  and were written for a term of less than one year 
there were no option contracts outstanding at year end legal environmental matters the company and its consolidated subsidiaries are defending various environmental claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of business or from previously owned businesses 
such matters are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements

year during  arvin named a task force and began actively working with customers  suppliers  and employees on arvin s plan to address both information technology it and non it related year issues 
non it systems include  but are not limited to  those systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as manufacturing equipment  building access  telephone systems and other miscellaneous systems 
except for one location where new systems are being implemented  the company has essentially completed the remediation  testing and implementation phase of the year project as of the end of for both it and non it systems 
these phases represent percent of arvin s year project and involved taking an inventory of all potentially affected systems  identifying potential year issues  fixing or replacing such problems  and testing the changes made 
the final percent of the year project  auditing  is scheduled for completion during this phase will consist of arvin conducting self assessment reviews  performing comprehensive tests of the it systems in a year simulated environment  reviewing the results of such testing  and putting in place any necessary contingency plans 
given the progress on this project  the company plans to assess the need for a formal contingency plan in june and will analyze what the worst case scenario would be if the company s year project were not completed as scheduled at that time 
the company has developed a year process for dealing with its key suppliers 
the process generally involves the following steps initial supplier survey  risk assessment  and auditing critical suppliers 
the first two steps are essentially complete and the audits are expected to be completed by the end of the first half of contingent plans for non compliant suppliers will be developed as the audits are completed 
these activities provide a means of managing risk  but cannot eliminate the potential for disruption due to third party failure 
the company continues to work with major customers on ensuring that its electronic exchanges of data will continue to work 
expenses of the year project are expensed as incurred 
to date  approximately three million dollars has been expensed for this project 
the company expects that an additional one million dollars will be expensed during to complete this project 
capital expenditures are generally replacing fully depreciated assets and have not had a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition and are not expected to in the future
