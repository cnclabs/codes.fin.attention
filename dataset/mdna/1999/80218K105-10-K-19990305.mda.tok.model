based on operating results for  the company estimates that on an annualized basis a per mcf increase or decrease in its average natural gas sales price would result in a corresponding million change in net income and a million change in cash flow from operating activities 
the foregoing estimates do not give effect to changes in any other factors  such as the effect of the company s oil hedging program  its debt levels and related interest expense  its reserve levels or the level of capital expenditures  that might result from a change in crude oil and natural gas prices

liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures 
in  the company s primary needs for cash were for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the company spent million for capital expenditures in and expects to spend approximately million in because the actual amounts expended in the future and the results therefrom will be influenced by numerous factors  including many beyond the company s control  no assurances can be given as to the amounts that will be expended 
the board of directors has authorized the company to buy back up to million of its common stock to meet the requirements of outstanding stock options and to satisfy the stock requirements of employee benefit plans 
from december through october  the company purchased million common shares for approximately million 
the company is not currently buying back its common stock 
capital resources 
the company s capital resources consisted of cash flow from operating activities of million and funds available under its bank credit facilities including its revolving credit agreement the credit agreement which matures may  subject to the covenants described below  the credit agreement permits the company to obtain revolving credit loans and issue letters of credit having a maximum aggregate amount of million of which million is available for letters of credit 
borrowings under the agreement are unsecured and interest rates are tied to the agent bank s prime rate or eurodollar offering rate  at the company s option 
actual interest rates varied from to for the year ended december  at december   the company had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  which were classified as long term debt on the balance sheet since the company has the ability and intends to refinance such amount on a long term basis 
the company had one letter of credit outstanding under the credit agreement at december  for million and one letter of credit outside the credit agreement for million 
the credit agreement and the indenture for the debentures see note to the consolidated financial statements include covenants that restrict the company s ability to take certain actions  including the ability to incur additional indebtedness and to pay dividends or repurchase capital stock

actual interest rates varied from to for the year ended december  the company has historically funded its operations and capital spending programs with cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and the borrowing availability under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital requirements for environmental matters 
almost all phases of the company s oil and gas operations are subject to stringent environmental regulation by governmental authorities 
such regulation has increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and other facilities 
the company has expended significant financial and managerial resources to comply with such regulations 
although the company believes its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas operations 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from the company s operations  could result in significant costs and liabilities in the future 
as has been done in the past  the company intends to fund its cost of environmental compliance from operating cash flows

although indonesia has a well established history of honoring its contractual commitments and concession terms  it is uncertain which political party will take control over indonesia s government in elections scheduled this summer or whether the new government will seek reforms in  or take other actions with respect to  governmental concessions and production sharing contracts 
one effect of the currency devaluation has been to reduce certain operating and administrative costs incurred by the company in its indonesian operations  thus reducing the number of cost recovery barrels it retains in reimbursement of such expenses  and to reduce the value of certain receivables and payables which are denominated in the local currency  the rupiah

absent corrective actions  a computer program or embedded chip that is date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to various activities and operations 
the company has developed a plan to identify those risks related to the year problem  to remediate systems and equipment where required and to test for year compliance 
the company has identified all critical computer systems and determined the remediation that will be performed 
the company has already made the required modifications to its domestic accounting systems  is in the process of making modifications to indonesian accounting systems and plans to install a new accounting system in argentina by mid year the company has engaged an outside consulting firm to assist in reviewing field equipment used in its oil and gas producing operations for year issues

the company is in the process of developing a business contingency plan in order to mitigate potential disruption to business operations 
the company expects to complete this contingency plan by the second quarter of but also expects to refine this plan throughout with regard to risks relating to third parties  the company has implemented a program to request year certification or other assurance from its significant customers  transporters  partners and suppliers 
the company has reviewed and evaluated its most reasonably likely worst case scenario with regard to the year management believes that it is taking every reasonable precaution to detect  remediate and test all critical computer systems and equipment 
management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would involve failure of production equipment in the field  which would result in disruption of those operations affected until the problem is solved and possibly expose the company to contractual penalties and other liabilities 
the company is in the process of reviewing snyder s computer systems and year compliance program to determine which systems will be retained by santa fe 
see part i  items and  business and properties for further discussion on the proposed merger 
through december  the company has spent million for identifying  remediating and testing systems for year related problems 
the company currently estimates that its year related costs will be between million and million  but this estimate may change as a result of the review of the equipment used in its oil and gas producing operations 
market risks the company is exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk 
the company produces and sells crude oil  liquids and natural gas 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market factors 
the company made a limited use of futures contracts during the year to reduce its exposure to declines in market prices 
the company used the hedge method of accounting for these instruments and  as a result  gains and losses on commodity futures contracts were generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
at december   the company had no open crude oil sales hedges 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
to date  the company has not deemed it necessary to enter into any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  because interest rates have remained at historically low levels
