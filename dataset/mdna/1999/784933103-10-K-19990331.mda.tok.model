liquidity and capital resources on march   the company completed an initial public offering of its common stock  raising million

as of january   the company used the proceeds from the offering to repay bank debt of million  to repurchase  shares of the company s stock for approximately million and to fund the company s operating losses in and during the year ended january   the company had a net decrease in cash of million  resulting from its operating losses and restructure charge payments and a reduction in accounts payable  that were offset partially by a reduction in accounts receivable  income tax receivable and proceeds of million from its line of credit 
in march  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to repurchase up to  shares of common stock from time to time in the open market  depending on market conditions 
this program was funded by proceeds from the initial public offering 
as of july   the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million 
no further repurchases are currently planned 
in december  pia merchandising co  inc pia co 
and another subsidiary of pia entered into a loan and security agreement with mellon bank  na the agreement provides for a revolving line of credit that allows maximum borrowing of million and requires pia co 
to borrow and maintain a minimum balance of million 
the three year credit facility will be used for working capital purposes and potential acquisitions 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at january  compared with million at december  at january  and december   the company had working capital of million and million  respectively  and current ratios of and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in was million  compared with million in this use of cash for operating activities in resulted primarily from net operating losses of million and a reduction in accrued liabilities primarily attributed to the company s restructuring and other charges and a reduction in accounts payable of million related to a reduction in third party payroll liability 
these uses were offset by an income tax refund of million outstanding in and a decrease in account receivable of million from improved collection of outstanding accounts 
net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million in from additions to property and equipment and internally developed software 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in in the company received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and increased the line of credit by million 
the above activity resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended january  cash and cash equivalents and the timely collection of its receivables provide the company s current liquidity 
however  the potential uncollectibility of receivables due from any of pia s major clients  or a significant reduction in business from such clients  or the inability to acquire new clients would have an adverse material effect on the company s cash resources and its ongoing ability to fund operations 
the company had a million loss and experienced a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended january  however  with the addition of the revolving line of credit  timely collection of receivables  and the company s positive working capital position  management believes the funding of operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient 
pia may incur additional indebtedness in in connection with the merger 
spar group acquired the assets of an incentive marketing company in january a portion of the purchase price was paid through the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of  plus an earnout  if any  which matures on september  in addition  the stockholders of spar group loaned spar group  to facilitate the acquisition 
if this indebtedness is not repaid before the transaction with pia is consummated  the combined company will assume these obligations 
pia will also be obligated  under certain circumstances  to pay severance compensation to its employees in connection with the merger 
further  pia will incur substantial costs in connection with the transaction  including legal fees of approximately million and investment banking fees of approximately million 
pia has entered into discussions with mellon bank to increase its credit line to enable it to meet its cash needs in connection with the merger and future potential acquisitions in year software costs many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as a result  many date sensitive computer applications will fail beginning january  because they are unable to process dates properly beyond december  pia has reviewed its computer systems to identify areas that could be affected by year issues and has implemented a plan to resolve these issues 
pia has substantially completed the evaluation of its information technology infrastructure  software  hardware and communications systems 
pia believes that its critical hardware and software applications are currently year compliant 
completion of pia s plan to upgrade all hardware and software applications to be year compliant is expected by the third quarter of third party vendors are also being reviewed for year compliance and pia expects this risk assessment to be complete by the second quarter of pia s assessment and evaluation efforts include testing systems  inquiries of third parties and other research 
by implementing significant systems upgrades  pia believes that it has substantially reduced its potential internal exposure to year problems 
in the event that certain systems fail to function properly  manual processes will be implemented 
due to the nature of the business  pia does not anticipate a system failure to cease the operations  as operations are not deemed to be systems dependent 
additionally  pia plans to be capable of operating in the event of a systems failure of any vendor 
pia will utilize internal resources to reprogram  or replace and test the software for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately  was expensed in the fiscal year and the remaining  will be expensed in it is not expected that these costs will have a material effect on the results of operations 
the extent and magnitude of the year problem as it will affect pia externally  both before and after january   is difficult to predict or quantify for a number of reasons 
these include the lack of control over systems that are used by third parties that are critical to pia s operation  the complexity of testing inter connected networks and applications that depend on third party networks 
if any of these third parties experience year problems  it could have a material adverse effect on pia 
pia is not currently aware of any material operational issues associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  or the adequacy of critical third party systems 
pia has not developed a contingency plan in case it does not achieve year compliance on or before december  the results of its evaluation and assessment efforts do not indicate a need for contingency planning 
pia intends to continue assessing its year compliance  implementing compliance plans and communicating with third parties about their year compliance 
if pia s continued efforts indicate that contingency planning is prudent  pia will undertake appropriate planning at that time
