item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of the company s expectations regarding future trends affecting its business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following discussion sets forth certain factors the company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update the information contained in this item results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the dollars and percentage of total revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income fiscal year ended march  march  march  in thousands net revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    operating expenses engineering and development    selling and marketing    general and administrative    total operating expenses    operating income    net revenues the company s net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of scsi and fibre channel based i o products and enclosure management products 
license fees and non recurring engineering fees also contribute to the company s net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was the result of a million increase in sales of the host board product line  a million increase in sales of the tec product line  a million increase in sales of the gem product line and a million increase in sales of the ftec product line 
net revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was the result of an million increase in sales of the host board product line  combined with a million increase in sales in the fas product line 
a partially offsetting decline of million occurred in license fees 
export revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal  to approximately million  primarily due to increased sales to customers in japan and to a lessor extent  europe 
export revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal  to approximately million  primarily due to increased sales to customers in europe  along with smaller increases from southeast asia 
countries in the pacific rim continue to suffer from the influence of the asian economic crisis 
this could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
export revenues primarily to the pacific rim countries of the company s products amounted to million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million of net revenues for fiscal year as a percentage of net revenues  export revenues accounted for in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year export revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not expect the uncertainty in selected pacific rim foreign currency markets to have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues  and the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s six largest customers in each respective period accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal year  and in fiscal years and for fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues  and sun microsystems  inc accounted for of the company s net revenues 
for fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues  sun microsystems  inc accounted for  of net revenues 
for fiscal  and sun microsystems  inc accounted for of net revenues  tokyo electron limited accounted for  and fujitsu limited accounted for 
the company believes that its major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternate or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from the company 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit cost of revenues consist primarily of raw materials including wafers and completed chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test labor  overhead and warranty costs 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal was  an increase from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage increase was due to the introduction of new  higher margin products and volume related cost reductions on mature products  combined with improved quality resulting in reduced scrap expenses 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal was  an increase from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage increase was due to a shift in product mix to products with lower unit costs  as well as increased production volumes 
additionally  multiple disciplines within the company worked together to improve inventory management 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal was  an increase from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage increase was due to increased revenue from products that contain higher levels of integration and functionality and are generally associated with higher average selling prices and gross margins 
the company continued to focus on reducing component costs as well as implementing design efficiencies during fiscal the company s ability to maintain its current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as supply costs and  in particular  the cost of silicon wafers  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products and the company s ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
the company anticipates that it will be increasingly more difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result  the company does not anticipate gross profit percentage to increase at a rate consistent with historic trends 
operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  development related material  occupancy costs  and computer support 
the company believes that continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving its strategic objectives 
the company expects that engineering and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal engineering and development expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in spending each fiscal year was largely due to increased levels of spending for fibre channel and scsi design and engineering support 
additionally  in the company incurred a million charge for acquired in process technology relating to the acquisition of silicon design resources  inc selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing salaries  sales commissions and related expenses  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
the company believes continued investments of these type of expenses are critical to the success of its strategy of expanding relationships with its customers 
as a result  the company expects sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in the future 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in dollars reflected an increased level of sales commissions paid as a result of the increase in revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal to fiscal relates to economies of scale realized from the growth in net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal due to increases in sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  human resources and information technology personnel 
non personnel related expenses consist of recruiting fees  professional services and corporate expenses 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as it adds personnel and incurs additional costs relating to the growth of the business and its operation as a public company 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  and million in fiscal and as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in outside services related to the acquisition of silicon design resources  inc additionally  salaries and fringe benefits increased by million due to an increase in general and administrative personnel 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues is due to the company benefiting from economies of scale related to the increases in net revenue 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent in fiscal year and non operating income interest and other income  net of interest expense  was million in  million in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in interest and other income in fiscal and are largely due to increases in cash equivalents and investment balances due to million in net proceeds received from a secondary stock offering in the second quarter of fiscal additionally  cash equivalent and investment balances have increased due to cash flow from operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
income tax provision the company s effective tax rates were approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in tax rate in fiscal is due to benefits realized from research and development and other tax credits as well as the movement of a portion of the company s investments into tax exempt securities 
the decrease in tax rate in fiscal is due to the decrease in the valuation allowance relating to the company s deferred tax assets  and to a lesser extent  the movement of a portion of the company s investments into tax exempt securities 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
it further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as fair value  cash flow and foreign currency hedges  and establishes respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of the instruments 
the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet determined the impact of adopting this new standard on the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s combined balances of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments have increased to million at march  and million at march  the increases are primarily attributable to receiving net proceeds of million from a secondary stock offering in the second quarter of fiscal additionally  the increase in cash flow from operations in those fiscal years has increased the combined balances of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
the company s primary source of liquidity is derived from working capital and a million unsecured line of credit with silicon valley bank 
working capital increased million to million at march  and increased million to million at march  the increase in working capital in fiscal is largely attributable to cash flow from operations 
the increase in working capital in fiscal is attributable to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of the proceeds from the secondary stock offering 
the million line of credit facility with silicon valley bank allows the company to borrow at the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility expires on july   and  although there can be no assurance  the company currently expects to renew this line of credit 
there are no borrowings under this credit facility at march  the company s cash flow provided by operations was million in fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the growth in cash provided by operations is primarily due to increases in profitability for those fiscal years 
additionally  in fiscal year  cash flow from operations was improved by increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and was offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in income taxes payable 
in fiscal year  cash flow from operations was improved by increases to income taxes payable and accounts payable and was partially offset by an increase to accounts receivable 
the company s cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to decreases in purchases of short and long term investments  net of maturing investments 
in fiscal year  the increase in the cash used in investing activities relates to purchases of short and long term investments  net of maturing investments 
additionally  capital expenditures were million in fiscal  and million in both fiscal and fiscal during fiscal year  the company anticipates spending between million to million for leasehold improvements and relocation related expenses associated with the corporate headquarters relocation to aliso viejo  california 
the company may exercise its option to purchase the aliso viejo facility which could increase the company s potential cash expenditures to approximately to million 
the company s cash flow provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the cash provided by financing activities for fiscal years and is primarily due to increases in proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans 
for fiscal year  the majority of the cash provided by financing activities was generated from a secondary stock offering in the second quarter of that year 
the company believes that it has sufficient working capital and an available credit facility to finance its operations for fiscal year factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained herein  the information in this report constitutes forward looking statements 
when used in this report the words shall  should  forecast  all of  projected  believes  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  the company may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
the company wishes to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed above in business or management s discussion and analysis of condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this report 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current profitability in the future 
a significant portion of the company s net revenues in each fiscal quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
in the past  a significant percentage of the company s quarterly bookings and sales to major customers occurred during the last month of the quarter  and there can be no assurance that this trend will not return in the future 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for the company s products 
changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of the company s major customers  customer order changes or rescheduling  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of the company s products  negotiations of rebates and extended payment terms  as well as changes in the ability of the company to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders  could result in material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
certain large oem customers may require the company to maintain higher levels of inventory  or field warehouses in attempt to minimize their own inventories 
in addition  the company must order its products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  and because the markets for the company s products are subject to rapid technological and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventory of particular products 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventory or is required to hold excess inventory  the company s operating results could be adversely effected 
other factors that could cause the company s sales and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include the time  availability and sale of new products  seasonal oem customer demand  such as the decline experienced in the fiscal quarter ended june   changes in the mix of products having differing gross margins  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  including silicon wafers  warranty expenses  variations in product development and other operating expenses  adoption of new accounting pronouncements and or changes in company policies and general economic and other conditions effecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending 
the company s quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including pricing and availability of the company s and its competitors products 
although the company does not maintain its own wafer manufacturing facility  a large portion of the company s expenses is fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet the company s expectations  the company s fixed expenses would exacerbate the effect on net income of such shortfall in net revenues 
furthermore  announcements by the company  its competitors or others regarding new products and technologies could cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of the company s products 
order deferrals by the company s customers  delays in the company s introduction of new products and longer than anticipated design in cycles for the company s products have in the past adversely effected the company s quarterly results of operations 
due to all of the foregoing factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely effected 
dependence on small number of customers a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues  and the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any of the company s major customers would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of these customers are based in the pacific rim  which is subject to economic and political uncertainties 
in addition  a majority of the company s customers order the company s products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from the company for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over the company and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  upon which the company and such customers do business  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers merging or acquiring other customers of the company 
as the company s oem customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  the company may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for its products before it knows how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if the company is unable to achieve such cost reductions  the company s gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company provides certain customers with price protection in the event that the company reduces the prices of its products 
while the company maintains reserves for such price protection  there can be no assurance that the impact of future price reductions by the company will not exceed the company s reserves in any specific fiscal period 
any price protection in excess of recorded reserves could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the markets for both peripheral and host computer products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  the company s competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
a design win usually ensures a customer will purchase the product until a higher performance standard is available or a competitor can demonstrate a significant price performance advantage 
most of the company s products compete with products available from several companies  many of which have substantially greater research and development  long term guaranteed supply capacity  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability and customer support organizations than those of the company 
the company believes that its future operating results will depend  in part  upon its ability to continue to improve product and process technologies and develop new technologies in order to achieve or maintain the performance advantages of products and processes relative to competitors  to adapt products and processes to technological changes  and to identify and adopt emerging industry standards 
because of the complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing products on a timely basis 
if the company is unable to design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  its future operating results would be materially and adversely effected 
the company currently competes primarily with texas instruments  adaptec  inc and lsi logic in the scsi sector of the i o market 
in the fibre channel sector of the i o market  the company competes primarily with texas instruments  lsi logic  hewlett packard company and emulex corporation 
in the ide sector  the company competes with st microelectronics and cirrus logic  inc in the enclosure management sector  the company competes primarily with the symbios division of lsi logic and the serano division of vitesse semiconductor corporation 
the company may compete with some of its larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop i o controller integrated circuits for use in their own products 
at least one large oem customer in the past has decided to vertically integrate and has therefore ceased purchases from the company 
the company will need to continue to develop products appropriate to its markets to remain competitive as its competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while the company continues to devote significant resources to research and development  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that the company will develop and introduce new technology and products in a timely manner 
further  several of the company s competitors have greater resources devoted to securing semiconductor foundry capacity eg long term agreements regarding supply flow  equity or financing agreements or direct ownership of a foundry 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of scsi and other i o products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in  and resources devoted to  these markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully in the future 
dependence on wafer suppliers and other subcontractors the company currently relies on several independent foundries to manufacture its semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
generally  the company conducts business with some of its foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order as may be accepted by a foundry 
to the extent a foundry terminates its relationship with the company or should the company s supply from a foundry be interrupted or terminated for any other reason  the company may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
historically  there have been periods when there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
the company is continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries has in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that new supply sources will be able or willing to satisfy the company s wafer requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 
while the quality  yield and timeliness of wafer deliveries to date have been acceptable  there can be no assurance that manufacturing yield problems will not occur in the future 
the company is using multiple sources of supply for certain of its products  which may require the company s customers to perform separate product qualifications 
the company has not  however  developed alternate sources of supply for certain other products and its newly introduced products are typically produced initially by a single foundry until alternate sources can be qualified 
in particular  the company s integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy the company s requirements for this technology  the company s marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  its results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the requirement that a customer perform separate product qualifications or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from the company may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from the company s competitors  which would adversely effect the company s results of operations 
the company s ability to obtain satisfactory wafer and other supplies is subject to a number of other risks 
these risks include that the company s suppliers may be subject to injunctions arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights 
the enforcement of such an injunction could impede a supplier s ability to provide wafers  components or packaging services to the company 
in addition  the company s flexibility to move production of any particular product from one foundry to another can be limited in that such a move can require significant re engineering  which may take several quarters 
these efforts also divert engineering resources which otherwise could be dedicated to new product development  which would adversely affect new product development schedules 
accordingly  production may be constrained even though capacity is available at one or more foundries 
in addition  the company could encounter supply shortages if sales grow substantially 
the company uses domestic and offshore subcontractors for die assembly of its semiconductor products purchased in wafer form  and for assembly of its host adapter board products 
the company s reliance on independent subcontractors to provide these services involves a number of risks  including the absence of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
the company is also subject to the risks of shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of the company s products 
in addition  the company may receive orders for large volumes of products to be shipped within short periods  and the company may not have sufficient testing capacity to fill such orders 
constraints or delays in the supply of the company s products  whether because of capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the company s foundries or subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers and other material adverse effects on the company s operating results  including those that may result should the company be forced to purchase products from higher cost foundries or pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply 
transactions to obtain manufacturing capacity  future capital needs the company is not currently experiencing any difficulties in obtaining sufficient foundry capacity due to the current availability of worldwide semiconductor fabrication capacity 
however  the company and the semiconductor industry have  in the past  experienced shortages of available foundry capacity 
accordingly  in order to secure an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company may consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods or equity investments in  or advances to  wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any of these transactions would involve financial risk to the company and could require the company to commit substantial capital or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
the need to commit substantial capital may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale or issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
reliance on high performance computer and computer peripheral market a significant portion of the company s host adapter board products and hard disk drive controller products are ultimately used in high performance file servers  workstations and other office automation products 
the company s growth has been supported by increasing demand for sophisticated i o solutions which support database systems  servers  workstations  internet intranet applications  multimedia and telecommunications 
should there be a slowing in the growth of demand for such systems  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
as a supplier of controller products to manufacturers of computer peripherals such as disk drives and other data storage devices  a portion of the company s business is dependent on the overall market for computer peripherals 
this market  which itself is dependent on the market for computers  has historically been characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and contraction 
as a result  suppliers to the computer peripherals industry from time to time experience large and sudden fluctuations in demand for their products as their customers adjust to changing conditions in their markets 
if these fluctuations are not accurately anticipated  such suppliers  including the company  could produce excessive or insufficient inventories of various components  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
rapid technological change  dependence on new products  industry standards the markets in which the company and its competitors compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
the company s future success depends on its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  adequately address oem customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
the company believes that to remain competitive in the future it will need to continue to develop new products  which will require the investment of significant financial resources in new product development 
in anticipation of the implementation of fibre channel data transfer interface technologies  the company has invested  and will continue to invest  significant resources in developing its integrated circuit single chip pci to fibre channel controllers 
there can be no assurance that fibre channel will be adopted as a predominant industry standard 
the company is aware of products for alternative i o standards and enabling technologies being developed by its competitors 
the company believes that certain competitors  including adaptec  inc  have extensive development efforts related to products based on new parallel scsi i o technology 
there can be no assurance that such technology will not be adopted as an industry standard and if an alternative standard is adopted  there can be no assurance the company will timely develop products for such standard 
further  even if fibre channel is adopted  there can be no assurance that the company s integrated pci to fibre channel controller will be fully developed in time to be accepted for use in fibre channel technology or that  if developed  will achieve market acceptance  or be capable of being manufactured at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
in the event that fibre channel is not adopted as an industry standard  or that the company s integrated circuit pci to fibre channel controllers are not timely developed or do not gain market acceptance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the computer industry is characterized by various standards and protocols that evolve with time 
the company s current products are designed to conform to certain industry standards and protocols such as ide  scsi  ultra scsi  ultra scsi  ultra scsi and pci 
in addition  the company s fibre channel products have been designed to conform to a standard that has yet to be uniformly adopted 
the company s products must be designed to operate effectively with a variety of hardware and software products supplied by other manufacturers  including microprocessors  operating system software and peripherals 
the company depends on significant cooperation with these manufacturers in order to achieve its design objectives and produce products that interoperate successfully 
while the company believes that it generally has good relationships with leading microprocessor  systems and peripheral suppliers  there can be no assurance that such suppliers will not from time to time make it more difficult for the company to design its products for successful interoperability 
if industry acceptance of these standards was to decline or if they were replaced with new standards  and if the company did not anticipate these changes and develop new products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the company could experience delays in product development that are common in the computer and semiconductor industry 
significant delays in product development and release would adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will respond effectively to technological changes  new product announcements by other companies or that the company s research and development efforts will be successful 
furthermore  introduction of new products and moving production of existing products to different suppliers involves substantial business risks because of the possibility of product bugs or performance problems  in which event the company could experience significant product returns  warranty expenses and expedite charges  in addition to lower sales and lower profits 
identification and integration of acquisitions the company anticipates that its future growth may depend in part on its ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with those of the company 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including identifying and pursuing acquisitions  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which the company has no or limited direct prior experience  the potential loss of current customers and or retention of the acquired company s customers and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will be realized 
there can be no assurance that the company will be effective in identifying and effecting attractive acquisitions  assimilating acquisitions or managing future growth 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance s of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or stock price 
with respect to recording future business combinations the fasb has announced it may abolish the pooling of interests accounting treatment as well as the accounting treatment of acquired in process research and development 
the proposal would effect transactions after january  if the fasb does eliminate pooling of interests accounting treatment  the company s ability to consummate a business combination without incurring goodwill  would be adversely effected 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success is highly dependent on the continued services of its key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers  and its ability to identify and hire additional personnel 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the market for key personnel in the industries in which it competes is highly competitive 
in particular  periodically the company has experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipates that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future  or to manage the company s business  both in the united states and abroad 
risks of doing business in international markets the company expects that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company is subject to several risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering its business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
a significant amount of the company s customers and suppliers are located in japan 
recently  the asian markets have suffered property price deflation 
this asset deflation has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets 
these deflationary pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with spare industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
the company s export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of the company s foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of the company s products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
lack of significant patent protection  infringement risks although the company has patent protection on certain aspects of its technology in certain jurisdictions  it relies primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect its proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that the company can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents the company possesses will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
the failure of the company to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has experienced intellectual property claims being made against it in the past 
there can be no assurance that patent or other intellectual property infringement claims will not be asserted against the company or its suppliers in the future 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and there can be no assurance that necessary licenses or similar arrangements would be available to the company on satisfactory terms or at all 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling certain of its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  should the company decide to  or be forced to  litigate such claims  such litigation could be expensive and time consuming  could divert management s attention from other matters or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the outcome of the litigation

year the information provided below constitutes a year readiness disclosure for purposes of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century

the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems  customer services  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and products 
the company has initially assessed how it may be impacted by year and has formulated and commenced implementation of a comprehensive plan to address certain aspects of the year problem 
the potential impacts to the company identified by the plan include internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems  including embedded technology  the company s products  and the readiness of significant third parties with whom the company has material relationships 
internal it systems

material third party relationships 
the company s material third party suppliers include key suppliers  contract manufacturers  vendors and business partners 
the process for evaluating third party risk includes the following steps distribution of an initial readiness assessment  if necessary  a comprehensive risk assessment combined with telephone or on site interviews  and preparing contingency plans based on the assessed risk for each third party relationship 
the company has received responses from its initial readiness assessment and is distributing secondary assessments and conducting necessary interviews 
the assessment and interview phase is expected to be completed by july   and contingency plans finalized by september  the company currently estimates that the costs associated with the year should not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company in any given year 
historical amounts spent on assessment  planning  preparation and implementation have not been material to the results of operations 
the company believes its greatest risks related to the year issue involve its relationships with its critical third party suppliers and service providers 
potential impacts to the company include an interrupted product flow from critical suppliers due to their year interruptions  supplier allocation or limiting products and or sub assemblies due to unforeseen product shortages  potential infrastructure collapse such as interruptions in public utilities  electricity or telecommunications 
any of the foregoing risks  as well as the fruition of a combination of lesser risks  could adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
contingency plans to mitigate or reduce these risks are being formulated to address each area of the company s year compliance plan  and are expected to be completed by september  however  as many of the third party service providers such as the public utilities are outside of the company s control  there can be no assurance that a material adverse impact to the company s financial condition or results of operations would not occur 
volatility of stock price the market price of the common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
future announcements concerning the company or its competitors or customers  quarterly variations in operating results  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions for high technology stocks in general  the potential for a shareholder lawsuit  or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
potential effect of anti takeover provisions pursuant to the company s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  the board of directors is authorized to approve the issuance of shares of currently undesignated preferred stock  to determine the price  powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed on any unissued series of the preferred stock  and to fix the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation of such series  without any vote or future action by the stockholders 
pursuant to this authority  the board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the company s common stock 
concurrently with the february two for one stock split  each pre split share was adjusted to one half right per share of common stock 
the shareholder rights plan  the undesignated preferred stock and certain provisions of the delaware law may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for the company s common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock
