our revenues consist primarily of two categories 
product revenues are derived primarily from sales of our protein a products 
research and development revenue is revenue relating to drug discovery collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical partners  licensing revenue  and revenue generated from a phase ii small business innovation research sbir grant from the national institute of health 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were  as compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  research and development revenues for fiscal totaled  including revenues relating to drug discovery collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical partners  licensing revenue  and revenue generated from a phase ii small business innovation research sbir grant from the national institutes of health 
the increase in research and development revenues of  or from fiscal levels is primarily attributable to licensing payments relating to intellectual property rights licensed to neocrin  co 
during fiscal this licensing payment accounted for more than of total revenues 
research and development revenue accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal product revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in the product sales volume is attributed to a decrease in sales of reagent products offset by the increase in sales of protein a 
sales of protein a products accounted for of our revenues in fiscal investment income for fiscal was  a decrease of  from  for fiscal this decrease in investment income was due primarily to the sale of non investment securities held by repligen offset by higher average funds available for investment during fiscal other revenues for the fiscal period decreased by approximately  from the comparable fiscal period  due in large part  to the one time sale of equipment and furnishings by repligen 
expenses 
during fiscal  total expenses were  significantly higher than fiscal expenses of  higher level of expenses in fiscal was largely due to the  charge associated with repligen s acquisition of the rights to certain patent applications for the use of secretin in the treatment of autism 
research and development expenses for fiscal  totaled  an increase of  or  from fiscal levels due to an increase in both personnel and laboratory expenses associated with the expansion of repligen s research and development program 
repligen anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase significantly as repligen increases its investment in its drug development programs during fiscal cost of product sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  from the prior fiscal year 
cost of product sales in fiscal were of product revenues versus of product revenues for fiscal this increase is largely attributable to a write off of certain obsolete raw materials and work in process resulting from the introduction of a new protein a product in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  an increase from fiscal of  this increase is attributable to a noncash charge associated with the issuance of warrants for legal services related to repligen s complaint filed against bristol myers squibb 
in addition  repligen incurred increased expenses relating to legal and shareholder services as repligen sought additional financing 
in march  repligen acquired all rights to certain patent applications covering the use of secretin in the treatment of autism 
the rights were acquired pursuant to a patent purchase agreement 
in addition  repligen agreed to make certain milestone payments upon a repligen s filing of a new drug application with the united states food and drug administration for a clinical indication covered by the intellectual property rights transferred by the patent purchase agreement and b the approval by the fda of a product covered by the intellectual property rights transferred to repligen pursuant to the patent purchase agreement 
finally  repligen agreed to pay certain royalty payments if repligen is able to derive sales and or licensing revenues from the intellectual property rights acquired pursuant to the patent purchase agreement 
under terms of the patent purchase agreement  repligen may be required to repurchase up to a maximum of  shares of common stock issued in connection with the patent purchase agreement at a price of per share 
this obligation to repurchase the common stock expires in june approximately  was charged to the accompanying statement of operations as the cost of the purchased patent rights

the reduction in research and development revenues of  or from fiscal levels is primarily attributable to the termination of its collaborations with eli lilly and company and repligen clinical partners  lp product revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal the decrease of  in the product sales volume is largely attributed to the timing of large production scale orders of protein a offset by an increase in sales of reagent products 
investment income decreased by  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal and was due primarily to lower average funds available for investment during fiscal other revenues for the fiscal of  decreased by approximately  from the comparable fiscal other revenue of  and was primarily due to a restructuring of repligen  pursuant to which repligen made a one time sale of equipment and furnishings for  and the one time sale of non investment securities for approximately  as part of the restructuring 
expenses 
during fiscal  total expenses of  were significantly lower than fiscal expenses of  a decrease of  or from fiscal the higher level of expenses in fiscal was primarily a result of expenditures associated with repligen s former facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
research and development expenses for fiscal  totaling  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal cost of product sales decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal cost of product sales in fiscal were of product revenues versus of product revenues for fiscal the decrease in the cost of product sales is the result of a change in the product mix between fiscal years and the result of the realization of inventory in fiscal that had been reserved for in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease from fiscal of  this decrease is a result of repligen s restructuring efforts that took place during fiscal and as a result of repligen s relocation to smaller office and laboratory space  repligen realized savings in rent and related facility costs 
in addition  this decrease in expenses is a result of the reduction of administrative personnel and related expenses that took place during fiscal in the year ended march   repligen acquired  in exchange for repligen s common stock  all of the outstanding shares of proscure  inc  a subsidiary of glycan pharmaceuticals  inc proscure has licensed the rights to certain drug discovery technologies and lead compounds for application to the field of cancer from glycan  a wholly owned subsidiary of repligen 
since the technology acquired will require further development by repligen  this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  with the excess of the purchase price and acquisition costs over the fair value of the assets acquired of approximately  charged to operations 
liquidity and capital resources repligen s total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to  at march  from  at march  this decrease is primarily attributable to the operating loss incurred in the year ended march  of approximately  in addition  this decrease is attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of  partially offset by an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses of  working capital decreased by  to  at march  from  at march  due to cash outlays to fund operating losses  the purchase of equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  and an increase in accounts receivable outstanding at the end of fiscal year offset by an increase accounts payable and accrued expenses 
capital expenditures for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures in both fiscal and fiscal reflect leasehold improvements and the purchase of research and development and manufacturing equipment 
repligen entered into agreements with a number of collaborative partners and licenses 
under the terms of these agreements  repligen may be eligible to receive research support  additional milestones or royalty revenue if these collaborations continue to clinical evaluation and commercialization 
repligen can not be assured to the continuation of these collaborations or any future payments 
repligen has funded operations primarily with cash derived from the sales of its equity securities  revenue derived from research and development contracts  product sales and investment income 
in april and may  certain investors entered into binding common stock purchase agreements to purchase from repligen an aggregate of  shares of common stock of repligen for an aggregate purchase price of  in a private placement transaction 
the transactions closed during june and repligen filed a registration statement to effect the registration for resale of the  shares purchased by the investors pursuant to the common stock purchase agreements 
while repligen anticipates that the cost of operations will increase in fiscal as it continues to expand its investment in proprietary product development  repligen believes that the private placement financing yielding an aggregate of  in gross proceeds to repligen before related transactional expenses will provide sufficient funding to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twenty four months 
should repligen need to secure additional financing to meet its future liquidity requirements  repligen may not be able to secure such financing  or if repligen does secure  such financing  repligen may not be able to obtain favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology workplace 
year repligen has undertaken an initial review of its information technology computer systems and it believes that the year problem does not pose significant operational problems to its information technology systems 
the majority of repligen s software and computer equipment has been purchased within the last five years from third party vendors who have already provided upgrades intended to bring their products into year compliance 
repligen has begun to address the small number of internal systems that are not yet year compliant  and expects full compliance by the end of repligen currently believes that the costs of addressing these issues should not exceed  and will not have a material adverse impact on repligen s financial position 
repligen has recently begun interviewing various third parties  including vendors and suppliers of repligen  to determine their exposure to year issues  their anticipated risks and responses to those risks 
to date  the third parties that have been contacted have indicated that their hardware or software is or will be year compliant in a time frame that meets repligen s requirements 
even with the vendor compliance however  repligen intends to continue to assess its exposure to year noncompliance on the part of any of its material vendors 
repligen cannot be certain that the vendor s systems will be year compliant in a time frame satisfactory to us 
repligen does not have a contingency plan in the event year compliance cannot be achieved in a timely manner 
a contingency plan will be developed immediately upon completion of repligen s year compliance assessment
