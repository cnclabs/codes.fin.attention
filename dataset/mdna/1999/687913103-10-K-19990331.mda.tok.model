based upon information provided by the allied practices  and based upon the results of operations in and  the company expects an increase in new patient volume during the summer months when children are not in school 
the company also expects the lowest volume of patient starts during the christmas holiday season when children are on vacation and when many of the allied practices are closed 
since the company recognizes of all patients contracts as revenue in the month treatment begins  the company expects higher patient revenue in the third quarter and lower patient revenue in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  the company should see an increase or decrease in service fee revenue during these periods

year compliance the year issue arose as a result of certain computer hardware and software using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  some of the company s hardware and software systems have date sensitive software or embedded chips which may incorrectly recognize a date using rather than the year or not recognize the year at all 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations 
corporate office the company has performed a comprehensive year evaluation of the hardware and software systems utilized by the corporate office in all areas of office automation  including payroll  payables  general ledger and data management 
as far as can be determined  all computer network systems are in full compliance 
necessary certificates of compliance have been obtained from hardware and software vendors 
in the event the company fails to identify all of the systems at risk for possible failure due to the year issue  the company plans to retain a complete backup of the systems and data in use prior to december  if  after the company begins operations in the year  it is determined that a system has failed  the company can reset all system clocks to a date prior to january  and restore the affected systems from the copy 
this will provide the company with more time to repair the affected systems 
the company has requested year compliance certificates from its material third parties 
the company received compliance certificates from approximately of such requests 
the company will verify the status of the remaining material third parties through follow up requests 
the company is uncertain whether the risks of non year compliance by material third parties will materially affect the company s operations or financial position 
the company has determined it is not substantially reliant on any one vendor and expects to use alternate resources in order to continue daily operations 
there can be no assurance that material third parties will not suffer a year business disruptions which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the corporate office does not have any non it systems that might be affected by the year issue 
as an example  the company does not own any automated machinery  elevators  telephone switches  or other equipment that might contain micro controllers 
therefore  the company does not believe that it is at risk from any failure associated with these kinds of devices 
because the company started operations in august  most of the corporate office systems were already year compliant 
accordingly  any costs associated with year upgrades  including fiscal year and year to date as of march  have not been significant 
additionally  the company does not expect to incur any significant costs in the future 
allied practice locations the company has completed a survey of all practice hardware and software to identify non compliant systems and to make the necessary recommendations for achieving compliance 
the company is currently advising the allied practices to install upgrades and replace hardware and software as necessary 
the allied practices are contractually responsible to reimburse the company for any costs the company incurs to upgrade its hardware and software  whether owned by themselves or the company 
the company believes that the significant systems that may impact the allied practice s operations are the practice management and billing system and the accounts payable system 
in the event that the allied practices have not upgraded or replaced their hardware  software or non it devices  the company believes that the impact on allied practice operations would be minimal 
in the event that these systems are not year compliant  certain procedures can be utilized to minimize the affect on practice operations 
these procedures may include the following manual billings  manual posting of payments to patient records and manual preparation of vendor payments 
although additional staffing may be necessary to perform these tasks without the benefit of the affected automated systems  these functions are not critical to providing orthodontic or pediatric dental services 
additionally  the company plans to advise the allied practice to have a contingency plan  including a complete backup of all systems and data prior to december  if the allied practices determine that a system has failed after operations commence in the year  they can reset all system clocks to a date prior to january  and restore the affected systems from the backup 
this will provide the allied practice with more time to repair the affected systems 
the company has advised the allied practices to request year compliance certificates from their key material third parties 
the company is uncertain whether the risks of non year compliance by third parties of the allied practices will materially affect the company s operations or financial position 
the company has determined that the allied practices are not substantially reliant on any one third party and expects them to use alternate resources if necessary to continue daily operations 
the company may own some non it systems in practice offices that might be affected by the year issue 
the company has not yet determined which offices may contain such devices 
the company has advised each allied practice to evaluate all equipment to determine if any such devices exist 
in the event that some of the allied practices have not upgraded their significant non it systems  such as x ray and imaging machines  the allied practices can outsource the procedures in order to continue its daily operations 
the allied practices are contractually responsible to reimburse the company for any costs the company incurs to repair or replace any non compliant devices  whether owned by themselves or the company 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes disclosure requirements related to the reporting of comprehensive income and its components 
the company did not have any comprehensive income for the years ended december  and and for the period from october  to december  effective january   the company implemented sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this standard establishes disclosure requirements related to the reporting of the company s operating segments 
as of december   the company does not have any reportable segments 
the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board issued its consensus opinion eitf  which addresses certain specific matters pertaining to the physician  dentistry and veterinary practice management industries 
eitf became effective for the company for its year ending december  eitf addresses the ability of certain practice management companies to consolidate the results of certain practices with which it has an existing contractual relationship 
the company currently does not consolidate the operations of the practices that it manages 
the guidance in eitf did not change the company s accounting method because the company s arrangements with its allied practices do not meet the requirements for consolidation as set forth in eitf in  the company will implement sop reporting on costs of start up activities 
the sop requires net costs of start up activities  including organizational costs  to be expensed as incurred 
in addition  the sop requires that previously capitalized start up costs be expensed upon the effective date 
the company does not have any start up costs capitalized as of december  item a
