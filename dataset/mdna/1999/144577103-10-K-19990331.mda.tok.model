item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company began operations in september and initially focused on the acquisition of producing properties 
as a result of the increasing availability of economic onshore d seismic surveys  the company began to obtain d seismic data and options to lease substantial acreage in and began to drill its d based prospects in the company drilled  and wells in  and respectively 
the company has budgeted to drill a range of between to gross wells to net in  however  in order to drill more than the minimum expected number of wells the company will need to obtain additional financing and the actual number of wells drilled will vary depending upon the company s ability to obtain this financing  weather delays and other factors 
if the company drills the number of wells it has budgeted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization are expected to decrease and oil and gas operating expenses are expected to increase over levels incurred in the company has typically retained the majority of its interests in shallow  normally pressured prospects and sold a portion of its interests in deeper  over pressured prospects 
the financial statements set forth herein are prepared on the basis of a combination of carrizo and the entities that were a party to the combination transactions 
carrizo and the entities combined with it in the combination transactions were not required to pay federal income taxes due to their status as partnerships or subchapter s corporations  which are not subject to federal income taxation 
instead  taxes for such periods were paid by the shareholders and partners of such entities 
on may   carrizo terminated its status as an s corporation and thereafter became subject to federal income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company established a deferred tax liability in the second quarter of resulting in a noncash charge to income of approximately million 
the company has primarily grown through the internal development of properties within its exploration project areas  although the company acquired properties with existing production in the camp hill project in late  the encinitas project in early and the la rosa project in the company made these acquisitions through the use of limited partnerships with carrizo or carrizo production  inc as the general partner 
in addition  in november the company acquired assets in wharton county  texas in the jones branch project area for approximately  prior to the offering  carrizo conducted its oil and natural gas operations directly  with industry partners and through the following affiliated entities carrizo production  inc  encinitas partners ltd  la rosa partners ltd  carrizo partners ltd 
and placedo partners ltd 
concurrently with the closing of the offering  combination transactions were closed 
the combination transactions consisted of the following i carrizo production  inc merged into carrizo  ii carrizo acquired encinitas partners ltd 
in two steps a carrizo acquired the limited partner interests in encinitas partners ltd 
held by certain of the company s directors and b encinitas partners ltd 
merged into carrizo  iii la rosa partners ltd 
merged into carrizo  and iv carrizo partners ltd 
merged into carrizo 
as a result of the merger of carrizo and carrizo partners ltd  carrizo became the owner of all of the partnership interest in placedo partners ltd 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
to the extent that such capitalized costs in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
at december   the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of million primarily as a result of declines in product pricing and revisions to prior estimates of proved reserves 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
oil and natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last year 
average prices at december  were per bbl for oil and per mcf for natural gas excluding the effect of hedging 
continued product pricing at these levels or any decrease in pricing could continue to adversely effect the company  and the company could be required to make additional charges to earnings related to its oil and gas properties 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for decreased to million from million in production volumes for natural gas in decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf in average natural gas prices decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in production volumes for oil in increased to mbbls from mbbls in average oil prices decreased to per barrel in from per barrel in the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate mbbls natural gas mmcf   average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf operating revenues oil and condensate    natural gas    total    including impact of hedging

per mcfe in the per unit cost increased primarily as a result of decreased production of natural gas as wells naturally decline 
dd a expense for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the increased production  additional land  seismic and drilling costs 
primarily as a result of quantity revisions and depressed commodity prices  the company recorded a write down of oil and gas properties of million in the company had not previously been required to record any such write downs 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from million for reflecting ramp up expenses relating to the hiring of additional technical and administrative staff to handle the company s increased level of exploration activities and operations as well as other costs related to being a public company 
interest expense for decreased to  from  in this decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense in which allowed a larger percentage of the interest to be capitalized 
as a result of the adoption of sfas in the second quarter of  the company recorded a one time non cash charge to income of million to establish a deferred tax liability 
dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock increased to million in from none in as a result of the sale of preferred stock in the first quarter of net income for decreased to a loss of million from income of  in as a result of the factors described above

oil and natural gas operating expenses for decreased to million from million in oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost reductions in older wells and the addition of lower cost production in new oil and gas wells drilled and completed since december  operating expenses per equivalent unit in decreased to 
per mcfe from per mcfe in the per unit cost decreased as a result of increased production of natural gas  which had lower per unit operating costs 
dd a expense for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the increased production  additional seismic and drilling costs and depreciation on d computer equipment and related software 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from  for reflecting ramp up expenses relating to the hiring of additional technical and administrative staff to handle the company s increased level of drilling and operations  and expenses related to the initial public offering 
interest expense for increased to  from  in this increase was primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures and related debt levels in anticipation of the initial public offering 
net income for decreased to  from million in as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources note to the financial statements notes that the financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern but also notes the uncertainties about the company s future ability to pay its obligations when they become due and the lack of firm commitments for additional capital raised substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
as noted in that paragraph  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
see note to the notes to the company s financial statements 
the company has made and will be required to make oil and gas capital expenditures substantially in excess of its net cash flow from operations in order to complete the exploration and development of its existing properties 
the company will require additional sources of financing to fund drilling expenditures on properties currently owned by the company and to fund leasehold costs and geological and geophysical cost on its active exploration projects 
management of the company continues to seek financing for its capital program from a variety of sources 
the company is seeking common or preferred equity investors 
the company is also seeking additional debt financing  although it has no additional borrowings currently available under its credit agreement 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain additional financing by these or other means on terms that would be acceptable to the company 
the company s inability to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on the company 
without raising additional capital  the company anticipates that it will be required to limit or defer its planned oil and gas exploration and development program  which could adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the company may also be required to pursue other financial alternatives  which could include sales of assets or a sale or merger of the company 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have included proceeds from the offering and from the sale of shares of preferred stock and the warrants  funds generated by operations  equity capital contributions and borrowings  primarily under revolving credit facilities 
cash flows provided by operations after changes in working capital were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable relating to joint interest billings and prepayments on upcoming outside operated drilling projects 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to decreases in commodity prices 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures in of approximately million to million of which  is expected to be used to fund d seismic surveys and land acquisitions and million to million of which is expected to be used for drilling activities in the company s project areas 
the company budgeted to drill approximately to gross wells to net in the actual number of wells drilled and capital expended is dependent upon available financing and cash flow 
this decrease in planned drilling activity resulted primarily from the lack of availability of capital resources 
the company has continued to reinvest a substantial portion of its cash flows into increasing its d prospect portfolio  improving its d seismic interpretation technology and funding its drilling program 
oil and gas capital expenditures were million  and million for  and  respectively 
the company s drilling efforts resulted in the successful completion of gross wells net in  gross wells net in and gross wells net in financing arrangements in connection with the offering  the company entered into an amended revolving credit agreement with compass bank the company credit facility  to provide for a maximum loan amount of million  subject to borrowing base limitations 
under the company credit facility  the principal outstanding is due and payable upon maturity in june with interest due monthly 
the company credit facility was subsequently amended in september to provide for a term loan under the facility the term loan in addition to the revolving credit facility limited by the company s borrowing base 
the term loan was initially due and payable upon maturity in september the interest rate for borrowings is calculated at a floating rate based on the compass index rate or libor plus percent 
the company s obligations are secured by certain of its oil and gas properties and cash or cash equivalents included in the borrowing base 
under the company credit facility  compass  in its sole discretion  will make semiannual borrowing base determinations based upon the proved oil and natural gas properties of the company 
compass may redetermine the borrowing base and the monthly borrowing base reduction at any time and from time to time 
the company may also request borrowing base redeterminations in addition to its required semiannual reviews at the company s cost 
as of december   the borrowing base was  and borrowings outstanding were  proceeds from the borrowing base portions of this credit facility have been used to provide funding for exploration and development activity 
substantially all of carrizo s oil and natural gas property and equipment is pledged as collateral under this facility 
at december   and  borrowings under this facility totaled  and  respectively  with an additional  and  respectively  available for future borrowings 
borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the facility were zero and  at december  and  respectively 
the facility was also available for letters of credit  one of which has been issued for  at december  and the weighted average interest rates for and on the facility were and percent  respectively 
outstanding borrowings at december  were repaid with the proceeds of the company s preferred stock sale see note 
the term loan is guaranteed by certain members of the board of directors 
the company is subject to certain covenants under the terms of the company credit facility  including  but not limited to  a maintenance of specified tangible net worth and b maintenance of a ratio of quarterly cash flow net income plus depreciation and other noncash charges  less noncash income to quarterly debt service payments made for principal in connection with the credit facility plus payments made for principal other than in connection with such credit facility of no less than to 
the company credit facility also places restrictions on  among other things  a incurring additional indebtedness  loans and liens  b changing the nature of business or business structure  c selling assets and d paying dividends 
in march  the company credit facility was amended to decrease the required specified tangible net worth covenant 
in december  the company and compass entered into an amendment to the company credit facility that provides for a term loan of million 
interest for borrowings under the term loan was calculated at a floating rate based on the company s index rate plus percent 
the amount outstanding under the term loan as of december  was million  which was repaid in january in march  the company borrowed an additional million on the term loan portion of the company credit facility increasing the total outstanding borrowing under the term loan to million 
certain members of the board of directors have guaranteed the term loan 
the maturity date of the term loan was amended to provide for twelve monthly installments of  beginning january  the company also received a deferral of principal payments due under the borrowing base facility until july  at such time  the available borrowing base portion of the loan will be reviewed and is expected to begin to reduce ratably at  per month with any difference between the available borrowing base and amounts outstanding being currently due 
should the company be able to add sufficient value to its borrowing base through drilling activities  the required principal payments would be reduced 
certain members of the board of directors have provided million in collateral primarily in the form of marketable securities to secure the borrowing base facility 
in january  the company consummated the sale of  shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to affiliates of enron corp 
the net proceeds received by the company from this transaction were approximately million and were used primarily for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in texas and louisiana and to repay related indebtedness 
the preferred stock provides for annual cumulative dividends of per share  payable quarterly in cash or  at the option of the company until january   in additional shares of preferred stock 
the company expects to continue pik dividends due in dividend payments for the months ended december  were made by the issuance of an additional  shares of preferred stock 
as of january  there were  shares of preferred stock outstanding 
the preferred stock is required to be redeemed by the company i on january   or ii after a request for redemption from the holders of at least  shares of the preferred stock or  if fewer than such number of shares of preferred stock are outstanding  all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock and the occurrence of the following events a the company has failed at any point in time to declare and pay any two dividends in the amount then due and payable on or before the date the second of such dividends is due and such dividends remain unpaid at such time  b the company breaches certain other covenants concerning the payment of dividends or other distributions on or redemption or acquisition of shares of its capital stock ranking at parity with or junior to the preferred stock  c for two consecutive fiscal quarterly periods the quarterly cash flow as defined below of the company is less than the amount of the dividends accrued in respect to the preferred stock  d the company fails to pay certain amounts due on indebtedness for borrowed money or there has otherwise been an acceleration of such indebtedness for borrowed money  e there is a violation of the shareholders agreement that is not waived or f the company sells  leases  exchanges or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property and assets which transaction does not provide for the redemption of the series a preferred stock 
cash flow means net income prior to preferred dividends and accretion i plus to the extent included in net income prior to preferred dividends and accretion depreciation  depletion and amortization and other non cash charges and losses on the sale of property ii minus non cash income items and required principal payments on indebtedness for borrowed money with a maturity from the original date of incurrence of such indebtedness of six months or greater excluding voluntary prepayments and refinancing  but including prepayments other than in connection with refinancing which would otherwise be due under such indebtedness within a day period following the date of such prepayment 
the preferred stock also may be redeemed at the option of the company at any time in whole or in part 
all redemptions are at a price per share  together with dividends accumulated and unpaid to the date of redemption  decreasing over time from an initial rate of per share to per share 
if the company fails to meet its redemption obligations  the holders of the preferred stock will generally have the right  voting separately as a class  to elect additional directors  which in most cases will constitute a majority of the board 
the company currently expects that its cash flow as defined above for the three months ended march  will be less than the amount of the dividends accrued with respect to the preferred stock for such period 
there can be no assurance as to whether the company s cash flow for the three months ended june  will exceed the amount of the dividends to be accrued with respect to the preferred stock 
effects of inflation and changes in price 
the company s results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and gas prices 
if the price of oil and gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in the operating cost that the company is required to bear for operations  as well as an increase decrease in revenues 
inflation has had a minimal effect on the company 
ability to manage growth and achieve business strategy the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
the company has relied in the past and expects to continue to rely on project partners and independent contractors that have provided the company with seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services 
at december   the company had full time employees 
there will be additional demands on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources and continued reliance by the company on project partners and independent contractors  and these strains on resources  additional demands and continued reliance may negatively affect the company 
the company s ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors  including its ability to obtain leases or options on properties for d seismic surveys  its ability to acquire additional d seismic data  its ability to identify and acquire new exploratory sites  its ability to develop existing sites  its ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  its ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of its drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  access to capital and other factors 
although the company intends to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources and to increase its ability to provide internally certain of the services previously provided by outside sources  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so or that it will be able to continue to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
the failure of the company to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties  including difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to enable the company to expand its seismic data acquisition and drilling program  or the reduced availability of project partners and independent contractors that have historically provided the company seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has only limited experience operating and managing field operations  and there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in doing so 
any increase in the company s activities as an operator will increase its exposure to operating hazards 
see business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
the company s lack of capital will also constrain its ability to grow and achieve its business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving growth or any other aspect of its business strategy

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement the statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance 
statement no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
statement no 
must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  and  at the company s election  before january  the company routinely enters into financial instrument contracts to hedge price risks associated with the sale of crude oil and natural gas 
statement no 
amends  modifies and supercedes significantly all of the authoritative literature governing the accounting for and disclosure of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
as a result  adoption of statement no 
will impact the accounting for and disclosure of the company s operations 
the company is assessing the impact statement no 
will have on its financial accounting and disclosures and intends to adopt the provisions of such statement in accordance with the requirements provided by the statement

that revised disclosure requirements for pension and other post retirement benefits 
statement no 
does not impact carrizo s disclosure or reporting 
during the first quarter of  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accounts issued two statements of position sop  sop reporting on the costs of start up activities and sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop establishes guidance on the accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company s current accounting policies adhere to the provisions of the sop 
sop provides guidance on the accounting for start up costs and organization costs  and must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december  at adoption  the company will be required to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write off any unamortized start up or organization costs remaining on the balance sheet 
the company plans to adopt the sop in the first quarter of and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of operations 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices the company s revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity  and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company can produce economically 
oil and natural gas prices have declined in the recent past and there can be no assurance that prices will recover or will not decline further 
see business and properties marketing 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of this ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices were depressed for only a short period of time 
the company may be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile 
for example  at december   the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of million because its carrying cost of proved reserves was in excess of the present value of estimated future net revenues from those reserves 
if additional write downs are required  they would result in additional charges to earnings  but would not impact cash flow from operating activities 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
in order to reduce its exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  the company periodically enters into hedging arrangements 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  the company s customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  the company s hedging arrangements limit the benefit to the company of increases in the price of oil and natural gas 
total natural gas purchased and sold under swap arrangements during the years ended december   and was  mmbtu   mmbtu and  mmbtu  respectively 
income and losses realized by the company under such swap arrangements were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company had outstanding no hedge positions as of december  see business and properties marketing 
year the year issue is a general term used to refer to certain business implications of the arrival of the new millennium 
in simple terms  on january   all computerized systems that use the two digit convention to identify the applicable year  including both information technology systems and non information technology systems that use embedded technology  could fail completely or create erroneous data as a result of the system failing to recognize the two digit internal date as representing the year the company has completed its initial assessment of year compliance of its internal information technology systems  which consist primarily of financial and accounting systems and geological evaluation systems  and does not believe that these systems have any material issues with respect to year compliance 
the company s internal information technology systems are all new and widely utilized 
its vendors have advised the company that all of these systems are either year compliant or can be easily upgraded to be year compliant 
the company anticipates that its year remediation efforts for information technology systems  consisting primarily of software upgrades  will continue through  and anticipates incurring less than  in connection with these efforts 
the company has not identified any non information technology systems the use embedded technology on which it relies  however such assessment is expected to continue through through communications with industry partners and others  the company is also evaluating the risk presented by potential year non compliance of third parties 
because such risks vary substantially  companies are being contacted based on the estimated magnitude of the risk posed to the company by their potential year non compliance 
the company anticipates that these efforts will continue through and will not result in significant costs to the company 
the company s assessment of its year issues involves many assumptions 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove accurate  and actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions 
in conducting its year compliance efforts  the company has relied primarily on vendor representations with respect to its internal computerized systems and representations from third parties with which the company has business relationships and has not independently verified these representations 
there can be no assurance that these representations will prove to be accurate 
a year failure could result in a business disruption that adversely affects the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
although it is not currently aware of any likely business disruption  the company is developing contingency plans to address year failures and expects this work to continue through item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate  impact on the company s annual revenues and operating income 
to mitigate some of this risk  the company engages periodically in certain limited hedging activities but only to the extent of buying protection price floors 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
income and losses realized by the company related to these instruments were   and  or  and per mmbtu for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its floating rate debt 
in regards to its revolving credit facility  the result of a fluctuation in short term interest rates would impact cash flow by approximately  financial instruments debt maturities 
the company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to the company for borrowings with similar terms 
current maturities of the debt are  in and  in
