item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business conditions aldila  inc and subsidiaries the company is principally engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
in  the company began production of carbon fiber at its new facility in evanston  wyoming 
the company intends to use the output of this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
it also is producing at this new facility carbon fiber in excess of what it will be able to use in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
the company intends to sell such excess  in some cases in the form of graphite prepreg manufactured using its existing facility in poway  california  as well as chopped carbon fiber to manufacturers of other carbon fiber based products 
the company has not yet realized significant revenues from the sale of carbon fiber or graphite prepreg to third parties through the end of management of the company believes that the ability to manufacture carbon fiber will ultimately enable the company to diversify its sales and reduce its dependence on the overall golf club market  while continuing to leverage the company s existing composite materials expertise 
the new facility underwent a shakedown period in and therefore did not operate at full capability during the year 
management does not expect to operate the plant at full capacity in due to the weak demand for carbon fiber 
the full benefit of this facility to the company is not expected to be realized until the demand for the company s carbon fiber increases which will allow the company to produce at increased volume levels resulting in lower production costs 
historically  graphite shafts have principally been offered by manufacturers of higher priced  premium golf clubs  and the company s sales have been predominantly of premium graphite shafts 
however  in recent years the company has realized substantial sales growth in the value priced segment of the graphite shaft market 
the company now competes aggressively with primarily united states based shaft manufacturers for premium graphite shafts and also against primarily foreign based shaft manufacturers for lower priced value shaft sales 
the company continues to maintain a broad customer base in the premium shaft market segment 
while the company s market share in the value segment is not as great as the premium segment  the company has advanced rapidly in securing new customers in this segment in recent years 
presently  there exists substantial excess graphite shaft manufacturing capacity both in the united states and in other countries 
this has had the effect  and is expected by management to continue to have the effect for at least the next several years  of decreasing the selling prices of the company s shafts 
although the company s gross profit margin is being adversely affected by the reduction in selling prices  the adverse effects on gross margin should be mitigated to some extent by efforts being taken by the company to control costs  including obtaining lower prices for its raw materials  manufacturing its own graphite prepreg and increasing the percentage of its shafts being manufactured in countries with lower labor and overhead costs 
in order to increase its capacity to manufacture shafts in a lower cost environment  the company opened a second shaft manufacturing facility in zhuhai  china during the first quarter of in recent years  the company s results of operations have been materially affected on several occasions by dramatic year to year changes in sales to an individual golf club manufacturer customer 
such changes can result either from decisions by the customer to increase or decrease shaft purchases from an alternative supplier or from the traditional volatility in consumer demand for specific clubs 
the company believes that this volatility is likely to continue in the future  particularly as club manufacturers seek to gain competitive advantages through an increased rate of technological innovation in club design 
the company s results will benefit whenever it has an opportunity to supply shafts for the latest hot club and will be adversely affected whenever sales of clubs containing aldila shafts drop dramatically 
in particular  in recent years  a significant portion of the company s sales has tended to be concentrated in one or two customers  thereby making the company s results of operations dependent to a large extent on continued sales to those customers 
in  sales to callaway golf company and taylor made golf represented and  respectively  of the company s total net sales 
the company anticipates that its sales  both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales to these two customers will decline significantly in as compared to if these sales are not replaced with sales to other shaft customers then such decrease could have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company believes that while it will often not be possible to predict  with any certainty  shifts in demand for particular clubs  the company s broad range of club manufacturer customers should reduce in some cases the extent of the impact on the company s financial results 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating results expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill plant consolidation operating income other interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for from million for the prior year 
the increase in net sales was attributable to increased shaft unit sales to the company s club manufacturer customers as well as a million increase in sales of other carbon fiber products in as compared to shaft unit sales increased in as compared to  which was offset by a decrease in the average selling price of shafts sold  as a result of a change in product mix to lower priced value shafts 
based on the overall weak demand for golf clubs experienced in the fourth quarer of and forecast for at least the first half of  the company anticipates its net sales could decline between to in the first half of versus gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in principally as a result of the increase in net sales 
gross profit was negatively impacted in by million in charges against cost of sales related to production ramp up in the new facility in evanston  wyoming million and inventory markdowns on carbon fiber recorded in the fourth quarter of million 
including these charges  the company s gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in before considering these charges  gross profit margin in increased by over the gross profit margin to 
the company anticipates its gross profit margin will be negatively impacted in by the anticipated lower shaft sales volumes forecast for the company and also as the early production quantities of evanston  wyoming produced carbon fiber is relieved from inventories to cost of sales in the form of graphite shaft sales containing carbon fiber produced at relatively higher production costs 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in selling  general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net sales to in as compared to in primarily as a result of lower advertising  promotional and other administrative expenses in compared to the company has reflected plant consolidation charges in million and million in connection with the consolidation of its domestic golf shaft manufacturing operations in rancho bernardo  california into its facility in poway  california

liquidity and capital resources since november  the only indebtedness of the company has been million in senior notes due generally  the company has not required borrowings to finance its operations or provide working capital but in the company will require additional borrowings to support its working capital needs on a short term basis 
the company s million in senior notes require semi annual principal payments of million beginning september  through september  the company has in place a million line of credit facility from a financial institution which is secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
this line of credit facility  which was initially established in march of  was amended in march of and has a maturity date of august  the company did not take advances against the line of credit in  although it did so the first quarter of borrowings under the line of credit bear interest  at the election of the company  at the bank reference rate at december  plus or at the libor rate plus 
the line of credit requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the amended line of credit agreement 
cash including cash equivalents provided by operating activities in was million compared to in this increase resulted principally from the increase in net income and decrease in cash used for working capital items in as compared to the company used million for capital expenditures during  primarily related to the completion of construction of a new facility for the manufacture of carbon fiber and for the new shaft manufacturing facility in china 
other than maintenance capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business which the company does not expect to be significant  the only planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months are in connection with the completion of the new china shaft facility 
management anticipates capital expenditures over the next months to approximate million 
the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s business 
the company could require additional debt financing if it were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
seasonality because the company s customers have historically built inventory in anticipation of purchases by golfers in the spring and summer  the principal selling season for golf equipment  the company s operating results have been affected by seasonal demand for golf clubs  which has generally resulted in highest sales occurring in the second quarter 
the company experienced a substantial shaft unit volume increase in over the previous year which followed a seasonal pattern where sales volume peaked in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
however  based on the overall weak demand for golf clubs experienced in the fourth quarter of and forecast for at least the first half of  the company anticipates its net sales could decline between to in the first half of versus and accordingly  does not anticipate normal seasonal sales trends in year the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by the inability of the company s information systems and the information systems of its major customers and suppliers to process data having dates on or after january  the year issues 
the company has evaluated its information technology it and non it systems  including but not limited to computer hardware and software  alarm systems  manufacturing equipment and software  and all other mechanical equipment  to determine areas of exposure to potential year issues 
based on this evaluation  a plan was developed and implemented to identify and resolve all of the internal year issues 
the company has tested its critical systems and believes them to be year compliant 
however  the company has not completed the testing phase for its non critical systems 
the company believes that it will complete its year plan by the end of the second quarter included in the company s plan is the evaluation of its external year exposure and risks 
the company is still in the process of contacting its major external customers and suppliers to determine their year readiness and evaluate risk factors associated with them 
the possibility exists that the company s manufacturing operations could be affected by external suppliers systems that are not year compliant 
key risk areas identified by the company include its energy suppliers to its facility in evanston  wyoming as well as electrical providers to the company in tijuana  mexico and zhuhai  china 
if one of these providers is not able to provide the necessary requirements to the company  there likely would not be a reasonable alternative available to the company and as a result the company s business could be negatively impacted 
to date  the company has not expended a significant amount in identifying and fixing year issues and estimates it will not incur a significant amount for remediation of its remaining year issues 
total expenditures are not expected to exceed  in addition  based on its efforts to date  the company does not anticipate any significant risk of failure leading to material financial impact resulting from the year issue 
consequently  the company does not intend to create a contingency plan 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to achieve year compliance will be successful or that third parties with whom the company has material relationships will be year compliant by january  an interruption of the company s ability to conduct its business due to a year problem with a third party  such as those noted above  could have an adverse effect on the company
