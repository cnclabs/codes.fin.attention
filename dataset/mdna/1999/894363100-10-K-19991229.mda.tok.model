you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  and continue or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operation or of our future financial condition  or state other forward looking information 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to people that may be interested 
however  unexpected events may arise in the future that we are not able to predict or control 
the risk factors that we describe in this section  as well as any other cautionary language in this report on form k  give examples of the types of uncertainties that may cause our actual performance to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should know that if the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report on form k occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on strong sales in the first half of the year 
our business  and the recreational boating industry in general  is very seasonal 
our strongest sales period begins in january  because many boat and recreation shows are held in that month 
strong sales demand continues from january through the summer months 
of our average annual net sales over the last three years  over occurred in the quarter ending march and over occurred in the quarter ending june with the exception of our store locations in florida  our sales are generally much lower in the quarter ending december because the overall sales level in the december quarter are much less than in the months with warmer weather  we generally do not make a profit in the quarter ending december because of the difference in sales in the warm spring and summer months versus the cold fall and winter months  if our sales in the months of january through june are significantly lower than we expect  we may not earn profits or we may lose money and have a net loss 
this experience may lead to a material adverse effect on our business  our operating results and our financial condition 
see our sales depend on good weather and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our sales depend on good weather 
our business also depends on favorable weather conditions 
for example  too much or too little rain  either of which may result in dangerous or inconvenient boating conditions  can force boating areas to close and severely limit our sales 
a long winter can also reduce our selling season 
hurricanes and other storms could result in the disruption of our operations or result in damage to our inventories and facilities 
we purchase insurance for storm damage  but the amount of insurance purchased or coverages we purchase may not repay us for all weather related damages or disruptions to our operations 
bad weather conditions in the future may decrease customer demand for our boats  which may decrease our sales and could significantly lower the trading price of our common stock 
general economic conditions in the united states and in the areas where we have stores affect our sales 
our industry  like many other retail industries  depends on the local  regional and national economy 
high interest rates  unfavorable economic developments  volatility or declines in the stock market  changes to the tax law such as the imposition of a luxury tax  or a major employer s decision to leave a certain city can all significantly decrease the amount of money consumers are willing to spend 
when these situations arise  consumers often decide not to purchase relatively expensive  luxury items like recreational boats 
for example  from to  our business suffered dramatically because of the declines in the financial  oil and gas and real estate markets in texas 
if similar downturns in the national or in local economies arise in the future  we may suffer significant operating losses 
also  changes in federal and state tax laws  such as the imposition of luxury taxes on new boat purchases also could influence consumers decisions to purchase products we sell and could have a negative effect on our sales 
for example  during and the federal government imposed a luxury tax on new recreational boats with sales prices in excess of  this luxury tax coincided with a sharp decline in boating industry sales from a high of billion in the late s to a low of billion in our growth depends on our ability to acquire and open new stores 
we have grown primarily through the acquisition of recreational boat dealerships 
our growth strategy involves significant risks 
we began with one store in texas in and  since then  have opened or acquired new stores in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  louisiana  mississippi  oklahoma  tennessee and texas 
stores that we acquired or opened since we went public in june of have accounted for of our net sales in fiscal year  of our net sales in fiscal year and of our net sales in fiscal year by comparison  our comparable store sales which are sales in stores that are open in the same location for two consecutive years have increased in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal we expect our comparable store sales to fluctuate from the impact of i when and where we acquire new store locations  ii the number of store locations that we remodel or relocate to superstores  and iii the market conditions in the areas or cities in which our stores are located 
although we expect our existing stores to have sales growth and to remain profitable  most of our sales growth is from newly added store locations and we may not be able to continue to grow or purchase new store locations at the same rapid pace or on terms and conditions favorable to us 
we may continue to make acquisitions depending upon  among other things  the availability of suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to finance these transactions 
our success in these acquisitions will depend on our financial strength at the time of acquisition  our ability to hire and retain qualified employees and our ability to identify markets in which we can successfully sell our products 
in addition  once we identify a store that meets our criteria  our success will depend on our ability to sell the store s remaining inventory  to convert the store to a travis boating center and to attract new customers to the store after the conversion 
our inability to meet our planned growth potential will severely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
besides acquiring existing stores and converting them into travis boating centers  we plan to build new stores in certain cities or towns that do not have other boat retailers that we can purchase or would like to purchase 
our success in building and operating new facilities will depend on whether we obtain reliable information about each potential market  such as how many and what type of boats have previously been sold in the market 
we must then be certain that the prices of our boats are competitive with other boat dealers that sell boats in the market so that we can sell enough boats to operate our store profitably 
we cannot promise or be certain that we will be able to open and operate new stores in a time frame that we are expected to by our shareholders or that we can operate stores on a profitable basis 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth 
we have undergone a period of rapid growth and  consequently  we have spent much time and effort in acquiring and opening new stores 
although we believe that our systems  procedures and controls are adequate to support our growth  we cannot assure that this is the case 
in addition  our growth will impose substantial added responsibilities on our existing senior management including the need to identify  recruit and integrate new senior level managers 
management may not be able to oversee the growth efficiently or to implement effectively our growth and operating strategies 
our inability to manage our growth would result in a significant and severe financial impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are installing a new mis system in each of our stores  which may not operate effectively 
beginning in fiscal year  we purchased and began installing a new management information system to monitor and manage our geographically dispersed stores 
this system is now operational in each of our stores 
we believe that our company is among the first to install this management information system on a large scale  fully centralized network architecture 
accordingly  we are testing the continued application of the system in a large scale multiple user network that will accommodate future growth in the number of store locations we operate 
any faults  defects or networking limitations in this system could harm our ability to operate our stores and would result in a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure of year issues and consequences 
our suppliers could increase the prices they charge us or could decide not sell to us 
we have entered into non exclusive dealer agreements with our key manufacturers 
most of these agreements are renewable each year and contain other conditions that are standard in the industry 
because of our relationship with these manufacturers and the volumes we purchase  we receive volume price discounts and other favorable terms  however  the manufacturers may change the prices they charge us for any reason at any time or could decide not to sell their products to us 
a change in manufacturer s prices or changes in industry regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
we rely on several key manufacturers for almost all of our inventory purchases 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued quality and popularity of the products of our manufacturers 
we purchase almost all of our outboard motors from two manufacturers 
in fiscal years and  we purchased nearly all of the outboard motors we use on our travis edition line of recreational boats from outboard marine corporation  which makes johnson outboard motors 
in fiscal year we also purchased outboard motors from brunswick corporation  which makes mercury outboard motors 
we have three year master agreements with outboard marine corporation and brunswick corporation that provide volume price discounts and reimbursement for certain marketing expenses 
each agreement is currently in the second year 
either of these agreements may be canceled  however  if we do not buy certain minimum quantities or if the manufacturer cannot supply the quantity we need 
cancellation or modification of our agreements to purchase outboard motors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also buy much of our boat inventory from genmar industries  inc  or genmar 
for example  in fiscal year we purchased of our inventory from genmar  in fiscal year we purchased  and in fiscal year we purchased from genmar 
the purchases of boats from this supplier are also made based on the terms of a three year master agreement with volume price discounts 
in addition  we purchase a large percentage of the annual production of several other boat manufacturers 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our sales increase  these key manufacturers may need to increase their production or we may need to locate other sources to purchase outboard motors or boats 
if our suppliers cannot produce more or decide not to renew their contracts with us  and we cannot find alternative sources at similar quality and prices  we would experience inventory shortfalls which  if severe enough  could cause significant disruptions and delays in our sales and  therefore  harm our financial condition 
in addition the timing  structure  and amount of manufacturer sales incentives could impact the timing and profitability of our sales 
certain laws and contracts may keep us from entering new markets 
we may be required to obtain the permission of manufacturers to sell their product before we enter new markets 
we received permission from some key manufacturers  including outboard marine corporation  to sell their product in the areas where we have recently expanded 
we have not  however  received universal approval to sell all of our products in all new markets 
if our manufacturers do not give us permission to sell their products in markets where we plan to expand  we will be forced to find alternative supply sources 
besides these manufacturers restrictions  there are also legal restrictions on our business 
for example  the state of oklahoma has adopted laws that restrict the locations of competing boat dealers 
while these types of laws are not common  they could have a significant effect on our industry if other states pass similar restrictions 
we may not be able to respond effectively to the significant competition we face 
we operate in very competitive conditions 
we must compete generally with other businesses trying to sell discretionary consumer products and also face intense competition from other recreational boat dealers for customers  quality products  store locations and boat show space 
we rely heavily on boat shows to generate sales 
if we are limited in or prevented from participating in boat shows in its markets or in markets we are targeting  this limited participation could have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
within our industry  our main competitors are single location boat dealers 
we compete with other dealers based on the quality of available products  the price and value of the products and customer service 
to a lesser extent  we also compete with national specialty marine stores  catalog retailers  sporting good stores and mass merchants  especially with respect to parts and accessories 
we face significant competition in the markets where we currently operate and in the markets we plan to enter 
we believe that the trend in the boating industry is for manufacturers to include more features as standard equipment on boats and for other dealers to offer packages comparable to our packages 
some of our competitors  especially those that sell boating accessories  are large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to effectively compete in the retail boating industry in the future 
our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 
we have had and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional capital 
our future capital requirements will depend upon the size  timing and the structure of future acquisitions and our working capital 
any borrowings to finance future operations  asset purchases or acquisitions could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results  a downturn in economic conditions or increases in interest rates on portions of debt that have variable interest rates 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements  we could be required to sell additional equity securities  refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements 
in addition  our credit arrangements generally will contain financial and operational covenants and other restrictions with which we must comply 
adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
our failure to achieve required financial and other covenants or to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and prospects 
we may issue additional securities in connection with acquisitions that will dilute our current shareholders and impact our earnings per share 
if we choose to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part through the issuance of common stock or debt instruments convertible into our common stock  our existing shareholders would experience dilution and our earnings per share could also be impacted by the issuance of additional shares of capital stock in connection with future acquisitions 
we are refinancing our credit line and may not obtain favorable terms 
one of our current credit facilities for borrowings of up to million matures on january  we currently are in technical default under this credit facility based upon a financial ratio required under the terms of this facility 
we are currently in the process of refinancing and increasing this credit facility to provide for borrowings of up to million with several financial lenders including certain lenders that currently provide a portion of the million loan 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to complete this refinancing on favorable terms and conditions 
the failure to refinance the million credit facility or to obtain other sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial conditions 
much of our income is from financing  insurance and extended service contracts  which is dependent on third party lenders and insurance companies 
we receive a substantial part of our income from the fees we receive from banks and other lending companies 
we call this type of income finance and insurance income  or f i income 
if our customers desire to borrow money to finance the purchase of their boat  we help the customers obtain the financing by referring them to certain banks that have offered to provide financing for boat purchases 
the bank or other lending company pays a fee to our company for each loan that they are able to provide as a result of our referral 
when we sell boats we also offer our customers the opportunity to purchase i a service contract that generally provides up to four years of additional warranty coverage on their boat s motor after the manufacturer s original warranty expires  and ii various types of insurance policies that will provide money to pay a customer s boat loan if the customer dies or is physically disabled 
we sell these products as a broker for unrelated companies that specialize in these type of issues  and we are paid a fee for each product that we sell 
since we only broker these products on behalf of other providers  our responsibility and or financial risk for paying claims or expenses that are eligible to be insured by these service contracts or other insurance policies is limited 
f i income for fiscal year was of our net sales  and we estimate of our net profits 
in fiscal year  these services accounted for of our net sales and approximately of our net profits 
this arrangement carries several potential risks 
for example  the lenders we arrange financing through may decide to lend to our customers directly rather than to work through us 
if the customer goes directly to the bank to apply for a loan to purchase their boat we would not receive a fee for referral 
second  the lenders we currently refer customers to may change the criteria or terms they use to make loan decisions  which could reduce the number of customers that we can refer 
also  our customers may use the internet or other electronic methods to find financing alternatives 
if either of these events occur  we would lose a significant portion of our income and profit 
our success depends on our management team 
our company depends greatly on our key management  including mark t 
walton  chairman of the board and president  ronnie l 
spradling  executive vice president new store development  michael b 
perrine  chief financial officer  secretary and treasurer  and other key employees 
we have bought and are the beneficiary of key man life insurance policies on mr 
walton and mr 
perrine in the amount of  each  and on mr 
spradling in the amount of  however  if any of these employees or other key employees died  became disabled or left travis boats for other reasons  their loss could have a significant negative effect on our operations and our financial performance 
if our products are defective  we could be sued 
because we sell  service and custom package boats  motors and other boating equipment  we may be exposed to lawsuits for personal injury and property damage if any of our products are defective and cause personal injuries or property damage 
manufacturers that we purchase product from generally maintain product and general liability insurance and we carry third party product liability insurance 
we have avoided any significant liability for these risks in the past 
however  if a situation arises in which a claim is not covered under our insurance policy or is covered under our policy but exceeds the policy limits  it could have a significant and material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our failure and the failure of parties with whom we do business to address their year issues could negatively impact our operating results 
the year issue is the result of computer program being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
if all year issues are not properly identified  or if assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact our financial position or results of operations or adversely affect our relationships with customers  vendors or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on our systems or results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure of year issues and consequences 
our stock price may be volatile 
the price of our common stock may be highly volatile for several reasons 
first  a limited number of shares of our stock are owned by the public 
this may effect trading patterns which generally occur when a greater number of shares are traded 
second  the quarterly variations in our operating results  as discussed above  may result in the increase or decrease of our stock price 
third  independent parties may release information regarding pending legislation  analysts estimates or general economic or market conditions that effect the price of our stock 
also  our stock price may be effected by the demand and the market performance of small capitalization stocks 
any of these situations may have a significant effect on the price of our common stock or our ability to raise additional equity 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if we issue more stock  our stock price may decline 
the sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
as of december   we own or control  together with our officers and directors and large shareholders  approximately  shares of common stock 
our sale of a large portion of these shares may decrease the price of our common stock 
our corporate documents may prevent or inhibit a takeover of the company 
our articles of incorporation permit us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  either all at once or in a series of issuances 
our board of directors has the power to set the terms of this preferred stock 
if we issued this preferred stock  it could delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
also  our articles of incorporation permit the board of directors to determine the number of directors and do not specify a maximum or minimum number 
our bylaws currently provide that the board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms 
this arrangement could delay shareholders from replacing current board members and could delay or prevent a takeover that you may consider to be in your best interest

item business general travis boats motors  inc travis boats or the company is a leading multi state superstore retailer of recreational boats  motors  trailers and related marine accessories in the southern united states 
the company  which currently operates stores under the name travis boating center in texas  arkansas  louisiana  alabama  tennessee  mississippi  florida  georgia and oklahoma  seeks to differentiate itself from competitors by providing customers a unique superstore shopping experience that showcases a broad selection of high quality boats  motors  trailers and related marine accessories at firm  clearly posted low prices 
each superstore also offers complete customer service and support  including in house financing programs and full service repair facilities staffed by factory trained mechanics 
history travis boats was incorporated as a texas corporation in as used herein and unless otherwise required by the context  the terms travis boats and the company shall mean travis boats motors  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
since its founding in as a single retail store in austin  texas  the company has grown both through acquisitions and the establishment of new store locations 
during the s  the company expanded into san antonio  texas with the construction of a new store facility 
the company subsequently made acquisitions of boat retailers operating within the texas markets of midland  dallas and abilene 
it was during this initial period of expansion that the company began developing the systems necessary to manage a multi store operation and leveraging the economies of scale associated with volume purchasing 
the company s success in these areas led to the proprietary travis edition packaging concept and the company s pricing philosophy 
since  travis boats has opened or acquired additional store locations in the following states texas  arkansas  louisiana  alabama  tennessee  mississippi  florida  georgia and oklahoma 
the company sells approximately different travis edition models of brand name fishing  water skiing and general recreational boats  along with motors  trailers  accessories and related equipment 
personal watercraft  off shore fishing boats and cabin cruisers are also offered for sale at selected store locations 
during fiscal  substantially all of the boat units sold range in size from to feet at prices ranging from  to  approximately of new boat sales are personal watercraft with retail prices generally ranging from  to  and approximately of new boat sales are off shore fishing boats and cruisers with lengths of feet or greater and generally ranging in retail price from  to  the company s retail pricing structure seeks to maintain a consistent gross profit percentage for each of its travis edition models 
see business strategy travis edition concept 
the company custom designs and pre packages combinations of popular brand name boats  such as larson  wellcraft  bayliner  sprint  and sea ark boats with outboard motors generally manufactured by outboard marine corporation or brunswick  along with trailers and numerous accessories  under its proprietary travis edition product line 
these signature travis edition packages  which account for the vast majority of total new boat sales  have been designed and developed in coordination with the manufacturers and often include distinguishing features and accessories that have historically been unavailable to  or listed as optional by  many competitors 
these factors enable the company to provide the customer with an exceptional product that is conveniently packaged for immediate enjoyment and competitively priced 
the company believes that it offers a selection of boat  motor and trailer packages that fall within the price range of the majority of all boats  motors and trailers sold in the united states 
the company s product line generally consists of boat packages priced from  to  with approximate even distribution within this price range 
while the company s sales have historically been concentrated on boats with retail sales prices below  the company in limited market areas and quantities does sell boats that have retail sales prices in excess of  additionally  as the company continues to operate in florida and enters other markets along the gulf of mexico or other new coastal areas  management believes that the distribution of off shore fishing boats and cabin cruisers will continue to increase as a percentage of net sales 
management believes that by combining flexible financing arrangements with an even distribution of products through a broad price range  the company is able to offer boat packages to customers with different purchasing budgets and varying income levels 
business strategy the company has developed a multi state  chain superstore merchandising strategy in the recreational boating business 
the company s objective is to continue to grow as one of the dominant retailers of recreational boats  motors  trailers and marine accessories in the southern united states 
as such the company s strategy is to increase its store location count in the southern united states while also maintaining a focus on possible expansion into other regions 
management s merchandising strategy is based on providing customers with a comprehensive selection of quality  brand name boats and boating products in a comfortable superstore environment 
the company intends to continue to build brand identity by placing the travis edition name on complete boating packages 
travis boats has developed and implemented a business strategy designed to increase its market penetration within both existing and new market areas through a variety of advertising and promotional events 
the company intends to emphasize the following key elements of its business strategy travis boating center superstore 
travis boating center superstores have a distinctive and stylish trade dress accented with deep blue awnings  a nautical neon building decoration  expansive glass storefronts and brightly lit interiors 
the stores range in size from approximately  temporary store locations to over  square feet and management estimates the average store size at approximately  square feet 
the superstore locations present customers with a broad array of boats and often over  parts and accessories in a clean  well stocked  air conditioned shopping environment 
all boats are typically displayed fully rigged with motor  trailer and a complete accessory package  giving a ready to take home impression 
professionally trained mechanics operate service bays  providing customers with quality and reliable maintenance and repair service 
travis edition concept 
the company uses extensive market research  combined with the design resources of its manufacturers  to develop custom travis edition boating packages 
the company s significant purchasing power and consequent ability to coordinate designs with manufacturers have enabled the company to obtain products directly from the factory at the lowest prices  with favorable delivery schedules and with distinguishing features and accessories that have historically been unavailable to  or listed as optional by  many competitors 
the company can also add certain additional features after receipt of the product to enhance the company s travis edition packages 
each travis edition is a complete  full feature package  including the boat  motor  trailer and numerous additional accessories and design features often not found on competitors products  thus providing customers with superior value 
these features often may include enhanced styling such as additional exterior colors  complete instrumentation in dashboards  transoms warranted for life  canopy tops  trolling motors  upgraded interiors with stereos  wood grain dashboards  in dash depth finders  stainless steel motor propellers and enhanced hull design not available on other models 
in addition  travis edition boats are generally identified by the company s attractive private label logo as well as the respective manufacturer s logo 
unlike most recreational boat dealers  the company establishes firm prices on its travis edition packages and generally maintains such prices for an entire season 
prices are advertised and clearly posted so that the customer receives the same price at any travis boating center 
the company s selling philosophy is designed to eliminate customer anxiety associated with bargaining or negotiation and result in a price at or below prices generally available from competitors 
the company believes this pricing strategy and low pressure sales style provide the customer with the comfort and confidence of having received a better boat with more features at a lower price 
in the company s view  this approach has promoted good customer relationships and enhanced the company s reputation in the industry as a leading provider of quality and value 
acquisitions 
the company has made various acquisitions during the three year period ended september  all of the acquisitions were asset purchases except for adventure marine and shelby marine  which were stock purchases and have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the operating results of the companies acquired have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective date of acquisition 
the assets acquired generally include boat  motor and trailer inventory  parts and accessories inventory and to a lesser extent  property and equipment

the company also participates in boat shows  typically held in january through march  in each of its markets and in certain markets of close proximity 
these shows are normally held at convention centers  with all area dealers purchasing space to display their respective product offerings 
boat shows and other offsite promotions generate a significant amount of interest in products and often have an immediate impact on sales at a nominal incremental cost 
although total boat show sales are difficult to assess  management attributes a significant portion of the second fiscal quarter s net sales to such shows 
f i products 
in the travis edition boat packages the company offers customers the ability to purchase extended service contracts and insurance coverages  including credit life and accident disability coverages collectively f i products 
the company also offers to assist the customer in obtaining financing for their boat purchase through a diversified group of financial institutions with which the company maintains financing agreements 
the company earns commissions on these f i products based upon the company s mark up over the cost of the products 
f i products account for a substantial portion of the company s income  the most significant component of which is the income resulting from the company s origination of customer financing 
operations purchasing 
the company believes it is among the largest volume buyers of outboard motors in the united states 
until fiscal year  the company purchased substantially all of its outboard motors from outboard marine corporation omc  which is the manufacturer of johnson outboard motors 
beginning with the fiscal year  the company elected to further diversify its outboard motor selection and entered into an agreement to purchase mercury outboard motors from brunswick corporation brunswick 
the company is also among the largest domestic volume buyer of boats from many of the boat manufacturers it represents 
as a result  the company has significant access to the manufacturers and substantial input into the design process for the new boats that are introduced to the market each year by such manufacturers 
in addition  the company has designed and developed  in coordination with its manufacturers  signature travis edition boating packages which account for the vast majority of its total new boat sales 
the company typically deals with each of its manufacturers pursuant to an annually renewable  non exclusive dealer agreement which does not contain any contractual provisions concerning product pricing or purchasing levels 
pricing is generally established on an annual basis  but may be changed at the manufacturer s sole discretion 
the company s agreements with omc and brunswick to purchase outboard motors  as well as its agreements to purchase boats from genmar industries  inc genmar  unlike its other dealer agreements  are multi year in nature 
these current agreements include volume discounts from the then prevailing dealer net price over the entire term of the respective agreement 
this dealers agreement typically may be canceled by either party if volume of product purchased or available to be purchased is not maintained at pre established levels 
approximately and of the company s net purchases in fiscal years and  respectively  were products manufactured by boat manufacturers owned by genmar 
genmar s boat lines purchased by the company include larson  aquasport  wellcraft  scarab  and carver 
omc supplied products that represented approximately million  or  and million  or  of the company s net purchases during fiscal years and  respectively 
brunswick supplied mercury outboard motors that represented approximately million  or  of the company s net purchases during the fiscal year 
the company s right to display some product lines or prices in certain markets  including the internet  may be restricted by arrangements with certain manufacturers 
floor plan and other inventory financing 
the company acquires a substantial portion of its inventory through floor plan and other financing agreements 
inventory is generally purchased under floor plan lines of credit secured by such inventory maintained with third party finance companies or under revolving lines of credit maintained with commercial banks  depending upon the type of product purchased 
the seasonal nature of the recreational boating industry impacts the production schedules of the manufacturer s that produce marine products 
during the fall and winter months  retail sales of recreational boats diminish significantly as compared to sales during the warm spring and summer months 
to provide recreational boating retailers  such as travis boats  extra incentive to purchase boating products in the off season  manufacture s typically offer product for sale at a price that includes an interest subsidy 
since retail boat dealers typically utilize floor plan financing to provide working capital to purchase inventory  the interest subsidy is intended to assist the retail dealer in stocking the product until the selling season 
the terms of the interest subsidy or assistance vary by manufacturer  with substantially all manufacturers in the marine industry offering such programs 
management believes that these financing arrangements are standard within the industry 
as of september   the company and its subsidiaries owed an aggregate of approximately million pursuant to the floor plan and revolving lines of credit 
competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
in addition to facing competition generally from businesses seeking to attract discretionary spending dollars  the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented  resulting in intense competition for customers  access to quality products  access to boat show space in new markets and suitable store locations 
the company relies heavily on boat shows to generate sales 
if the company is impeded in its ability to participate in boat shows in its existing or targeted markets  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company competes primarily with single location or single state boat dealers and  to a lesser degree  with national specialty marine stores  catalog retailers  sporting goods stores and mass merchants  particularly with respect to parts and accessories 
dealer competition  which includes one other publicly traded multi state retailer of recreational boats  continues to increase based on the quality of available products  the price and value of the products and attention to customer service 
there is significant competition both within markets currently being served by the company and in new markets into which the company plans to enter 
while the company generally competes in each of its markets with retailers of brands of boats not sold by the company in that market  it is common for other competitive retailers to sell the same brands of outboard motors 
management believes that a trend in the industry is for independent dealers to attempt to form alliances or buyer s groups  for manufacturers to include more features as standard equipment on boats and consequently  and for competitive dealers to offer packages comparable to those offered by the company as its travis edition lines 
in addition  several of the company s competitors  especially those selling boating accessories  are large national or regional chains that may have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the retail marine industry in the future 
impact of environmental and other regulatory issues 
on october   the us environmental protection agency epa announced proposed emissions regulations for outboard marine motors 
the proposed regulations would require a average reduction in hydrocarbon emissions for outboard motors and set standards for carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions as well 
under the proposed regulations  manufacturers began phasing in low emission models in and had approximately nine years to achieve full compliance 
certain states  such as california  are proposing and adopting legislation that would require low emission outboards and other engines on certain bodies of water or more aggressive schedules than the epa 
the company s primary outboard motor suppliers  outboard marine corporation omc and brunswick each have begun the phase in process for the new epa compliant outboard motors 
however  in fiscal and  the company only purchased minimal quantities of the new epa compliant outboard motors as a result of a lack of supply of the new product since these manufacturers are still in the initial stages of the new product s release 
the company s boat models sold with the new epa compliant outboards in fiscal and generally were priced approximately  higher than those with traditional outboard motors 
management anticipates retail prices to generally be from to  higher for the new epa compliant outboards depending on the motor s horsepower 
management  based upon discussions with omc and brunswick  believes that the higher retail costs will be offset by enhanced fuel efficiency and acceleration speed  as well as reduced maintenance costs of the new epa compliant outboard motors 
costs of comparable new models  if materially more expensive than previous models  or the manufacturer s inability to deliver responsive  fuel efficient outboard motors that comply with epa requirements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company  in the ordinary course of its business  is required to dispose of certain waste products that are regulated by state or federal agencies 
these products include waste motor oil  tires  batteries and certain paints 
it is the company s policy to use appropriately licensed waste disposal firms to handle this refuse 
if there were improper disposal of these products  it could result in potential liability for the company 
although the company does not own or operate any underground petroleum storage tanks  it currently maintains several above ground tanks  which are subject to registration  testing and governmental regulation 
additionally  certain states have required or are considering requiring a license in order to operate a recreational boat or personal watercraft 
while such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive  regulations may discourage potential first time buyers  thereby limiting future sales  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trademarks and service marks 
the company does not hold any registered trade or service marks at this time but has trademark applications pending with the us patent and trademark office for the names travis boating center and travis edition  for its corporate logo and for the overall appearance and trade dress of its travis boating centers 
there can be no assurance that any of these applications will be granted 
however  based on a number of years of use  the company believes it has common law rights to these marks at least in its current market areas 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company has entered into an agreement with a marine dealership operating in knoxville  tennessee not to use the names travis  travis boating center or travis edition in certain types of uses or situations in knoxville  tennessee and a mile radius therefrom

the company also benefited from growth in comparable store sales 
during fiscal year  comparable store sales increased by  or million  stores in base versus  or million  stores in base during fiscal see risk factors our growth depends on our ability to acquire and open new stores 
growth in overall sales volume resulted  in part  from additional new travis edition boating packages introduced during fiscal and these new additions included the pro line and polar brand boats in and wellcraft  bayliner and fishmaster boat models in fiscal  as well as mercury motors in november during fiscal  the company experienced increased parts accessories and service labor sales of and  respectively  primarily through an increased store network

as such  comparable store performance is expected to remain unstable until higher percentages of the company s stores are includable in comparable store calculations 
included within net sales is revenue that the company earns related to f i products 
the company  through relationships with various national and local lenders  is able to place financing for its customers boating purchases 
these lenders allow the company to sell the loan at a rate higher than a minimum rate established by each such lender  and the company earns fees based on the percentage increase in the loan rate over the lender s minimum rate 
the company sells these loans without recourse  except that in certain instances the company must return the fees earned if the customer repays the loan or defaults in the first days 
the company also sells  as a broker  certain types of insurance property casualty  credit life  disability and extended service contracts 
the company may also sell these products at amounts over a minimum established cost and earn income based upon the profit over the minimum established cost 
net sales attributable to f i products increased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal  in fiscal  f i income as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to competitive pressures on finance rates which resulted in lower net spreads achieved in the placement of customer financing  as well as overall decreases in the percentage of customers buying these products which is referred to as sell through  and a reduced demand in certain insurance products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company generally seeks to maintain a gross profit margin of to on its boating packages and is able to further leverage the margin through sales of parts accessories  service labor and f i products  all of which generally produce gross profit margins in excess of 
during fiscal  the company s gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a temporary reduced revenue mix in its boating package margins as a result of acquisition boat inventory that liquidated at below company standard margins  thus  driving the company s new boating package margins down to and used margins down to company standard of 
this  combined with the basis point reduction in high yielding f i income  as a percentage of net sales  caused the basis point drop in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales 
net sales attributable to f i products  which have a significant impact on the gross profit margin  contributed million  or  of total gross profit in fiscal  as compared to million  or  of total gross profit for fiscal net sales attributable to f i products are reported on a net basis and therefore all of such sales contribute directly to the company s gross profit 
the costs associated with the sale of f i products are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased by basis points to in fiscal from for fiscal in absolute dollars  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the operation of a larger store network  growth in the corporate office staffing infrastructure and increased advertising and insurance costs associated with introducing travis stores into new geographically diverse regions

during fiscal year  comparable store sales increased by  or million  stores in base versus  or million  stores in base during fiscal see risk factors our success will depend on how well we manage our growth 
growth in overall sales volume was also in part the result of additional new travis edition boating packages introduced during fiscal and this included the new addition of the pro line and polar brand boats as well as new boat models introduced by the company s existing boat manufacturers 
these additional new travis edition boat lines have allowed the company to further broaden its boat line up in an effort to continue to address the needs and desires of the recreational boating population 
during fiscal  the company experienced increased parts accessories and service labor sales as an increased percentage of the company s store base was relocated or renovated to superstore standards which provide larger and more accessible areas to merchandise its product selection and conduct repair work on boats 
this resulted in enhanced sales of parts accessories and service labor both in actual dollars and as a percentage of net sales

operating income loss interest expense net income loss the company s business  as well as the sales demand for various types of boats  tends to be highly seasonal 
strong sales typically begin in january with the onset of the public boat and recreation shows  and continue through july 
over the previous three year period  the average annual net sales for the quarterly periods ended march and june represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
with regard to net income  the company historically generates profits in three of its fiscal quarters and experiences operating losses in the quarter ended december due to a broad seasonal slowdown in sales 
during the quarter ended september  inventory typically reaches its lowest levels and accumulated cash reserves reach the highest levels 
during the quarter ended december  the company generally builds inventory levels in preparation for the upcoming selling season which begins with boat and recreation shows occurring during january through march in certain market areas in which the company conducts business 
travis boats operating results would be materially and adversely affected if net sales were to fall significantly below historical levels during the months of january through june 
the company s business is also significantly affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions that are unseasonable or unusual may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels  as well as excessive rain  may affect the company s sale of boating packages and related products and accessories 
see risk factors we depend on strong sales in the first half of the year and our sales depend on good weather 
quarterly results may fluctuate as a result of the expenses associated with new store openings or acquisitions 
the company  prior to fiscal  had attempted to concentrate expansion during the seasonal slowdown generally occurring in the quarter ending december during fiscal  the company modified its acquisition strategy to acquire store locations through out the fiscal year 
this was done to allow the company the opportunity to derive in season sales from the acquisitions as well as to provide a longer period in which to integrate the acquired store s operations 
accordingly  the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of the expected results for any other quarterly period 
liquidity and capital resources the company s short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations  including inventory requirements  off season liquidity and store expansion 
these short term cash needs have historically been financed with cash from operations and borrowings under the company s floor plan and revolving credit lines collectively the credit facilities 
at september   the company had working capital of million  including million in cash  million in accounts receivable primarily contracts in transit from sales and million in inventories  offset by approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million outstanding under floor plan lines of credit  approximately million under revolving lines of credit and million in other current liabilities and short term indebtedness including current maturities of long term debt 
contracts in transit are amounts receivable from a customer or a customer s financial institution related to that customer s purchase of a boat 
as of september   the aggregate maximum borrowing limits under floor plan and revolving lines of credit were approximately million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  operating activities generated cash flows of million due primarily to increased net profits  controlled inventory growth and proceeds received on unearned manufacturer rebate revenues 
management believes that store inventory levels at september  were below standard stocking levels as the company was in the process of contract discussions with its primary outboard motor supplier  outboard marine corporation 
the company was also in discussions with a new alternate outboard motor supplier  mercury marine 
the company could not order outboard motor powered boats until a determination of what type of outboard motor was to be placed on the boat 
the company agreed in principal to agreements with outboard marine corporation and mercury marine in november of and the company has since re stocked its store locations to levels that management believes are historically appropriate 
in fiscal  operating activities utilized cash flows of million due primarily to an increase of million and million in inventories and accounts receivable  respectively 
these amounts were offset partially by net income  before depreciation and amortization  of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of  and an increase in income tax payables of million 
investing activities utilized cash flows of million due primarily to the new store locations  either newly opened or acquired in fiscal  along with the construction of a new facility in gwinnett county  georgia 
in addition  the company purchased real estate in clearwater  florida for the relocation of the st 
petersburg  florida location  key largo  florida and san antonio  texas to take the place of the existing one 
these activities were funded through the mix of the company s revolving line of credit facility  with bank of america formerly nationsbank of texas  na as agent  mortgage debt and internal cash 
financing activities in fiscal provided million of cash flows primarily from the net proceeds of borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the company has a million revolving line of credit agented by bank of america formerly nationsbank of texas  na this line of credit provides for borrowing pursuant to a borrowing formula based upon certain of the company s inventory and accounts receivable 
collateral for this indebtedness consists of a security interest in specific inventories and proceeds thereof  accounts receivable and contracts in transit 
the line has a maturity on january  and pricing is at the company s election of the prime rate minus or on a libor based price structure 
there is a fee on the unused portion assessed quarterly 
a comprehensive loan agreement governs the line of credit 
the agreement contains financial covenants regulating debt service coverages  tangible net worth  operating leverage and restrictions on dividends or distributions 
as of december   million was drawn on the revolving line and the company could borrow an additional million  of which approximately million was immediately available for borrowing based upon the revolving line s borrowing formula 
as the company purchases inventory  the amount purchased increases the borrowing base availability and typically the company makes a determination to borrow depending upon anticipated working capital requirements 
the company is presently out of compliance with one of the financial ratios of the current revolving line of credit 
the company  however  is currently in the process of refinancing and increasing this credit facility to provide for borrowings up to million with several financial lenders  including certain lenders that currently provide a portion of the million loan 
this refinancing is expected to occur on or before february  and will not include the ratio that is out of compliance at the present time 
management believes the company to be in compliance with all other terms and conditions of the current loan agreement and all proposed terms and conditions being set forth in the new refinanced line of credit 
the company also maintains floor plan lines of credit with various finance companies totaling approximately million in credit limits  which generally have no stated maturity and utilize subsidies from manufacturers to provide for certain interest free periods each calendar year usually august through at least may 
certain floor plan lines of credit with finance companies are governed by loan agreements containing financial covenants concerning  among others  minimum tangible net worth and leverage ratios 
as of december   approximately million was drawn under the floor plan lines 
management believes the company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of these loan agreements 
merchandise inventories were million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
accounts receivable increased by approximately million to million at the end of fiscal from a year earlier 
the receivables amount represents primarily contracts in transit generated from sales 
costs in excess of net assets acquired increased to by approximately million to million in fiscal due to the acquisitions during fiscal discussed previously in the section overview 
the company had capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal and included the acquisitions of the store locations discussed previously in the section overview  the renovation of several facilities to the company s superstore standards and expenditures related to the roll out of the company s management information systems in certain store locations 
the company also acquired real estate in san antonio  texas  key largo  florida  clearwater  florida and is under the construction of a new superstore located in gwinnett county  georgia relocating the roswell  georgia temporary store location 
the fiscal and capital expenditures were primarily financed under the company s credit facilities  mortgages and internal cash 
the company s proposed refinanced revolving credit facility  which includes enhanced advance rates on new and used boat inventories and certain accounts receivable  existing floorplan lines of credit and internally generated working capital should be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements in the near future

any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations in the company s point of sale  accounting and other financial operations which could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  could result in a temporary inability to process financial transactions  or engage in similar normal business or financial reporting activities 
similarly  material suppliers to the company may be unable to produce or ship product in the ordinary course of their business operations 
based on recent system evaluations  surveys  and on site inventories  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace minimal portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  as part of a previously planned company wide upgrade to its accounting systems initiated in march of  the company has replaced its integrated accounting and point of sale management information system mis 
the new mis system is currently operating in all store locations 
the new mis system was selected in part due to its ability to allow the company increased efficiencies in its efforts to further centralize full financial and accounting operations 
the company has received assurances that new mis system is a yk compliant system 
the company has one other key system that is not part of the integrated package 
the company contracts with automatic data processing adp for payroll processing 
adp has provided the company with separate software  which is used to administer the company wide payroll 
the human resources department of the company has completed installation of a year compliant version that has been provided to the company by adp 
a survey has been performed on all back office software packages 
we have not seen any material date macros or other date related functions that would be materially affected by dates beyond december  significant non technical systems and equipment that may contain microcontrollers that are not yk compliant are being identified and have been addressed if deemed critical 
this includes  but is not limited to  telephone systems  copiers  fax machines and point of sale credit card authorization terminals 
the company has utilized a written questionnaire specifically designed to query significant vendors  including but not limited to  boat suppliers  parts accessory suppliers and wholesalers  and financial institutions 
certain of the companies queried have responded to questionnaires stating that their systems are yk compliant 
the company is monitoring the status of the questionnaire respondents that have indicated that yk compliance was not yet complete  but is anticipated to be complete during calendar year the company has not received any questionnaires from companies that have expressed an inability or business related purpose that would render them unable to reach yk compliance 
to date  the company is not aware of any yk issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that significant vendors will be yk ready 
the inability of vendors to complete their yk resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by significant vendors is not determinable 
while the company believes its efforts will provide reasonable assurance that material disruptions will not occur due to internal failure  the possibility of interruption still exists 
in the ordinary course of business  the company has acquired a significant amount of yk compliant hardware and software 
these purchases were part of specific operational and financial system enhancements with completion dates during late that were planned without specific regard to the yk issue 
these system enhancements resolve many yk problems and have not been delayed as a result of any additional efforts to address the yk issue 
the company expects that minimal costs will be associated with yk issue 
the company does not expect the yk cost of unforeseen hardware or software applications to exceed  management believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the yk issue 
however  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from the yk issues could also result in a materially adverse affect to the company 
the company currently has assigned three management level employees to further identify risks and carry out contingency plans in the event the company  or its vendors  does not complete all phases of the yk program 
new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
because of the company s minimal use of derivative financial instruments  management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effects of adoption must be reported as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
the company expects that the impact of adoption will not be material to its financial position or results of operations 
inflation the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   approximately of the company s notes payable and other short term obligations bear interest at variable rates  generally tied to a reference rate such as the prime rate of interest of certain banks 
during the fiscal year ended september   the average rate of interest of such variable rates was 
increases in the variable interest rates result in increased interest expense and decreased earnings and cashflow 
assuming the same level of borrowings for the year ended september   which averaged approximately  an increase of in the average rate of interest would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  and a decrease in net income and after tax cashflow of approximately  similarly  a decrease in the average rate of interest would result in a decrease in interest expense and an increase in net income and after tax cashflow
