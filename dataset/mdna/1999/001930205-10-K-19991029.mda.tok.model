item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary ari achieved strong growth in revenue during fiscal compared to  driven by organic growth and acquisitions in the equipment industry 
while all expense categories increased from fiscal to  only depreciation and amortization increased at a faster rate than revenue 
all expenses declined as a percentage of revenue except variable cost of sales  which remained constant  and depreciation and amortization expense  which increased by three percentage points 
even so  total operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue 
therefore  the increase in loss can be attributed to an increase in non cash amortization charges resulting primarily from our acquisitions of powercom and ndi 
see operating expenses 
revenues total revenue for the year ended july  increased  or compared to last year 
total year over year quarterly revenue has increased for fourteen consecutive quarters 
management expects the year over year quarterly increases to continue through fiscal see forward looking statements 
ari provides business to business electronic commerce products and services to customers in selected vertical markets within the equipment industry 
each of the targeted vertical markets in the equipment industry has a shared distribution and or service channel  meaning that the manufacturers share common distributors  dealers and or service points 
our strategy is to build sustainable  recurring revenues in the equipment industry by providing business to business e commerce solutions tailored to address the business problems of each of the targeted markets 
we also have a legacy business that provides a variety of electronic commerce services to non equipment industries 
the non equipment industries generate positive cash flows for ari but have not shown significant growth over the past three years and are not expected to do so in the future 
management reviews ari s recurring vs 
non recurring revenue in the aggregate and within the equipment industry and all other industries 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain revenue information derived from ari s financial statements revenue by industry in thousands year ended july percent percent industry change change equipment industry recurring  non recurring    subtotal    other revenues recurring     non recurring    subtotal     total revenue recurring     non recurring     grand total     recurring revenues are derived from catalog subscription fees  software maintenance and support fees  software license renewals  network traffic and support fees and other miscellaneous subscription fees 
recurring revenues increased in fiscal and fiscal  compared to the prior year  primarily due to increases in the customer base in the equipment industry caused in part by the powercom and ndi acquisitions 
recurring revenues  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased from in fiscal and in fiscal to in fiscal due to increases in sales to new customers and longer than expected new customer implementation cycles 
management believes a ratio of approximately two thirds recurring revenues to one third non recurring revenues is desirable in order to establish an appropriate level of base revenue while continuing to add new sales to drive future recurring revenues 
this revenue mix may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year 
non recurring revenues are derived from initial software license fees and professional services fees 
non recurring revenues increased in fiscal and fiscal  compared to the prior year  primarily due to increased new business in the equipment industry offset  in part  by reduced new business in all other industries 
equipment industry the equipment industry comprises several vertical sub markets including outdoor power  recreation vehicles  motorcycles  manufactured housing  farm equipment  marine  construction  power sports  floor maintenance and others 
management s strategy is to expand our electronic parts catalog software and services and dealer communication business with manufacturers and distributors in the existing vertical sub markets and to expand to other similar sub markets in the future 
revenues from all of our acquisitions are included in the equipment industry revenues 
fiscal recurring revenues in the equipment industry increased  compared to  primarily due to the acquisitions of powercom and ndi  both of which had substantial recurring revenue bases  and to increased revenue from subscription fees and maintenance and support fees from our growing base of manufacturers and dealers 
the increase in fiscal recurring revenues in the equipment industry over fiscal was primarily due to increased revenues from subscription fees and maintenance and support fees from an increased base of manufacturers and dealers 
fiscal non recurring revenues in the equipment industry increased over fiscal due to increased software and professional services sold to new and existing manufacturer customers 
fiscal non recurring revenues in the equipment industry increased  compared to fiscal  due to increased sales of software licenses and professional services as a result of ari s entry into the recreation vehicle market 
management expects recurring and non recurring revenues in the equipment industry to increase at a higher rate than total revenues in fiscal  as we continue to focus our attention and resources in this industry 
non equipment industry business ari s business outside of the equipment industry includes sales of database management services to the agricultural inputs and railroad industries  electronic communications services to the agricultural inputs industry  and the on line provision of information for republication to the non daily newspaper publishing industry 
the non equipment industry business is characterized by a stable base of customers with long term relationships with ari 
recurring revenues in this business increased slightly over the prior year in fiscal and fiscal primarily due to price increases and some increased usage of our services by existing customers  while non recurring revenues declined significantly over the prior year in both fiscal and fiscal because of a lack of significant new customers or application development projects 
management believes the decline in non recurring revenues may signal that we are approaching saturation of the available market for the products and services offered by ari in these industries 
management expects revenues in the non equipment industry business will remain relatively flat between fiscal and fiscal these revenues are profitable on the margin and help to fund ari s growth in the equipment industry 
our five year contracts with the association of american railroads and the associated press  on which our business in the railroad and non daily newspaper publishing industries depends  are up for renewal in december we have maintained good relations with the association of american railroads and the associated press  and  based on discussions we have had with these customers  we believe that it is likely that each contract will be renewed 
operating expenses the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating expense information derived from ari s financial statements operating expenses in thousands year ended july percent percent change change variable cost of products and services sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below     network operations   selling  general administrative     network construction and expansion     gross cash expenses     depreciation and amortization     less capitalized portion     net operating expenses     all categories of operating expense declined as a percentage of revenue from fiscal to fiscal except variable cost of sales  which remained constant  and depreciation and amortization expense  which increased by three percentage points 
total operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue 
fiscal operating expenses remained relatively flat  compared to fiscal  due to tight control of cash expenses 
variable cost of products and services sold consists primarily of royalties  telecommunications and data processing fees  customization labor and temporary help fees 
variable cost of products and services sold increased in fiscal and fiscal  compared to the prior year  as a direct result of increased revenues 
variable cost of products and services sold as a percentage of total revenue remained at in fiscal  as it had been in fiscal and fiscal cost of development services sold as a percentage of development revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to cost overruns on several major software customization projects in the equipment industry 
non development cost of sales as a percentage of non development revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal management expects gross margins to remain at approximately the same level in fiscal and to fluctuate slightly from quarter to quarter based on the mix of products and services sold 
network operations costs are derived primarily from data center operations  software maintenance agreements for ari s core network  catalog data maintenance and customer support 
network operations costs increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased staffing in the catalog data maintenance area from the may  acquisition of ndi 
network operations costs decreased significantly in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as we successfully negotiated reduced software maintenance contracts and completed a restructuring in the customer support area  increasing efficiency and reducing costs  while at the same time improving service levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to additional costs absorbed in the powercom and ndi acquisitions 
these expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower rent  payroll expense and management consulting fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  have steadily decreased for each of the past five years 
the costs attributable to ari s technical staff both in house and contracted are allocated between software development projects that are capitalized  customization projects that are included in cost of sales and projects that are part of operating expenses 
during fiscal  our technical resources were focused primarily on customization projects for our customers in the recreation vehicles market that are in the process of implementing our traderoute r dealer communications system and on adjusting our various software products to bring them into year compliance 
during fiscal development resources were focused primarily on the development of traderoute r and plus r 
during fiscal  ari s technical resources were focused on software customization projects in the agribusiness industry 
we expect our technical resources to continue to focus on software customization in fiscal  although the mix may fluctuate quarter to quarter based on customer requirements 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased substantially in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to the amortization of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization also increased from fiscal to fiscal as traderoute r and plus r for windows were released and amortization expense was recognized for the first time 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal capitalized expenses represented of network construction and expansion expense in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capitalized expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal  as a percentage of network construction and expansion expense  due to labor associated with our year compliance program which is expensed as part of operating overhead 
capitalized expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal  as a percentage of network construction and expansion expense  due to the shift of technical staff to capitalized development of traderoute r and plus r for windows 
other items interest expense increased  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as borrowing under our line of credit with witech increased 
interest expense decreased  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the conversion of portions of ari s lines of credit with shareholders into shares of ari s stock 
we expect to incur additional expense for program fees in fiscal under the receivables sale facility ari entered into with rfc capital corporation in september see liquidity and capital resources 
net loss increased  or in fiscal after decreasing  or in fiscal  compared to the prior year 
the increase in net loss is attributable to the increase in ari s non cash depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the two acquisitions completed in fiscal all other categories of expense decreased as a percentage of revenue 
as we intend to continue our acquisition program  it is impossible to predict with certainty when sustainable profits will be achieved 
given the level of non cash expenses  management expects to generate significant positive cash flow well before full profitability is achieved 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain cash flow information derived from ari s financial statements 
cash flow information in thousands year ended july percent percent change change net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in working capital n a  net cash used in investing activities     subtotal     effect of net changes in working capital net cash used in operating and investing     activities net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital increased in fiscal and fiscal  compared to the prior year  due to increased revenues and tight cost controls 
ari achieved positive cash flow from operations before changes in working capital in fiscal and continued this achievement throughout fiscal net cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased costs attributable to the development of a new release of ari s traderoute r software 
the effect of net changes in working capital is dependent on the timing of payroll and other cash disbursements and may vary significantly from year to year 
though management expects that positive cash flow from operations will continue  we expect to continue to incur operating losses in fiscal due to non cash expenses 
we expect to fund research and development costs with excess cash from operations and the witech and rfc facilities described below 
at july   ari had cash of approximately  compared to approximately  at july  ari has a line of credit with witech that has been in place since october  the witech credit facility 
on september   ari and witech restructured the million outstanding under the witech credit facility to provide for i a million revolving line of credit the witech line which expires on december   ii a million term loan the witech term loan payable in equal monthly principal installments over three years  commencing november   and iii a purchase by witech of shares of ari s common stock by conversion of million of the principal amount owed under the witech credit facility to equity at the rate of per share 
the witech line bears interest at prime plus and the witech term loan bears interest at prime plus 
in conjunction with obtaining the witech credit facility  since  ari has issued to witech shares of its non voting cumulative preferred stock and total warrants for the purchase of up to  shares of its common stock  including i warrants for the purchase of  shares at per share and ii warrants for the purchase of  shares of its common stock at per share 
the exercise price under the warrants is reduced if ari issues stock at less than the then current exercise price 
witech also purchased  shares of non voting cumulative preferred stock on july the only financial covenant in the witech credit facility is that ari must maintain a net worth calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of at least million 
ari has been  and is currently  in compliance with the financial covenant in the agreement and currently expects to comply with such covenant or obtain any required waivers or raise additional equity  if necessary 
as part of ari s acquisition of powercom from briggs stratton corporation briggs in september  briggs agreed to provide ari with a working capital line of credit in the amount of  the briggs line 
ari agreed to exhaust all available credit under the witech line before borrowing any amounts under the briggs line 
the briggs line bore interest at prime plus and was secured by a first position lien against all accounts receivable generated from customers of powercom that were assigned to ari as part of the acquisition 
the briggs line was repaid in full and cancelled on october  on september   ari and rfc capital corporation rfc executed a receivables sales agreement the sale agreement establishing a million working capital facility the rfc facility 
the three year sale agreement allows rfc to purchase up to million the purchase commitment of ari s accounts receivable 
the purchase commitment may be increased in increments of million upon mutual agreement and a payment by ari of  for each million increase 
under the sale agreement  rfc will purchase of eligible receivables 
in connection with the sale agreement  ari is required to pay a commitment fee of  on september    on september   and  on september  in addition  ari is obligated to pay a monthly program fee equal to the greater of a  or b the amount of the purchased but uncollected receivables times the prime rate plus 
ari may terminate the sale agreement prior to three years by paying of the purchase commitment during the first year  of the purchase commitment during the second year  and of the purchase commitment during the third year 
management believes that funds generated from operations and the rfc facility will be adequate to fund the company s operations through the remainder of fiscal in the event the company requires additional financing during fiscal in order to meet its requirements for operations and development investments  management believes that sufficient financing will be available from the rfc facility and the witech term loan and witech line and  if necessary  from the sale of additional securities 
on a long term basis  management believes that financing of operations as well as capital expenditures  will come principally from cash generated from operations 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of ari s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
we have developed and are implementing a comprehensive year program to assess ari s software and equipment and to develop and implement plans to remediate any year issues that are uncovered 
this program includes six phases enterprise planning  assessment  inventory  compliance development  post implementation and business continuity planning 
oversight of the program is the responsibility of the vice president of technology operations with progress reported to the other members of ari s executive team 
immediately following our acquisition of empart  powercom and ndi the acquisitions we expanded our year program to include the products of empart the empart products  the products and operations of powercom the powercom products and operations and the products and operations of ndi the ndi products and operations 
powercom had operations in colorado springs  colorado and ndi had operations in williamsburg  virginia  which were assumed by ari as part of the acquisitions 
the same phased plan has been followed for the powercom and ndi products and operations  with independent timelines for each 
for purposes of our year program  the empart products have been treated as part of the powercom products and operations 
none of the acquired companies had an adequate year compliance program at the time of the acquisition 
for ari  excluding the empart products  the powercom products and operations and the ndi products and operations  the enterprise planning phase was completed in may  the assessment phase was completed in august  and the inventory phase was completed in april the compliance development phase is targeted for completion by december  this phase includes remediation of all non compliant components and system testing of all ari supported components 
for the powercom products and operations including the empart products  the enterprise planning phase was completed in february  the assessment phase was completed in march  and the inventory phase is scheduled to be completed by october  the compliance development phase is targeted for completion by december  this phase includes remediation of all non compliant components and system testing of all ari supported components 
for the ndi products and operations  the enterprise planning phase was completed in june  the assessment phase was completed in september  and the inventory phase is scheduled to be completed by october  the compliance development phase is targeted for completion by december  this phase includes remediation of all non compliant components and system testing of all ari supported components 
affected software includes software used by ari for its own internal operations and software that ari has developed for its customers 
affected operating equipment includes ari s computers and other office equipment and infrastructure systems such as hvac  electric supply and telecommunications equipment and services and similar equipment and services of ari s suppliers and customers 
ari s overall year program including the empart products and the powercom and ndi products and operations provides for plans to either sunset or bring into compliance different computing platforms  ari products  and vendor software products 
we currently anticipate that any problems resulting from non compliant products will be addressed through a combination of product modifications as part of planned product enhancements and migration of customers to functionally similar products that are year compliant 
surveys have been sent to all material suppliers 
alternatives will be identified for any products or services that will not be compliant by december  as of the date hereof  we are not aware of any suppliers with year issues that would have a material impact on ari s results of operations or financial condition 
however  ari has no means of ensuring that suppliers actually will be year compliant by january  we are not aware of any customer with year issues that will have a material impact on ari s results of operations or financial condition 
however  ari has no means of ensuring that customers actually will be year compliant by january  there is a risk that customers may become increasingly resource constrained by year issues and will  therefore  have fewer resources available for purchasing our products and services or implementing our products once purchased 
this could have a material adverse effect on ari s sales 
it is also possible that some of our customers will fail to remediate their own internal year issues and that such failure will adversely affect the customer and its ability to use and or pay for our products and services 
ari is using both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
management estimates that the total cost of the year program will be approximately  included in this estimate is approximately  which management has estimated will be added to our year program costs because of the ndi products and operations 
this estimate is based upon a comparison of the systems and software operated and sold by ari compared to the systems operated and sold by ndi 
these costs are being funded with cash from operations and with the witech credit facility and the rfc facility 
as of september   ari has incurred approximately  relating to all phases of the year program 
our plans to complete the year modifications are based on our best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  and other factors 
estimates on the status of completion and the expected completion dates are based on costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this form k are forward looking statements 
several important factors can cause actual results to materially differ from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to the growth rate of ari s selected market segments  the positioning of ari s products in those segments  consequences of year issues  variations in demand for and cost of customer services and technical support  customer adoption of internet enabled windows r applications and their willingness to upgrade from earlier versions of software  ari s ability to release new software applications and upgrades on a timely basis  ari s ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  ari s ability to manage its costs  ari s ability to manage its business in a rapidly changing environment  ari s ability to finance capital investments  and ari s ability to implement its acquisition strategy to increase growth 
projected revenues and  therefore  profitability and cash flows are difficult to estimate because ari s revenues and operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
the primary cause of the variation is attributed to non recurring revenues from software license and customization fees 
license fee revenues are based on contracts signed and product delivered 
non recurring revenues are affected by the time required to close large license fee and development agreements  which cannot be predicted with any certainty due to customer requirements and decision making processes 
recurring revenues are also difficult to estimate 
recurring revenues from maintenance and subscription fees may be estimated based on the number of subscribers to ari s services but will be affected by the renewal ratio  which cannot be determined in advance 
recurring revenues from network traffic fees and transaction fees are difficult to estimate as they are determined by usage 
usage is a function of the number of subscribers and the number of transactions per subscriber 
transactions include product ordering  warranty claim processing  inventory and sales reporting  parts number updates and price updates 
ari cannot materially affect or predict the volume of transactions per customer 
although ari has recently introduced and plans to expand its internet enabled windows portfolio of products  the marketplace is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that a customer will select ari s software and services over that of a competitor 
the environment in which ari competes is characterized by rapid technological changes  dynamic customer demands  and frequent product enhancements and product introductions 
some of ari s current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and advertising resources than ari 
the widespread acceptance of the internet may increase the usage of ari s product applications and may change the manner in which ari charges for its services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ari is subject to market risks pertaining to interest rate movements and collectibility of accounts receivable 
ari s only expenses subject to interest rate risk are i interest expense on the witech line and the witech term loan and ii monthly program fees owed with respect to the rfc facility 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the witech line and term loan bear interest tied to prevailing market rates 
the monthly program fees under the rfc facility are also tied to prevailing market interest rates 
an increase or decrease of one percent in the prime interest rate would affect ari s net loss by approximately plus or minus  annualized  based on the outstanding balances under the witech and rfc facilities at october  as a result  ari believes that the market risk relating to interest rate movements is minimal
