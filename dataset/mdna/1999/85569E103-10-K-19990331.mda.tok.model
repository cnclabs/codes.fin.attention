overview startec global communications  inc startec or the company is a rapidly growing  facilities based international long distance telecommunications service provider 
the company markets its services to select ethnic residential communities in the united states and europe and to leading international long distance carriers 
the company s annual revenues have increased more than fourteen fold over the last four years from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million  or per diluted common share compared to net income of million  or per diluted common share in the number of the company s residential customers increased from  customers as of december  to  customers as of december  startec was founded in to capitalize on opportunities to provide international long distance services to select ethnic communities in major us metropolitan markets that generate substantial long distance traffic to their countries of origin 
until  the company concentrated its marketing efforts in the new york washington  dc corridor and focused on the delivery of international calling services to india 
at the end of  the company expanded its marketing efforts to include the west coast of the united states  and began targeting other ethnic groups in the united states  such as the middle eastern  filipino and russian communities 
the company once again expanded its marketing efforts geographically at the end of by marketing to ethnic segments in the united kingdom and diversifying its customer base across a broader spectrum of ethnic groups  including the caribbean  latin american and asian communities 
in order to achieve economies of scale in its network operations and balance its residential international traffic  the company  in late  began marketing its excess network capacity to international carriers seeking competitive rates and high quality capacity 
since initiating its international wholesale services  the company has expanded its number of carrier customers to at december  a key component of the company s strategy is to build its own global network  which will allow it to originate  transmit and terminate a substantial portion of its calls utilizing network capacity the company manages 
the facilities currently owned by the company only provide a cost advantage with respect to traffic origination costs 
the company anticipates that this network expansion will allow it to achieve a per minute cost advantage 
as the company transitions from leasing to owning or managing its facilities  the company s management believes economies in the per minute cost of a call will be realized  while fixed costs will increase 
the company realizes a per minute cost savings when it is able to originate calls on net 
for the year ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s residential revenues were originated on net 
as a higher percentage of calls are originated  transmitted and terminated on the company s own facilities  per minute costs are expected to decline  predicated on call traffic volumes 
revenues for telecommunication services are recognized as those services are rendered  net of an allowance for revenue that the company estimates will ultimately not be realized 
revenues for return traffic received according to the terms of the company s operating agreements with foreign ptts  as described below  are recognized as revenue as the return traffic is received and processed 
there can be no assurance that traffic will be returned to the united states or what impact changes in future settlement rates  allocations among carriers or levels of traffic will have on net payments received and revenues recorded by the company 
substantially all of the company s revenues for the past three fiscal years have been derived from calls originated within the united states and terminated outside the united states 
the percentages of net revenues attributable to traffic terminating on a region by region basis are set forth in the table below 
for the year ended december  asia the pacific rim middle east north africa sub saharan africa eastern europe western europe north america other total the company s cost of services consists of origination  transmission and termination expenses 
origination costs include the amounts paid to lecs  and  in areas where the company does not have its own network facilities  to other telecommunication network providers for originating calls ultimately carried to the company s switches 
transmission expenses are fixed month to month payments associated with capacity on domestic and international leased lines  satellites and undersea fiber optic cables 
leasing this capacity subjects the company to price changes that are beyond the company s control and to transmission costs that are higher than transmission costs on the company s own network 
as the company builds its own transmission capacity  the risks associated with price fluctuations and the relative costs of transmission are expected to decrease  however  fixed costs will increase 
when billing disputes between the company and other telecommunication network providers arise  the company accrues the full amount in dispute within cost of services and does not recognize a credit to cost of services until the dispute is resolved 
the company s experience to date has been that the resolution of such disputes occurs primarily in the fourth quarter of each year  and  therefore  the related adjustments to cost of services may have a disproportionate impact on its fourth quarter results of operations 
accordingly  adjustments to the company s cost of services arising from the resolution of billing disputes with other telecommunication network providers may have a positive impact on gross margins in any particular year 
termination expenses consist of variable per minute charges paid to foreign ptts and alternative carriers to terminate the company s international long distance traffic 
among its various foreign termination arrangements  the company has entered into operating agreements with a number of foreign ptts  under which international long distance traffic is both delivered and received 
under these agreements  the foreign carriers are contractually obligated to adhere to the policy of the fcc  whereby traffic from the foreign country to the united states is routed through us based international carriers such as the company in the same proportion as traffic carried into the foreign country from the united states return traffic 
mutually exchanged traffic between the company and foreign carriers is reconciled through a formal settlement arrangement at agreed upon rates 
the company records the amount due to the foreign ptt as an expense in the period the traffic is terminated 
when the company receives return traffic in a future period  the company generally realizes a higher gross margin on the return traffic as compared to the lower gross margin on the outbound traffic 
revenue recognized from return traffic was approximately million  million  and million  or   and of net revenues in    respectively 
there can be no assurance that traffic will be delivered back to the united states or that changes in future settlement rates  allocations among carriers or levels of traffic will not adversely affect net payments received and revenues recorded by the company 
in addition to operating agreements  the company utilizes alternative termination arrangements offered by third party vendors 
the company seeks to maintain vendor diversity for countries where traffic volume is high 
these vendor arrangements provide service on a variable cost basis subject to volume 
these prices are subject to changes  generally upon seven days notice 
as the international telecommunications marketplace has been deregulated  per minute prices have fallen and  as a consequence  related per minute costs for these services have also fallen 
as a result  the company has not been adversely affected by price reductions  although there can be no assurance that this will continue 
the company expects selling  general and administrative costs to increase as it develops its infrastructure to manage higher business volume 
the company expects to incur negative ebitda and significant operating losses and net losses on an annual basis for the next several years as it incurs additional costs associated with the development and expansion of its network  the expansion of its marketing programs  its entry into new markets and the introduction of new telecommunications services  and  in the case of net losses  as a result of the interest expense associated with its financing activities

the company regularly reviews opportunities to further its business strategy through strategic alliances with  investment in  or acquisitions of businesses that it believes are complementary to the company s current and planned operations 
the company s ability to consummate strategic alliances and acquisitions  and to make investments that may be of strategic significance to the company  may require the company to obtain additional debt and or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in arranging such financing on terms it considers acceptable or at all 
although the company intends to implement the capital spending plan described above  it is possible that unanticipated business opportunities may arise which the company s management may conclude are more favorable to the long term prospects of the company than those contemplated by the current capital spending plan 
capital transactions in december  startec entered into a credit facility for up to million with ntfc capital corporation ntfc facility  a financing arm of ge capital 
the line of credit is flexible and may be used to finance switches  associated telecommunications equipment  undersea fiber optic cables  and the expansion of facilities in the company s targeted marketing areas 
each borrowing under the ntfc facility bears interest at a fixed rate equal to the average yield to maturity of the five year treasury note plus the rate adjustment as defined in the agreement 
individual borrowings under the ntfc facility are amortized over months from the date of advance with a final maturity of all outstanding amounts of january as of december   approximately million bearing interest at was outstanding

the senior notes are unsecured and require semi annual interest payments which began november after taking into account the net proceeds to the company from the senior notes and the purchase of the pledged securities together with the company s cash on hand and anticipated cash from operations  the company expects that it will need approximately million of additional financing to complete its capital spending plan through the end of although the company believes that it should be able to obtain this required financing from traditional sources  such as bank lenders  asset based financiers or equipment vendors  there can be no assurance the company will be successful in arranging such financing on terms it considers acceptable or at all 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain additional financing  it will be required to limit or curtail its expansion plans 
the implementation of the company s strategic plan  including the development and expansion of its network facilities  expansion of its marketing programs  and funding of operating losses and working capital needs  will require significant investment 
the company expects that the net proceeds of the senior notes and warrants offering together with cash on hand and cash flow from operations  will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund currently planned capital expenditures and anticipated operating losses through the end of the first quarter there can be no assurance that the company will not need additional financing sooner than currently anticipated 
the need for additional financing depends on a variety of factors  including the rate and extent of the company s expansion and new markets  the cost of an investment in additional switching and transmission facilities and ownership rights in fiber optic cable  the incurrence of costs to support the introduction of additional or enhanced services  and increased sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  the company may need additional financing to fund unanticipated working capital needs or to take advantage of unanticipated business opportunities  including acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances 
the amount of the company s actual future capital requirements also will depend upon many factors that are not within the company s control  including competitive conditions and regulatory or other government actions 
in the event that the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or the company s capital resources prove to be insufficient to fund the company s growth and operations  then some or all of the company s development and expansion plans could be delayed or abandoned  or the company may be required to seek additional financing or to sell assets  to the extent permitted by the terms of the senior notes 
the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock common stock in october initial public offering  the net proceeds of which after underwriting discounts  commissions and other professional fees approximated million 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds to acquire cable facilities and switching  compression and related telecommunications equipment 
proceeds were also used for marketing programs  to pay down debt  for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company may seek to raise such additional capital from public or private equity or debt sources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing or  if obtained  that it will be able to do so on a timely basis or on terms favorable to the company 
if the company is able to raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt  it would likely become subject to additional restrictive financial covenants 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain such additional capital or is unable to obtain such additional capital on acceptable terms  the company may be required to reduce the scope of its expansion  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  its ability to compete and its ability to meet its obligations under the senior notes 
cash flows the company s liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities  purchases of network equipment and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of the senior notes and warrants offering  the company s cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  net cash used by operating activities was approximately million for  and million for the decrease in cash from operations was primarily the result of the net loss and an increase in accounts receivable  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for was primarily related to acquisitions and capital expenditures made in connection with its network expansion 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for primarily resulted from the senior notes and warrants offering 
year compliance many of the world s computer systems including those in non information technology equipment and systems currently record years in a two digit format 
if not addressed  such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions in the us and internationally the yk issue 
a number of the company s technology systems are affected by the yk issue 
to ensure that the company will be yk compliant before the new millenium  the company formed a yk compliance team in the fourth quarter of and allocated corporate resources to determine the extent which the yk issue affected the company and to formulate a yk compliance plan 
since then  the company has been reviewing its embedded technology and infrastructure equipment  as well as non embedded technology equipment to identify those that contain two digit year codes  and is in the process of upgrading its infrastructure and corporate facilities to achieve yk compliance 
in addition  the company is actively working with its suppliers  vendors and customers to assess their compliance and remediation efforts and the company s exposure to yk problems that may be caused by the failure of such suppliers  vendors and customers to become yk compliant in a timely manner 
the company is proceeding on a schedule which it believes will allow it to be yk compliant by the end of the third quarter of the company is focusing on three major areas of concern for the yk issue embedded technology and infrastructure equipment  non embedded technology equipment and third party suppliers compliance 
the yk compliance team created a five stage process for becoming yk compliant 
the five process stages are compiling a complete inventory of all date sensitive technology equipment  prioritizing systems affected based on revenues  strategic issues  and risk exposure  performing modification of affected systems  completing testing of modified systems  and performing implementation of modified systems 
the company has completed the inventory of its date sensitive technology equipment and is in various stages of prioritizing and testing a number of the affected systems 
embedded technology and infrastructure equipment 
the embedded technology and infrastructure equipment area of concern consists primarily of switches  pops  fiber optic cables and various platforms 
much of this equipment is purchased from third party vendors and has been certified by the vendor to be yk compliant 
the certified pieces of equipment  such as many of the switches need only to be individually tested by the vendor and or the company to ensure compliance 
much of the infrastructure equipment contains both embedded and non embedded technology requiring duplicative efforts 
portions of this equipment  such as the magellan platform  have had their non embedded technology certified as compliant while the embedded technology is non compliant 
all embedded technology systems and infrastructure equipment are scheduled to be yk compliant by the end of the third quarter of in addition  in order to protect against the acquisition of additional non compliant products  the company now requires suppliers to warrant that products sold or licensed to the company are yk compliant 
however  there can be no assurance of the accuracy or completeness of any such representations made to the company 
non embedded technology equipment 
non embedded technology systems include predominately applications software and interfacing software 
much of this equipment has previously been upgraded to yk compliance through software upgrades and the purchase of new systems 
specific areas of concern for non embedded technology include the software monitoring and managing the company s call center and customer care database as well as network support 
expenditures regarding non embedded technology are not expected to be material 
nonetheless  the company is in the process of prioritizing those systems that are not yk compliant and upgrading or replacing non compliant systems 
all non embedded technology systems are scheduled to be yk compliant by the end of august newly consummated acquisitions 
the company is rapidly expanding through increased capital expenditures and acquisitions of companies 
upon acquisition  acquired companies become subject to the five step process of becoming yk compliant as discussed above 
time lines for dates of completion of the company s yk compliance process are developed individually for each acquisition 
currently  all companies that have been acquired by the company to date are on schedule to be yk compliant by december  however  there can be no assurance that all acquired companies will be yk compliant by third party suppliers 
the company is currently communicating with its critical suppliers  vendors and customers about their plans and progress in addressing the yk issue 
detailed evaluations of the most critical third parties have been initiated 
the company is also in the process of evaluating and prioritizing the environments in which the company operates 
many of the company s residential and commercial markets include areas of emerging economies where the yk compliance issue does not appear to be a priority 
the company plans to monitor progress made in these areas to mitigate any future exposure however  the company has limited  if any  control over the progress made by these third parties  and therefore  is unable to predict the potential effect on the company s operations if the third parties in these foreign markets fail to address the yk issue 
these evaluations will be followed by the development of contingency plans  commencing in the second quarter of  with completion expected by the end of the third quarter of risk and contingency plan 
there are many risks associated with the yk issue  including the possibility of a failure of the company s routing and compression equipment  computer  and non information technology systems 
such failures could have a material adverse effect upon the company and may cause systems malfunctions  incorrect or incomplete transaction processing  the inability to reconcile accounting books and records  the inability of the company to manage its business as well as potentially losing customers and increasing risk associated with litigation 
in addition  even if the company successfully becomes yk compliant  it can be materially and adversely affected by failures of third parties to become yk compliant 
the failure of third parties with which the company has financial or operational relationships such as lecs  carriers  cable suppliers  billing agents  satellite facilities  equipment suppliers  financial institutions  payroll contractors  regulatory agencies and utility companies  to become yk compliant in a timely manner could result in material adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
the company is currently working diligently to become yk compliant by the third quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in taking corrective action in a timely manner 
the company has started to develop contingency plans with regard to its key technology systems  although there can be no assurance that these contingency plans will successfully avoid a service disruption 
the company intends to document yk contingency plans as part of its yk risk mitigation efforts by the end of july costs 
total costs incurred up to december  specifically associated with becoming yk compliant have been less than  the total estimated specific costs of becoming yk compliant is estimated to be less than million 
these costs will be included in the yk compliance costs once the specific yk components can be identified and allocated 
costs associated with the identification and testing of third party compliance will also be included once such costs can be identified 
readers are cautioned that certain of the statements made herein with respect to the yk issue are forward looking statements 
these statements  which include statements concerning the company s expectations about future costs and timely completion of its yk modifications are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that could influence the amount of future costs and the effective timing of remediation efforts include the success of the company in identifying embedded technology and infrastructure equipment as well as non embedded equipment that contain two digit year codes  the nature and amount of programming and testing required to upgrade or replace each of the affected systems and equipment  the nature and amount of testing  verification  the rate and magnitude of related labor costs  and the success of the company s suppliers  in addressing the yk issue 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
requires the reporting of comprehensive income loss in addition to net income loss from operations 
comprehensive income is a more inclusive reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net loss 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company net loss  as reported  and comprehensive loss 
in june  sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  was issued which redefines how operating segments are determined and requires disclosures of certain financial descriptive information about a company s operating segments 
the january  adoption of sfas no 
currently has had minimal impact on the required disclosures and descriptive information about the company s operations 
the company operates in a single business segment managed on a regional basis 
currently  operating segments outside the north american region are immaterial 
in march  statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop  was issued which provides guidance on addressing whether and under what conditions the costs of internal use software should be capitalized 
sop is effective for all transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december   however  earlier adoption is encouraged 
the company adopted the guidelines of sop on january   pursuant to which the company capitalized approximately  for in april  statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop  was issued which requires that entities expense costs of start up activities as incurred 
the company adopted sop on january  and expensed approximately  of start up costs incurred for organizational activities associated with the company s facilities in the united kingdom in effects of inflation inflation is not a material factor affecting the company s business and has not had a significant effect on the company s operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  and to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company does not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company believes that its primary market risk exposure relate the effects that changes in interest rates have on its investments and those portions of its outstanding indebtedness that do not have fixed rates of interest 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s investments in cash equivalents  which consist primarily of demand deposits and money market accounts  and us government obligations which have been purchased by the company and pledged to make certain interest payments on the senior notes 
in addition  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of the company s long term debt obligations including the senior notes 
as of december   the fair value of the senior notes was approximately million and the fair value of the securities pledged to make certain interest payments on the senior notes was approximately million 
changes in interest rates also affect the company s borrowings under its vendor financing facility with ntfc  which provides that each borrowing under the facility bears interest at a fixed rate equal to the average yield to maturity of the five year treasury note plus an agreed upon rate adjustment 
the company s foreign operations to date have not been material  and  therefore any foreign exchange rate fluctuations relating to the company s results of foreign operations have also not been material 
the company has not entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts or other derivative arrangements to manage risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations exposure may increase in the future as the size and scope of the company s foreign operations increases 
additional information relating to the fair value of certain of the company s financial assets and liabilities is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements
