item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview consumer portfolio services  inc the company and its subsidiaries primarily engage in the business of purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts contracts originated by automobile dealers dealers located throughout the unites states 
through its purchase of contracts  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems  who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers captive finance companies 
the company generates revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  and interest earned on residuals as defined below and on contracts held for sale 
revenues from gains on sale  interest and servicing fees for the year ended december   were million  million  and million  respectively 
such revenues for the year ended december   were million  million  and million  respectively  and for the year ended december   such revenues were million  million and million  respectively 
the company s income is affected by losses incurred on contracts  whether such contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations 
the company s cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company purchases contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset backed securities 
the securitizations are generally structured as follows first  the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust the trust 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing asset backed securities the certificates  generally in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the certificates issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior certificates  from an insurance company the certificate insurer 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the certificate insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread account held by the trust 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the servicing agreements require that the initial deposits to the spread accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the spread accounts reach specified levels  and then maintained at those levels 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related certificates 
the specified levels at which the spread accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the certificate insurer and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios  and have also been varied by agreement 
the specified levels applicable to the company s sold pools increased materially in  and have recently been decreased  as is discussed under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in the contracts sold in the securitization 
that retained interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account and b the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received by the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the certificates  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the certificates and the residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as held for trading securities 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  and accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the spread account the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
for that valuation  the company has used an effective discount rate of approximately per annum 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the residuals that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the certificates  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
at the end of each collection period  the aggregate cash collections from the contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period  then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the servicing agreements 
if the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts that may be below their required levels 
pursuant to certain servicing agreements  excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain certificates to create excess collateral over collateralization or oc account 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the servicing agreements 
spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company as the owner of the residuals 
such balances are generally defined as percentages of the principal amount remaining unpaid on the balance 
the annual percentage rate apr payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate payable on the certificates 
accordingly  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals described above  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts and the effect of trends in the industry 
the company has used a constant prepayment estimate of approximately per annum 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
in valuing the residuals  the company estimates that losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will total approximately cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
in future periods  the company would recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts were to be better than the original estimate  or the company would increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts were to be worse than the original estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals would be required 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the future performance of the underlying contracts  the company during established a provision for future losses on the residuals

the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash from operating activities are amounts borrowed under its various warehouse lines  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold  proceeds from the sales of contracts  customer payments on contracts held for sale  interest earned on contracts held for sale  and releases of cash from spread accounts 
the company s primary uses of cash are the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under its various warehouse lines  operating expenses such as employee  interest  and occupancy expenses  the establishment of and further contributions to spread accounts and income taxes 
as a result  the company is dependent on its warehouse lines of credit and its residual financing facility in order to finance its continued operations 
if the company s principal lenders decided to terminate or not to renew any of these credit facilities with the company  the loss of borrowing capacity would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations unless the company found a suitable alternative source 
net cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   compared to net cash used of million during the year ended december  cash used for purchasing contracts was  million  an increase of million  or  over cash used for purchasing contracts in the year ended december  cash provided from the liquidation of contracts was million  an increase of million  or  over cash provided from liquidation of contracts in the year ended december  on a day to day basis  the company funds its purchases of contracts from dealers by drawing on either of two warehouse lines of credit collectively referred to as the warehouse lines  and pledges the purchased contracts to one or the other warehouse lender 
the amount borrowed under the warehouse lines increases until the company sells the pledged contracts in a securitization transaction  at which time the majority of the proceeds of the sale are used to pay down the related balance of the warehouse lines 
securitization transactions are typically completed on a quarterly basis 
the amount of contracts that the company can hold for sale prior to a securitization is limited by its available cash and the warehouse lines  which permit borrowings of up to a maximum total of million 
the company s cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
the company may borrow under the warehouse lines no more than an amount generally defined as a percentage advance rate of the principal amount of the contracts pledged to the respective warehouse lenders 
the difference between what the company may borrow and what it pays dealers for contracts must come from the company s working capital 
under one of the company s two warehouse lines  an affiliate of first union national bank lends to the company  with the loans funded by commercial paper issued by that affiliate  and secured by contracts pledged periodically by the company 
the first union line has a maximum lending amount of million 
under the company s second warehouse line of credit  the company borrows from general electric capital corporation gecc 
the gecc line was entered into in november  and replaced a prior line of credit arrangement under which an affiliate of gecc lent money to the company in a structure similar to that of the first union line 
the gecc line has an aggregate maximum lending amount of million 
the maximum amount outstanding under the gecc line or its predecessor line in was million and the average was million 
interest under the first union line is at a variable rate  indexed to prevailing rates for commercial paper 
interest under the gecc line is payable at a rate of per annum over libor 
the two lines together had an outstanding balance of million at december   as compared to million at december  the company uses the two warehouse lines in tandem  pledging specific contracts to each lender alternatively 
the amount of cash that the company needs for daily operations is most heavily dependent on i its level of contract purchases  and ii the amount that the company may borrow under its warehouse lines  secured by the contracts purchased 
over the three year period through  the company s annual contract purchases increased from million in to  million in from january through november  the company was able to borrow  under the predecessor to the gecc line  of the principal amount of the contracts purchased 
the first union line allows the company to borrow a varying percentage not in excess of of contract balances  depending on the performance of contracts pledged to that lender 
the advance rate under the first union line decreased during to an average of approximately in the fourth quarter  and the company has no expectation that it will be able to borrow a higher percentage with respect to contracts pledged to the first union line in the immediate future 
the gecc line entered into in november allows the company to borrow no more than of the principal amount of the pledged contracts 
the reduction in the relative advance rates under the warehouse lines  combined with the company s increased contract purchase activity in as compared with previous years  has materially increased the company s working capital requirements 
when the company subsequently sells the warehoused contracts in securitization transactions  the servicing agreements require the company to make a significant initial cash deposit  for purposes of credit enhancement  to the spread accounts 
excess cash flows from the securitized contracts are also deposited into the spread accounts until such time as the spread account balance reaches its requisite level  which is computed as a specified percent of the outstanding balance of the related asset backed securities or collateral 
during the year ended december   cash used for initial deposits to spread accounts was million  an increase of million  or  from the amount of cash used for initial deposits to spread accounts in the year ended december  the cash used increased because i the company sold more contracts in than in  and ii in order to achieve the desired ratings for the certificates  the required percentage initial deposit was raised from in the prior year s transactions to in the transaction completed in the third quarter  with an additional credit enhancement of over collateralization 
the company subsequently reached an agreement  discussed below  that allowed a reduced initial cash deposit of in the company s fourth quarter securitization transaction 
cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  over cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts in the year ended december  such subsequent deposits into spread accounts in include million of cash used to pay down certain senior series of certificates to create excess collateral in an over collateralization account 
cash released from spread accounts for the year ended december   was million  an increase of  or  over cash released from spread accounts in the year ended december  changes in deposits to and releases from spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of sold contracts that make up the company s servicing portfolio 
during  of the trusts incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original contract balance in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective servicing agreements 
accordingly  pursuant to the servicing agreements  the specified credit enhancement levels were increased 
as a result of this and certain cross collateralization arrangements  excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the company were retained in the spread accounts to bring the balance of those spread accounts up to a higher level 
in addition to requiring higher spread account levels  the servicing agreements provide the certificate insurer with certain other rights and remedies which have been waived on a monthly basis by the certificate insurer 
approximately million of cash flows were delayed and retained in the spread accounts as of december  the higher requisite spread account levels ranged from to of the related outstanding balance of the securitized pools 
in april  the company entered into an amendment with the certificate insurer of the company s asset backed securities to cap the amount of cash retained in the spread accounts at of the outstanding securities balance for of the company s securitized pools 
the agreement is subject to certain performance measures that may result in an increase in the maximum level to of the outstanding principal balance of the securities 
the effectiveness of the amendment is contingent upon approval by holders of certain subordinated interests in several of the trusts 
as of march   the aggregate spread account balance of the related securitized pools was of the outstanding principal balance of the securities 
the servicing agreements call for the requisite levels of the various spread accounts to increase if the related receivables experience delinquencies  repossessions or net losses in excess of certain predetermined levels 
during the company s history  the predetermined levels have frequently been reached or exceeded  causing the requisite levels of certain spread accounts to be raised 
during  the requisite levels of the spread accounts were raised to the extent that the company did not receive any releases of cash from the spread accounts subsequent to june the requisite levels of the spread accounts may be returned to the original lower levels if the delinquency  repossession and net loss performance of the related receivables is reduced below the pre determined levels 
in addition  on two occasions  the parties to the pertinent agreements have made modifications that effectively raised the permissible delinquency  repossession and net loss levels  thus resulting in spread accounts reverting to their original requisite levels 
as of december   the spread accounts for of the company s securitized pools had greater cash balances than original requisite levels would require due to delinquency  repossession or net loss performance of of the securitized pools 
such spread account balances therefore included approximately million more than would have been required at the original requisite levels 
funding such increased balances has materially increased the company s capital requirements 
the company did not sell any contracts in the first quarter of  and is currently evaluating alternative structures for selling its contracts during the second quarter of due to the absence of any gain on sale in the first quarter  the company expects to report a loss for such quarter 
alternatives being considered by the company include various securitization structures  unsecuritized sale of contracts  or perhaps  some combination of those structures for future contract sales 
the company expects that if an unsecuritized sale of contracts is completed on a servicing released basis  a loss on sale of such contracts would be incurred  which may result in the company s reporting a loss for the second quarter 
the company has entered into a letter of intent regarding a proposed sale in the second quarter of up to million of contracts on an unsecuritized basis  servicing released 
such a sale would be at a price in excess of the blended warehouse line advance rates applicable to the contracts to be sold  but slightly less than the company s cost basis in such contracts 
accordingly  such a transaction as to which there can be no assurance would result in the company s i recording a loss on such sale  and ii receiving net cash 
recording such a loss may result in the company reporting a loss for the second quarter 
cash received in such a transaction would be applied to meet in part the company s liquidity and capital requirements identified herein 
if the company were to incur a loss for the second quarter of it would be in default under its agreements regarding the residual line 
unless waived by the lender  the default could result in acceleration of the indebtedness under the residual line and a cross default on the warehouse lines 
the lender would receive any releases from spread accounts to retire outstanding principal and interest 
the company believes that the lender would waive such a default 
in the event the lender does not waive the default  the company believes that cash flows from operations would be sufficient to fund its obligations as they become due and payable 
there can be no assurance  however  that the lender would waive the default or that other cash flows would be sufficient to fund the company s operations 
the company is also exploring additional financing possibilities  focusing on issuance of additional secured debt 
although such explorations have involved discussions with  and expressions of interest from  various investment banks  there can be no assurance that any such transactions will take place 
capital resources the company funds the increase in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions  as discussed above  and funds its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and or equity 
during the year ended december   the company completed four securitization transactions  borrowed million under a new revolving line of credit  issued million of subordinated debt  sold common stock to an affiliated party for million  and received million in loans from affiliated parties 
the interest rate payable on the senior certificates issued in the company s securitization transactions ranged from  as compared with payable on the similar securities issued in the reduction in the rates payable is primarily due to reductions in rates payable on us treasuries of similar maturity

see business purchase and sale of contracts securitization and sale of contracts to institutional investors 
commencing with the securitization completed on june   asset backed securities with aaa aaa or p a ratings have been sold through public offerings pursuant to registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
these trusts are structured as owner trusts rather than as grantor trusts 
commencing with the securitization completed on july   the company began using a structure that included a guaranteed money market tranche of asset backed securities  rated p a 
in april  the company established a million residual line with state street bank and trust company  prudential insurance and an affiliate of prudential 
borrowings under the residual line bear interest at libor  and are secured by all of the company s assets  including its residual interest in securitizations 
the residual line is a revolving facility for one year  after which it converts into a loan with a maximum term of four years  due and payable earlier if and to the extent that the company has available cash  as defined in the residual line 
due to the company s continuing purchases of contracts and the need to fund spread accounts when those contracts are sold in securitization transactions  the company has a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases  the required level of initial spread account deposits  and the extent to which the spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
as noted above  the absence of any releases of cash from spread accounts since june  together with the reduction in advance rates available to the company under its warehouse lines  has materially increased the company s capital requirements 
to reduce its capital requirements and to meet those requirements  the company has begun to implement a three part plan the plan includes i issuance of debt and equity securities  ii agreements with the certificate insurer to reduce the level of initial spread account deposits  and to reduce the maximum levels of the spread accounts  and iii a reduction in the rate of contract purchases 
as the first step in the plan  the company in november issued million of subordinated promissory notes due november   to an affiliate of levine leichtman capital partners  inc llcp  and received the proceeds net of fees and expenses of approximately million 
the company also issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share  exercisable through november  the debt bears interest at per annum  and may not be prepaid without penalty prior to november  simultaneously with the consummation of that transaction  certain affiliates of the company  who had lent the company an aggregate of million on a short term basis in august and september  agreed to subordinate their indebtedness to the indebtedness in favor of llcp  to extend the maturity of their debt until june  and to reduce their interest rate from to 
such affiliates received in return the option to convert such debt into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at the rate of per share through maturity at june  the effective cost of this new capital is affected by the valuation of the warrant and the conversion option  but in all events represents a material increase in the cost of capital resources as compared with the company s previous issuances of senior or subordinated debt  which are reviewed below 
additional capital will be required and the company is exploring its alternatives to raise such capital of approximately million  which could include sale of debt or equity instruments 
any debt issued may involve some equity participation 
the sale of any equity or convertible debt could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
the terms of any such additional issuance have not been determined as of the date of this report  and there can be no assurance that any such transaction will occur 
also in november  as the second step in its plan  the company reached an agreement with the certificate insurer regarding initial cash deposits 
in this agreement  the certificate insurer has committed to insure asset backed securities issued by the trusts with respect to at least million of contracts  while requiring an initial cash deposit of of principal 
the commitment is subject to underwriting criteria and market conditions 
of the million committed  million was used in the company s december securitization transaction 
the company expects to use the balance of that commitment in its next securitization transaction 
the company s agreement with the certificate insurer also required that the company issue to the certificate insurer or its designee warrants to purchase common stock at per share  exercisable through the fifth anniversary of the warrant s issuance 
such warrants are exercisable with respect to  of the company s common shares  subject to standard anti dilution adjustments 
in april  the company entered into an amendment with the certificate insurer to reduce and limit the maximum levels for the spread accounts of certain pools to of the outstanding principal balance of the securities 
the agreement is subject to certain performance measures that may result in an increase in the maximum level to of the outstanding principal balance of the securities 
the effectiveness of the amendment is contingent upon approval of certain subordinated certificateholders 
as the third part of its plan  the company reduced its planned level of contract purchases initially to not more than million per quarter beginning in november in the first quarter of  the company purchased million of contracts 
since such time  the company has further reduced contract purchases and expects to purchase less than million for the second quarter of such reductions in contract purchases will reduce materially the company s capital requirements 
over the three year period ended december   the company has increased its capitalization by issuing million of senior debt  an aggregate of million of subordinated debt which is convertible into  or was issued with warrants to purchase  common stock  million of related party debt million of which is partially convertible and million which is entirely convertible and million of capital stock 
the following review of the terms of such issuances shows that the cost of such capital increased materially in in april the company issued  in a public offering  million of subordinated partially convertible notes due  which bear an interest rate of per annum 
these notes are convertible as to of their principal amount into common stock of cps at per share 
in june the company issued to a related party million of partially convertible notes due these notes are convertible as to of their principal amount into common stock of cps at per share 
in april  the company borrowed million as a senior secured loan  which may commence amortization in april this loan bears interest at a rate equal to of per annum over libor at december  cps borrowed million from related parties in august and september  the terms of which were renegotiated in november  in connection with the issuance of million of subordinated notes to llcp  now restructured as described below 
a related party also purchased million of company common stock in july  at per share 
the cost of capital has increased further in to meet a portion of its capital requirements  the company on april   issued million in subordinated notes to llcp the new llcp notes 
the notes bear interest at per annum and include warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
as part of the agreement to issue the new llcp notes  the company was required to restructure the terms of the subordinated promissory notes discussed above 
such restructuring included an increase in the interest rate from to  a reduction in the number of warrants issued to purchase the company s common stock from  to  a waiver by llcp of certain defaults under the notes sold to llcp in november  and a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants from per share to per share 
among the agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the new llcp notes are agreements by stanwich financial services corp 
sfsc  an affiliate of the chairman of the company s board of directors  to purchase an additional million of notes  and of the company to sell such notes 
the terms of such notes are to be not less favorable to the company then i those that would be available in a transaction with a non affiliate  and ii those applicable to the new llcp notes 
sale of such notes would likely therefore involve some degree of equity participation  which could be dilutive to other holders of the company s common stock 
sfsc s commitment in turn has been collateralized by certain assets pledged by the chairman of the company s board of directors and the president of the company 
additionally  the new llcp notes have been personally guaranteed by the chairman of the company s board of directors and the president of the company

year overview 
the year issue is predicated on the concept that some database files may contain date fields that will not support century functions and that some programs may not support century functions even if the date fields are present 
with the change of millennium  the inability to properly process century functions may create halts or sort calculation errors within programs that use century information in calculation and functions 
the company predominantly uses accounting and installment loan application processing software against defined relational database files 
most financial software has long ago been forced to deal with a four byte date field due to long term maturity dates  bond yield calculations and mortgage amortization schedules 
the company has been cognizant of year considerations since late  when contracts with maturity dates in the year were first purchased 
plan 
the company s plan to assess the year issue consists of a three phase process 
the first phase of the process  which has been completed  consisted of assessing all user programs of the company s mainframe computer 
those user programs that were not compliant were either corrected or the necessary software patches have been identified and ordered 
there were no critical user programs identified that could not be modified to be compliant 
in addition  the company s mainframe computer s operating system was also tested and was deemed to be compliant as well 
the second phase of the company s testing will consist of testing all personal computers for compliance 
the company has engaged an outside specialist to facilitate testing and administering corrective procedures where needed 
the company estimates that phase two will be completed by june  the third and final stage of testing consists of identifying key vendors of the company s operations and requesting that those vendors complete a year compliance questionnaire 
any vendors found to be non compliant will be continuously monitored for progress towards compliance 
the company estimates this phase of testing will also be completed by june  costs 
as the majority of the testing was performed internally by the company s information systems department  the company estimates the costs to complete all phases of testing  including any necessary modifications  to be insignificant to the results of operations 
at this time  the risks associated with the company s year issues  both internally and as related to third party business partners and suppliers are not completely known 
through the company s plan of analysis and identification  it expects to identify substantially all of its year related risks 
although the risks have not been completely identified  the company believes that the most realistic worst case scenario would be that the company would suffer from full or intermittent power outages at some or all of its locations 
depending upon the locations affected and estimated duration  this would entail recovery of the main application systems at other locations and or move to manual processes 
manual processes have been developed as part of the overall contingency plan 
in relation to this  system data dumps are scheduled to take place prior to the millennium date change to ensure access to all company mission critical data should any system not be accessible for any reason 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s funding strategy is largely dependent upon issuing interest bearing asset backed securities and incurring debt 
therefore  upward fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact the company s profitability  while downward fluctuations may improve the company s profitability 
the company uses several strategies to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations  including offering only fixed rate contracts to obligors  regular sales of auto contracts to the trusts  and pre funding securitizations  whereby the amount of asset backed securities issued in a securitization exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the loans it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding
