as is generally the case in the recreational vehicle industry  various factors can influence sales 
these factors include increases in interest rates  competition  restrictions on the availability of financing for the purchase of recreational vehicles as well as significant increases in the cost of gasoline 
the company s business is also seasonal in that the majority of sales occur in the second and third quarter 
prior to  the company operated two manufacturing divisions  lancaster  california and elkhart  indiana 
during  the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan of restructuring whereby the company implemented a plan to cease production operations at its elkhart  indiana manufacturing plant and potentially sell all or part of the real estate the facility occupied 
this decision was based upon the company s evaluation of costs and the product quality of the recreational vehicles being produced in elkhart 
concurrent with this decision  the company completed an expansion of its lancaster facility to accommodate the expected rise in production 
the company operated the service center in elkhart  indiana during but in january sub contracted its service and warranty in the eastern half of the united states 
the company has decided to sell the indiana facility 
two key transactions adversely impacted the company s results of operations during in addition to the aforementioned restructuring charge for the production closure of the elkhart facility  the company reached a settlement of an existing class action lawsuit against the company 
pursuant to the settlement  the company was required to pay  plus issue coupons to all members of the class for a discount of on future repairs or  towards the purchase of a new rexhall vehicle 
the company reported the impact from these transactions as charges in the accompanying statement of operations aggregating  for the restructuring and  for the lawsuit settlement during result of operations comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december net revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the number of units shipped in increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
this increase in units shipped was lower than the overall increase in sales as a result of a change in the sale mix 
double slide units introduced in the fourth quarter of increased to of sales in conversely fewer lower margin single slide and non slide units were sold in the average net selling price increased approximately during the period 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for  an increase of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the increase in gross profit is due to increased operating efficiencies and improved quality at the california plant primarily serving our major market in the western united states and higher margins associated with the increased sales of units equipped with higher priced options 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for  a decrease of 
million or 
the decrease in sg a is due principally to decreases in warranty expense as compared to the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sale from in to in results from the increased sales level and efficiencies gained by operating one plant at the corporate headquarters 
the company s effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared with for basic and diluted net income per share was and respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to basic and diluted net loss per share of 
sales and  respectively  in exclusive of the impacts of the restructuring and legal settlement non recurring items during and  net loss would have been million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for basic and diluted loss per share excluding the impact of the aforementioned non recurring items during and would have been for the year ended december  as compared to and respectively  for the increase in basic and diluted net income per share was due to increased sales margins and decreased sg a costs such as warranty 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december net revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in net revenues is principally due to reduced production and sales from its elkhart facility 
during  revenues from the elkhart facility were million  compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was offset by increased net revenues at its lancaster facility of million to million in from million in  an increase of 
the number of units shipped in decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was somewhat higher than the overall decrease in sales as a result of the company s effort to expand its offering of optional equipment items and other product improvements 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the decrease in gross profit is due principally to increased chassis costs  production problems encountered in the production of vehicles at the elkhart facility leading to the company s decision to ultimately close production at the facility  and lastly  increased competition in the recreational vehicle industry 
also contributing to the reduction in gross profit was the overall decrease in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the increase of sg a is due principally to an increase in sales incentive payments  legal expenses and warranty expense as compared to the percentage of sg a to revenues was for as compared to for the increase is due  in part  to fixed costs of the elkhart facility being spread over a smaller population of sales during as compared to during  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring of the company s operations 
the restructuring plan provided for changes in operational and production strategies 
in implementing these plans  the company decided to cease manufacturing operations at its elkhart  indiana plant 
the closure of this facility was done in conjunction with the recently completed expansion of its lancaster  california facility to accommodate the anticipated increased production 
the company believes that the national market can be adequately served from the california facility and that any slight increase in freight charges will be more than offset by the reduced manufacturing costs 
as a result of this strategic change  the company wrote down or wrote off entirely certain of its property and equipment and inventories located at the elkhart facility aggregating  in addition  the company recorded additional charges for severance costs and other expected costs associated with the facility closure aggregating  the total charge of  is recorded as a restructuring charge in the accompanying statements of operations 
during  the company reached a tentative settlement  subject to court approval  of its class action lawsuit 
under the settlement agreement  the company will pay  in cash  and issue one coupon per vehicle owned by the members of the class for  towards the purchase of a new rexhall vehicle or towards service  parts and labor 
coupons would be redeemable at the company s two service centers and at three dealerships which are suitably dispersed around the country 
the company has accrued for the estimated costs of the redemption of these coupons and the cash payment  aggregating  and has recorded this as lawsuit settlement in the accompanying statements of operations 
the net loss before income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  as compared with net income before tax of million for  principally due the aforementioned non recurring charges 
without these non recurring charges  loss before taxes would have been million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the decrease in this adjusted difference is due principally to production inefficiencies in the elkhart facility resulting in reduced gross margins  increased legal  warranty and other administrative costs in the elkhart facility  and increased dealer rebates and sales incentive payments 
the company s effective income tax rate was benefit for the year ended december  as compared with for the income tax benefit in results from the anticipated refund of prior year income taxes from the carryback of the taxable net loss 
basic and diluted net loss per share was for the year ended december   as compared to basic and diluted income per share of and  respectively  in exclusive of the impacts of the aforementioned non recurring items  net loss would have been million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million for basic and diluted loss per share excluding the impact of the aforementioned non recurring items would have been for the year ended december  as compared to and respectively  for the decrease in both of these relationships is due principally to production inefficiencies in the elkhart facility resulting in reduced gross margins  increase legal  warranty and other administrative costs in the elkhart facility  and increased dealer rebates and sales incentive payments 
year the year issue is primarily the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
computer programs that are date dependent are found in the software that operate many it systems as well as in the computer based devices which control many types of electronic equipment 
computer programs that are not year compliant will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to a disruption in the operation of the related it systems or electronic equipment 
the company has established and is implementing a program to address the year issue 
the year program included the implementation of previously planned systems as well as specific year programs 
all programs are on track for completion before the year with various applications being upgraded or replaced as needed 
the failure to correct a material year problem may result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business operations or activities 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
additionally  the year program has not deferred any other company projects that will have a material impact on its results of operation  liquidity or financial condition 
it systems the company began undertaking changes to bring non compliant systems and accompanying methodology to year compliant standards 
in furtherance of the year program  the company acquired a new year compliant client server enterprise system and hired a full time is professional to oversee the implementation of the program 
the it systems have been inventoried and the necessary year upgrades  replacements and retrofits identified 
these projects are presently in various stages of analysis  development and implementation 
the year program is currently scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of non it systems non it systems may contain date sensitive embedded technology requiring the year upgrades 
examples of this technology include security equipment such as access and alarm systems  as well as facilities equipment such as heating and air conditioning units 
the company is a product manufacturer  therefore  the embedded chip issue relates to production line components as well as to the equipment used by the company 
production line components and facilities and equipment are being inventoried and assessments are in progress 
the company is also addressing the readiness of its critical suppliers and customers 
the company has inventoried its critical suppliers  and is sending letters to suppliers  and where appropriate  contacting certain suppliers requesting year certification 
the company is also contacting certain key customers where potential year problems may exist 
in certain areas where the company relies on products supplied by manufacturers for the systems provided to its customers  the company is seeking standard year warranties that  to the extent assignable  may be transferred to customers 
costs the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the estimated total cost of the year effort is expected to be under  this estimate does not include the cost of the company s previously planned business critical systems upgrades  which have not been accelerated due to the year problem 
risks and contingency planning the company has identified and assessed the areas that may be at risk related to the year problem 
the failure to correct a material year problem may result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business operations or activities 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of the year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company has initiated contingency planning for possible year issues  including such factors as supply chain and banking operations 
where needed  the company will establish contingency plans based on the company s actual testing experience and assessment of outside risks 
the company anticipates final contingency plans to be in place by june the year program is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that through its year program  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal business operations should be reduced 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year update should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has relied primarily on internally generated funds  trade credit and debt to finance its operations and expansions 
as of december   the company had working capital of  compared to  at december  the  increase in working capital primarily resulted from a  increase in inventories and a  increase in cash  partially offset by a  increase in accounts payable and a  decrease in current deferred tax assets 
the increase in cash and inventory relates to income and increase in back orders at december  as compared with the same period in as of december  the company has a  line of credit with bank of america which can be used for working capital purposes 
under this line of credit   has been set aside as an irrevocable standby letter of credit for the company to meet the requirements for self insurance established by the department of industrial relations which regulates workmen s compensation insurance in california 
since the company purchased workmen s compensation insurance covering their employees at their elkhart plant  a similar letter is not required for this facility 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit agreement 
the line of credit contains various covenants 
the company was in compliance with such covenants as of december  the company has a  line of credit with general motors acceptance corporation  a chassis vendor 
borrowings under the line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus at december  
all borrowings are secured by the company s assets 
the outstanding balances included in accounts payable at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company has a line of credit with another chassis vendor  ford motor credit company fmcc  with a  limit 
borrowings under the line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus at december  
all borrowings are secured by the company s assets 
the outstanding balances included in accounts payable at december  and were  and  respectively 
fmcc has subsequently increased the line of credit to  as of march   in order to accommodate increased production demands 
capital expenditures during were  management anticipates a comparable level of capital expenditures in cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of  from the exercise of employee stock options  offset by repurchases of common stock on the open market of  the company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements through  including payments related to the legal settlement and expansion plans at the california facility  primarily with cash flows from operations  supplemented  if necessary  by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement 
as mentioned previously during  the company restructured its operations and ceased production in its elkhart  indiana facility 
as a result  the company recorded certain charges for write off of certain property and equipment and inventory in the elkhart facility 
the company owns the real estate for the elkhart facility 
as of december  the company has decided to sell the property 
the company has evaluated the recoverability of this real estate and has concluded that the appraised value of the real estate exceeds the related book value and that the cost of the real estate is recoverable 
accordingly  no impairment write down has been recorded as of december  forward looking statements our report contains forward looking statements  usually expressed as our expectations or our intentions 
these are based on assumptions and on facts known to us today  and we do not intend to update statements in this report 
rexhall s business is both seasonal and cyclical  and the timing of the business cycle cannot be predicted 
its business is also subject to increases in materials costs  and pricing and other pressures from substantially larger competitors  labor disruptions  and adverse weather 
the recreational vehicle industry has in the past enjoyed favorable recreational vehicle industry sales when we have low interest rates  low unemployment  and ready availability of motor fuel 
finally  dealer relations for the entire recreational vehicle industry may be changed by dealers joining together in financial or operating arrangements just now being formed  which may be similar to developments in the automotive or manufactured housing industries 
management intends to remain aware of these factors and react to them  but cannot predict their timing or significance
