for the year ended december   the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to a reduction of the valuation allowance which represents a portion of the company s net operating losses which are expected to be utilized 
actual year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december net sales in were million and million on a pro forma basis in us sales decreased million in to million

income from discontinued operations of aerospace for the year ended december  was million representing the results of aerospace through april   the date of sale

management believes the remaining availability of approximately million under the revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the foreseeable future 
year the year issue refers to the fact that many computer systems were originally programmed using two digits rather than four digits to identify the applicable year 
when the year occurs  these systems could interpret the year as rather than unless hardware  system software and applications are corrected to be year compliant  computers and the devices they control could generate miscalculations and create operational problems 
various systems could be affected  ranging from complex information technology it computer systems to non it devices such as an individual machine s programmable logic controller 
to address this issue  the company developed a multi phase plan including the formation of a team consisting of internal resources and third party experts 
the phases of the plan include taking inventory of affected technology and assessing the impact of the year issue on it systems  non it systems such as factory equipment  building systems and other embedded systems and business partner readiness  developing solution plans  modification or replacement  testing and certification  and developing contingency plans 
the evaluation and assessment phases of the components of software and hardware of the company are complete and the company has adopted plans for remediation 
at this time modifications to existing software are essentially complete and testing phases began in october computer hardware and most manufacturing control systems are currently compliant 
the company expects to have critical it systems installed  tested and compliant by mid calendar year the company relies on third party suppliers for many products and services and the company could be adversely impacted if these suppliers  and the company s customers as well  do not make the necessary changes to their own systems and products successfully and in a timely manner 
the company has implemented a plan to communicate with its customers and suppliers on this issue in an effort to minimize any potential year compliance impact 
the company s primary suppliers of licorice root and licorice extract do not rely on computer applications and will therefore be able to supply the company with its licorice requirements after the turn of the century 
in addition  the company plans to have on hand at december   enough licorice root to meet production requirements for the next fifteen to twenty four months  thus mitigating any major disruptions in the ocean freight transportation system 
the company s principal customers are the major us cigarette and chewing tobacco companies 
they are aware of the year problems and have programs in effect to become compliant by the turn of the century  however  it is not possible to guarantee their compliance 
the total cost of the program is estimated to be million of which approximately sixty percent has been incurred 
all of the costs associated with the company s year efforts have been paid from  or are expected to be paid from  cash flow from operations and have been or will be expensed when incurred 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
nevertheless  since it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company would be unable  in its usual fashion  to take customer orders  manufacture and ship products  invoice customers or collect payments 
in addition  failure of critical suppliers and service providers to perform and disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time nor can the company identify specifically the most likely worst case scenario 
the company has contingency plans for some critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing certain inventories and adjusting staffing strategies 
tax matters in connection with the abex merger and the transfer  mcg and the company entered into a tax sharing agreement 
under the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement and with respect to periods ending on or prior to june   mcg will generally be required to pay any tax liabilities of the company  except for foreign income taxes related to aerospace 
at december   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in years through other the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial position to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of indemnitors failing to satisfy their obligations is remote 
for a discussion of certain indemnification obligations to the company  see item business corporate indemnification matters 
foreign exchange most of the company s export sales and purchase of licorice raw materials are made in us dollars 
the company s french subsidiary sells in several european currencies as well as the us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
as of january  the company s french subsidiary converted their financial accounts and record keeping to the euro as required by the european economic community and french government 
inflation prior to  mafco worldwide had historically been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs onto customers through price increases 
since  inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs have not been significant 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on future cost increases to its customers 
recent developments certain claims against the tobacco product manufacturers were tentatively settled during  though certain of the settlements may be subject to legal challenge 
among other things  the settlements require the tobacco product manufacturers to pay a substantial monetary settlement and adhere to certain advertising and marketing restrictions 
as a result of the and other settlements  the cigarette companies have increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup a portion of the cost of the settlements 
at this time  the company is unable to determine how much of these price increases will reduce the cigarette consumption or the effect on the company s financial performance
