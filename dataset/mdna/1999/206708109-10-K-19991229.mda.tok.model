item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of workplace ecommerce software and services that extend automation to employees throughout an enterprise and to partners  suppliers and service providers in the extended enterprise 
our flagship product  concur eworkplace integrates our suite of workplace ecommerce solutions and provides a portal through which employees can access critical business ecommerce information and services 
the concur eworkplace suite is available in three versions licensed  asp and internet outsourced 
our licensed version  which is principally marketed to larger corporations  includes our entire suite of workplace ecommerce solutions  consisting of corporate procurement  human resources self service and travel and entertainment expense management 
our asp version  called concur eworkplace asp  is offered on a subscription pricing basis principally to larger corporations and currently includes travel and entertainment expense management functionality 
our internet outsourced version  called concur eworkplace 
com  is offered on a subscription pricing basis  principally for small and mid size businesses 
this version currently includes travel and entertainment expense management and corporate procurement functionality 
more than companies worldwide  representing over million end users  have licensed our solutions 
we were incorporated in and commenced operations in fiscal  initially developing quickxpense  a retail  shrink wrapped application that automated travel and entertainment expense reporting for individuals 
we first shipped quickxpense in fiscal and sold quickxpense through a combination of retail channels and direct marketing  utilizing a small sales force and no consulting or implementation staff 
in response to inquiries from businesses seeking to automate the entire travel and entertainment expense reporting process  including back office processing and integration to financial systems  we significantly expanded our product development efforts and released concur expense  a client server based enterprise travel and entertainment expense management solution in july in march  we shipped an intranet based version of concur expense 
since its release  the intranet based version has accounted for a majority of concur expense license revenues 
we expect to focus all future product development efforts on the internet based versions of our products 
on june   we acquired software  inc  a privately held software company and the developer of concur procurement 
software was incorporated in may software was selling the initial version of its product through a single sales representative at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of software 
we also converted all of software s outstanding options into options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  paid  to software  and agreed to pay  to certain stockholders of software 
our total purchase price was valued at million  including direct costs of the acquisition 
the total purchase price was determined by our management and board of directors based on an assessment of the value of software and as a result of negotiations with software 
in determining the purchase price  we estimated the fair value of our common stock and our stock options issued in the transaction 
we also entered into employment and bonus agreements with certain officers of software 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of software and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded million for in process technology as an expense during the quarter ended june  in addition  we recorded capitalized technology and other intangible assets of  that are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on june   we acquired seeker software  a privately held software company and developer of concur human resources 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for all outstanding preferred stock  preferred stock warrants  and common stock of seeker software  and we converted all outstanding options to purchase seeker software common stock into options to purchase up to  shares of concur common stock 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of seeker software 
the historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their actual operating cost structures and  as a result  do not necessarily reflect the cost structure of the newly combined entity 
these consolidated financial statements are now considered the historical financial statements of the company 
in january  we introduced concur eworkplace which provides a common user interface to integrate concur expense and concur procurement and provides a portal through which employees can access critical business ecommerce information and services 
concur human resources will be integrated into concur eworkplace in fiscal concur eworkplace improves employee productivity by integrating common features  such as the user interface  applications icons  approval reminders  status updates and passwords 
it enables it personnel to easily administer employee centric applications that are integrated into concur eworkplace  because the data is captured in a central database  eliminating the need to support  maintain and manage multiple servers and software programs 
in october  we introduced concur eworkplace 
com  which provides features and benefits similar to concur eworkplace but is offered as an asp product principally for small and mid size companies  and requires limited it infrastructure and limited it support 
concur eworkplace 
com is currently available with concur expense and concur procurement 
we expect to add concur human resources in fiscal in december  we introduced concur eworkplace asp  which provides features and benefits similar to concur eworkplace  but is offered as an asp product principally to large companies that want a configured solution offered on an outsourced basis with limited it infrastructure and support requirements 
concur eworkplace asp is currently available with concur expense  and we expect to add concur procurement and concur human resources in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
through june  we derived our revenues from licenses of quickxpense and related services 
in july  we released concur expense 
substantially all of our revenues since the fourth quarter of fiscal have been derived from licenses of concur expense and related services  and to a lesser degree  the sale of licenses and services relating to concur human resources 
we expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from our concur expense product line and related services 
our revenues  which consist of software license revenues and service revenues  totaled million  million  and million in the years ended september   and  respectively 
our product pricing is primarily based on the number of users or employees of the customer 
service revenues consist of consulting  customer support and training 
we market our software and services primarily through our direct sales organization in the united states  canada  united kingdom and australia 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were   and million in the years ended september   and  respectively 
historically  as a result of the relatively small amount of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
for fiscal and prior years  we recognized revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software license revenues were recognized when a non cancelable license agreement was signed with a customer  the software was shipped  no significant post delivery vendor obligations remained and collection was deemed probable 
maintenance revenues were recognized ratably over the contract term  typically one year 
revenues for consulting services were recognized as such services were performed 
commencing with fiscal  we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop these standards generally require revenues earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  installation and training  to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor 
evidence of the fair value of each element is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
the revenues allocated to software products  including specified upgrades or enhancements  generally are recognized upon delivery of the products 
the revenues allocated to unspecified upgrades  updates and other post contract customer support generally are recognized ratably over the term of the related maintenance contract 
revenues relating to consulting and training services provided to customers are generally recognized as such services are performed 
if evidence of the fair value for all elements of the arrangement does not exist  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered 
sop has been subject to certain modifications and interpretations since its release in october most recently in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions which has been adopted by us without any significant effect on revenue recognition 
further implementation guidelines relating to sop and related modifications may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices and such changes could affect our future revenues and earnings 
since inception  we have incurred substantial research and development costs and have invested heavily in the expansion of our sales  marketing and professional services organizations to build an infrastructure to support our long term growth strategy 
the number of our full time employees increased from at september   to at september  representing an increase of or 
as a result of investments in our infrastructure  we have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since inception and as of september   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we expand our product development  sales and marketing and professional services staff 
in addition  we plan to expand our customers and suppliers ability to conduct business to business ecommerce transactions over the internet through the use of our concur commerce network 
the concur commerce network will require additional expenditures as we market and continue its development 
accordingly  we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we have recorded aggregate deferred stock compensation of million 
deferred stock compensation is amortized over the life of the options  generally four years 
during and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million and  respectively  of which million and  was a result of the seeker software merger 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
although historically we have experienced significant revenue growth  this trend may not continue 
in addition  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended september  revenues  net licenses services total revenues cost of revenues licenses services total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative merger and acquired in process technology total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other expense  net net loss years ended september   and revenues total revenues were million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to international revenues were   and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenues in  or license revenues 
our license revenues were million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to license revenues represented  and of total revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the increases in revenues were due primarily to the market acceptance of concur expense  and to a lesser degree  concur human resources 
also driving this increase in revenues was an increase in the size and productivity of our sales force  and sales related to referrals attributable to our december strategic marketing alliance agreement with american express 
service revenues 
our service revenues were million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to service revenues represented  and of total revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
these increases reflected increased consulting revenue primarily a result of concur expense  and to a lesser degree  concur human resources license sales in fiscal and  as well as revenues recognized with respect to maintenance agreements entered into in the current and prior periods 
as license sales increase  we expect increases in service revenues based on the resulting implementation efforts from these sales 
the percentage of total revenues represented by service revenues in prior fiscal periods may not be indicative of levels to be expected in future periods as the proportion of our service revenues to total revenues will fluctuate in the future depending in part on our use of third party consulting and implementation service providers as well as market acceptance of our concur eworkplace 
com and concur eworkplace asp solutions 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues 
our cost of license revenues was million   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or  from to the increase from to was primarily a result of the amortization of capitalized technology recorded in connection with our june  acquisition of software  and to a lesser extent reflects increased expenses associated with sub licensing of third party software due to increased sales of concur expense  and the costs of production  manuals and other media associated with licensing our products 
the increase from to was principally a result of increased expenses associated with sub licensing of third party software due to increased sales of concur expense 
cost of license revenues represented   and of license revenues for the years ended september   and respectively 
we expect that the cost of license revenues may fluctuate in the future depending in part on the demand for our current products and our asp solutions 
cost of service revenues 
our cost of service revenues was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or from to these increases were primarily due to increases in professional service personnel to manage and support our growing customer base 
cost of service revenues represented  and of service revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods due to changes in the mix of services provided by us or by our partners 
costs and expenses sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to the increases from to primarily reflect our investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure  including significant personnel related expenses such as salaries  benefits and commissions  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment expenses  and related costs of hiring sales management  sales representatives  sales engineers and marketing personnel 
the increases also reflect increased public relations and trade show expenses  and sales referral fees paid under our agreement with our referral partners  principally american express 
the increase from to also reflects the cost of our ongoing international expansion of our sales organization into the united kingdom  and to a lesser degree  australia 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we believe that a significant increase in our sales and marketing efforts is essential for us to maintain our market position and further increase the acceptance of our products 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future  and sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods 
research and development 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or from to  and million  or from to the increases were primarily related to increased hiring of software engineers  program management and quality assurance personnel and outside contractors to support our expanded product lines and ongoing product development 
research and development costs represented  and of total revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we believe that a significant increase in our research and development investment is essential for us to maintain our market position  to continue to expand our product lines  and to enhance the common technology platform for our suite of products 
in addition  we plan to expand our customers and suppliers ability to conduct business to business ecommerce transactions over the internet through the use of our concur commerce network 
the concur commerce network will require additional expenditures as we market and continue its development 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in product research and development for the foreseeable future  and research and development expenses are likely to increase in future periods 
in the development of our new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant  and all costs related to internal research and development have been expensed as incurred 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or from to and million  or from to these increases were primarily the result of hiring additional general and administrative personnel to support the growth of our business  increased use of outside contractors associated with increased recruiting efforts  higher amortization of deferred stock compensation  and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to our increase in revenues 
general and administrative costs represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of the continued expansion of our administrative staff and expenses associated with being a public company  including public reporting expenses  directors and officers liability insurance and professional services fees 
merger costs and acquired in process technology 
in connection with our merger with seeker software in june  we recorded a charge to operating expenses of approximately million for direct and other merger related costs pertaining to the transaction 
merger costs consisted primarily of financial advisor fees for both companies  attorneys  accountants  financial printing and other related charges 
in connection with the acquisition of software  we recorded a one time charge of million for in process technology as an expense in the quarter ended june interest income and interest expense 
our interest income was million   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of approximately million from to and  from to these increases reflect interest income earned on the higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of proceeds received in december and april from our public offerings 
interest expense was million   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of  from to and  from to these increases were due to additional bank borrowings and higher capital lease obligations in each of the years 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses since inception that have resulted in deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance 
financial condition our total assets were million and million at september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to cash proceeds received from the sales of our common stock in our december initial public offering ipo  and our april follow on offering 
as of september   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million at september   representing an increase of million  or 
during december  we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with our ipo  resulting in proceeds to concur of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in connection with our ipo  we also received proceeds totaling million from the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in april  we completed a follow on offering of our common stock and issued an additional  shares at an offering price of 
the proceeds to concur  net of offering costs  were approximately million 
our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was principally a result of increased license revenues and service revenues associated with sales of concur eworkplace  including sales of concur expense and to a lesser degree  concur human resources 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable was days and days for the quarters ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that dso will fluctuate significantly in future quarters  and may even increase 
deposits and other assets were million and  at september  and  respectively 
deposits and other assets increased primarily due to a prepayment for a sales referral  marketing  and business partnership 
our total current liabilities were million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase consists primarily of an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and accrued commissions 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to expenses incurred but unpaid as of september  relating to our merger with seeker software in june  as well as our increased growth and ongoing business activities 
the growth in accrued commissions at september  was due to our increased sales in the current quarter over the same period in the prior year 
sales in the fourth quarter of were up from the same quarter in liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and to a lesser degree the use of long term debt  notes payable to stockholders  and equipment leases 
prior to our ipo  we had raised approximately million  net of offering costs  from the issuance of preferred stock  and approximately million from the issuance of long term debt and notes payable to stockholders  and had financed equipment purchases totaling approximately million 
in december  we completed our ipo and received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
in connection with the ipo  warrants were exercised to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share  resulting in additional proceeds totaling million 
in april  we completed a follow on offering and received proceeds of approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
also in april  seeker software issued  shares of preferred stock in a private placement offering in exchange for million in cash and the conversion of million in notes payable to stockholders and accrued interest 
our sources of liquidity as of september  consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  all totaling million  and approximately million of available borrowings under a line of credit 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended september   and  respectively  representing increases of million  or from to  and million or from to for such periods  net cash used by operating activities was primarily a result of funding ongoing operations 
our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
property and equipment acquisitions  including those acquired under capital leases  totaled million  million  and million in the years ended september   and  representing increases of million  or from to and million or from to we financed a significant portion of our acquisitions of property and equipment through capital leases  which consist primarily of computer hardware and software for our increasing employee base as well as for our management information systems 
we anticipate that we will experience an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we do not expect to incur significant costs to make our internal information systems year compliant because we believe such information systems are designed to function properly through and beyond the year our financing activities provided million  million and million in the years ended september    and  respectively 
in the year ended september   cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million from our ipo  million from the exercise of warrants as a result of the ipo  and million from our follow on offering 
additionally  we raised million in connection with the offering of seeker software s preferred stock in april we have a line of credit with a bank for million that expires in march the line of credit bears interest at the lending bank s prime rate plus 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable or million and are secured by substantially all of our non leased assets 
as of september   we had not borrowed under the line of credit  however  there was a standby letter of credit outstanding for  approximately million remained available under this line as of september  in september  we entered into a million senior term loan facility with the same bank with which we have the line of credit  pursuant to the terms of a security and loan agreement 
in april  the senior term loan facility was amended to allow for additional borrowings up to a total of million 
the facility  which bears interest at the lending bank s prime rate less  matures on february  payments were interest only through february   at which time we started to pay off the facility in equal monthly principal payments plus interest 
the loan agreement contains certain financial restrictions and covenants  with which we are currently in compliance 
as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement was million 
in july  we entered into a subordinated loan and security agreement with an equipment lessor in the principal amount of million that bears interest at an annual rate of 
in may  this agreement was amended to allow for additional borrowings of million bearing interest at an annual rate of on the first million and on the remaining million  which expired on december  the notes are due in varying monthly installments through april  and contain certain restrictions and covenants  with which we are currently in compliance 
at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated loan agreement was million 
we also have an existing equipment line of credit with a bank  which is no longer available for additional borrowings 
principal payments of approximately  plus interest which accrues at the prime rate plus are due monthly through october at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the equipment line of credit was  in september  we entered into an additional subordinated promissory note agreement with an equipment lessor in the principal amount of million 
the note bears interest at  payments are due in monthly installments of approximately  including interest  and the note matures in november at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated loan agreement was million 
on august   we issued a warrant to trs to purchase shares of our series e preferred stock 
in connection with our ipo in december  this warrant was converted into a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in december  trs exercised a portion of the warrant to purchase  shares at per share 
additionally  under the warrant  trs may acquire  shares at any time on or before october  at a cash purchase price of per share   additional shares at any time on or before january  at a cash purchase price of per share  and  shares at any time on or before january  at a cash purchase price of per share 
trs did not exercise the warrants that expired on october  we currently anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses related to augmenting our sales and marketing operations  increasing research and development and extending our professional service capabilities 
we also anticipate developing new distribution channels  improving our operational and financial systems  entering new markets for our products and services  and possibly acquiring or investing in complementary businesses  products or technologies or investing in joint ventures 
such expenditures will be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  financing under leasing arrangements  or otherwise 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
background of year issues many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty first century dates because such systems were developed using two digits rather than four to represent the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this error could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process translations  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such year requirements 
state of readiness our business depends on the operation of numerous systems that could potentially be affected by year related problems 
those systems include  among others hardware and software systems we use to deliver products and services to customers  including our proprietary software systems as well as software supplied by third parties  communications networks such as the internet and private intranets  internal systems that our customers and suppliers use in the management of their businesses  software products we sell to customers  the hardware and software systems we use internally in the management of our business  and non information technology systems and services  such as power  telephone systems and building systems 
our year compliance task force  composed of high level representatives of the product management  information systems  technical services and legal departments  has worked to ensure the year readiness of our operations  products and relationships 
the phases of our year program include assignment of responsibility for external issues  such as products we developed and licensed to customers  and internal issues  such as systems  facilities  equipment  software  and legal audit  inventory of all aspects of our operations and relationships subject to the year problem  comprehensive analysis  including impact analysis and cost analysis  of our year readiness  as well as business contingency planning  and remediation and subsequent testing 
we have tested our software products and have determined that the currently shipping versions of all our software products are year compliant consistent with the year compliance specifications established by the british standards institute s disc pd some product versions no longer shipping had year issues that have already been resolved with patches or updates provided at no charge to authorized licensees 
some earlier product versions no longer shipping that have year issues will be patched or updated in a timely manner with no charge to authorized licensees 
some remaining older versions not currently shipping may not be supported beyond december  and our customer base has been notified of this fact through our web site and written notices 
we have now completed all four phases of our year compliance program 
we plan to continue to test our current and future products by applying our year compliance criteria through the new year and to take corrective actions  as appropriate 
in addition  certain of our technical support  product development and consulting personnel will be assigned on call duty scheduled for the first few days of january to handle any year problems experienced by our customers in connection with one of our software products 
risks related to year issues our products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving sophisticated third party hardware and software products  which may not themselves  be year compliant 
in addition  in some cases even certain earlier year compliant versions of our software  while compatible with earlier  non year compliant versions of other software products with which concur s software was integrated  are not compatible with certain more recent year compliant versions of such other third party software providers 
while we do not believe we have any obligation under this circumstance because customers using our older versions of our software would have to upgrade in order to be compatible with newer versions of third parties products there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims or complaints by our customers 
we sell our products to companies in a variety of industries  each of which is experiencing different year compliance issues 
customer difficulties with their year issues might require us to devote additional resources to resolve their underlying problems  however  our year compliance efforts cannot assure the success of our customers in dealing with their year issues 
although we have not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date involving our products or services and related to year compliance issues  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future be required to defend our products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  regardless of the merits of such disputes  and any liability for year related damages  including consequential damages  would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we believe that purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers have  and will continue to be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to finalize correction or upgrading of their current software systems for year compliance or defer additional software purchases until after as a result  some customers and potential customers may have more limited budgets available to purchase software products such as those offered by us  and others may choose to refrain from changes in their information technology environment until after to the extent year issues and initiatives cause significant delay in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase our products or services  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we have also reviewed our internal management information and other systems in order to identify any products  services or systems that are not year compliant 
to assist us in this initiative  we retained the services of a year consulting firm which assisted with all four phases of our year program 
to date  we have not encountered any material year problems with our computer systems or any other equipment that might be subject to such problems 
we have received responses to compliance verification requests from substantially all of the material external vendors supplying software and information systems to us to whom we circulated such requests 
the purpose of these requests was to determine the readiness of third parties remediation of their own year issues 
while we do not expect to experience any major year problems as a result of such vendors year compliance status based on the responses received by us  in the event that any such third parties products  services or systems turn out not to meet the year requirements on a timely basis  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we could also experience material adverse effects on our business if we have failed to identify all year dependencies in our systems and in the systems of our suppliers  customers and financial institutions 
therefore  we have established contingency plans for continuing operations in the event such problems arise and for handling year problems that are not detected and corrected prior to their occurrence 
despite our efforts  however  there can be no assurance that the total cost of year compliance  remediation and promulgation of our contingency plans  if necessary  will not be material to our business 
we may find that we did not foresee all significant year problems on a timely basis and such unforeseen problems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our operating results are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our cash equivalents are invested in short term debt instruments while certain portions of our outstanding long term debt bear interest at variable rates 
based on our marketable securities portfolio and interest rates at september   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately million  respectively  in the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio  however  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold
