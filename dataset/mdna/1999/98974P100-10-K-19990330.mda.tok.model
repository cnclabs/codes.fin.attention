non employee stock options granted in proposed director stock option plan in january  certain non employee directors were granted options to purchase  in the aggregate  approximately  shares of the company s common stock  subject to approval of a new directors stock option plan by the company s stockholders

accounting for non employee stock options the financial accounting standards board recently concluded its initial deliberations on several practice issues under apb the proposed effective date of a new financial accounting standard setting forth these conclusions would be its issuance date  which presently is expected to be in september  but would apply to all stock option grants subsequent to december  a consequence of the application of the tentative conclusions would be that outside directors that receive stock options would not be included under the scope of apb because they would no longer be considered employees 
stock option grants to outside directors after december  would  therefore  give rise to compensation expense  determined in accordance with the following paragraph  and recognized over the vesting period for periods subsequent to the effective date of the new accounting standard 
the accounting for equity instruments  such as the stock options discussed in the paragraphs above  issued to non employees for services rendered is governed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation and emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
these pronouncements require the fair value of equity instruments given as consideration for services rendered be recognized as a non cash charge to income over the shorter of the vesting or service period 
the equity instruments must be revalued on each subsequent reporting date until performance is complete with a cumulative catch up adjustment recognized for any changes in their fair value 
as a result  the company s future results of operations could be materially impacted by a change in valuation of the stock options discussed above  or other equity instruments granted in the future to non employees  as a result of future increases or decreases in the price of the company s common stock 
however  the required accounting treatment will have no impact on the company s cash flows or total stockholders equity 
impact of the year the year issue is primarily the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
there are no material year compliance requirements confronting the company since it has no existing operating businesses 
the company s current financial and administrative systems are fully compliant 
accordingly  the company has no ongoing remediation plans with respect to its current systems 
software systems developed for use in connection with the company s new internet related businesses will be designed and tested for year compliance 
the company continues to assess the impact  if any  the year issue will have on its key vendors and development partners before the inception of a relationship 
if the company s assessments of the impact of the year issue prove to be incorrect  the company s new internet related businesses may be materially affected 
new financial accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because the company does not currently use derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on operating results or the financial position of the company

the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following product development and market acceptance 
the company s growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of new products 
successful development of a development stage enterprise  particularly internet related businesses  can be difficult and costly  there are no assurances of ultimate success and a start up enterprise involves risks and uncertainties  including the following 
there are no assurances that the company will be able to successfully and timely develop new products for its targeted businesses  that it will be able to compete effectively against similar or alternative businesses  that it will gain market acceptance  that it will not be made obsolete by further technological development  that it will be able to provide or attract the necessary capital or that it will not encounter other  and even unanticipated  risks 

use of the internet by consumers  while growing  is still at an early stage of development  and market acceptance of the internet as a medium for entertainment  commerce and information is still subject to a high level of uncertainty 

the company may decide to exit the internet transaction payment business at any time 
competition and technological change 
the company will be competing with larger companies that have access to greater capital  research and development  marketing  distribution and other resources than the company 
in addition  the internet market is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid product development and technological change that could render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
intellectual property rights 
the company relies in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
it may be necessary to defend these rights or to defend against claims that the company is infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
lack of standards 
there are currently no generally accepted standards for internet payment systems 
there is no assurance that the internet transaction payment system the company is developing will become a generally accepted standard or that it will be compatible with any standards that become generally accepted 
sales of businesses 
the company disposed of its operating businesses in and in connection with those dispositions  the company agreed to provide customary indemnifications to the purchasers of those businesses for breaches of representations and warranties  covenants and other specified matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it faces material market risk with respect to its cash investments and marketable securities  which totalled  and  at december  and  respectively 
these investments  all of which mature within one year  consist of high grade us corporate debt securities and certificates of deposits  and do not include derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  as such terms are defined by the securities and exchange commission in applicable regulations 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s operating results or cash flows due to the short term  high credit quality nature of the company s investments
