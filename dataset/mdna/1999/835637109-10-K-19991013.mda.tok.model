item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
organic packaged products business 
through its subsidiary  made in nature company  inc minco  the company markets a broad line of packaged organic dried fruits and organic chilled and pasteurized fruit juices and drinks under the made in nature brand 
the products are principally sold through brokers to natural food distributors and supermarkets in the united states and canada 
in addition  minco supplies leading food manufacturers  mostly in japan  with organic fruit juice concentrates 
competition 
in the organic food categories in which minco competes  the competition is relatively small 
in the organic chilled beverage category on a national basis  minco has two major direct competitors 
in the organic dried fruit and vegetable category on a national basis  minco has two major direct competitors 
in the mass market sector  minco has many large competitors  but none of these competitors is currently marketing an organic product 
minco s growth will depend on its ability to continue to expand distribution in conventional supermarkets and in natural food specialty markets 
distribution through both channels presents significant marketing challenges  risks and distribution costs 
there is no assurance that minco can achieve trade or consumer expansion in either channel 
minco s products are generally premium priced and may be sensitive to national and regional economic conditions 
sources of supply 
minco contracts with growers and grower packers for the purchase of its organic raw material 
packaging is done under contract 
minco is a marketing company and has no production facilities 
although organic farming has increased over the last five years  as with all agricultural products  shortages can occur 
a significant shortage of raw materials may have a material adverse effect on minco 
licensing agreements 
made in nature brand fresh produce is sold under a licensing agreement with minco through new world marketing llc 
in  made in nature  inc licensed the use of its brand in japan to takanashi  which intends to market made in nature brand products throughout japan 
organic certification 
the value of the made in nature brand is dependent on the organic certification 
the loss of this certification would have a material adverse effect on minco 
minco is dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality  and possible dietary benefits of its products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity concerning organic products  minco s products or the products of its licensees could have a material adverse effect on minco s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the usda has been developing the rules for the national organic program for eight years  as mandated in the organic food protection act of the proposed rules were released in early and were met with significant opposition 
due to this opposition the usda is re evaluating the proposed rules 
if the usda rules do not provide the restrictions emphasized in the opposition to the initial proposal  the image of organic by the consumer may be impaired and as a result negatively affect minco s sales 
inventories 
minco s inventories of raw materials and finished goods on hand as of june  were  it is anticipated that building the made in nature brand will increase working capital requirements 
minco has had net operating losses since acquisition in june  and there can be no assurance that it can achieve profitable operations in the foreseeable future 
due to the performance of made in nature to date  the company has recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write off the unamortized balance of goodwill 
real estate the company is seeking to lease all available space at its facilities to outside third parties

dried fruit ingredients business 
through drying processes  the moisture in apples is reduced from original levels of to as low as 
in addition  the company purchases other fruits such as apricots  dates  peaches and prunes  which have been partially dried  and further reduces the moisture in these fruits to levels of approximately 
the resultant low moisture products are much lighter in weight and less bulky than their raw  canned or frozen counterparts 
because of their extreme dryness  low moisture fruit products require no refrigeration or other special storage conditions 
other advantages include consistent product quality  economical packaging and convenience in handling and use 
industry and competition 
the low moisture food industry in the united states is comparatively small with only a few processors engaged in the dehydration of fruits to low moisture levels to moisture 
the company has had one major domestic competitor  a few smaller domestic competitors and several foreign competitors in the low moisture and evaporated businesses 
numerous processors compete in the business of producing bulk apple juice and concentrate 
sales and marketing 
the company s sales have been worldwide but principally to manufacturers in the united states and canada 
the company s products are primarily sold through brokers to major food processors  bakeries  food storage and food service operators and to federal and state institutions 
approximately of the company s sales have been generated from annual contracts that are normally written between august and november of each year 
most of these contracts are for one year 
the sales price is normally fixed 
during the fiscal year  the customer will order against these contracts  and the company will invoice the customer based upon the price and other terms and conditions of the contract 
the company has incurred risk under these contracts because the total quantity of raw materials required to fulfill these contracts has normally not been procured at the time the contracts are written 
more than half of the company s raw material requirements historically have not been purchased under contract 
if the price of raw materials increases or decreases  the company has either benefitted from or absorbed these variances from what was budgeted 
the company s raw material costs and the related yield in processing has varied from year to year 
this process has existed for many years  and the company has experience in dealing with this risk 
sources of supply 
in terms of volume  apples have represented the major fruit handled by the company 
the company s production facility was designed to process fresh fruit in addition to partially dehydrated dried fruits or vegetables 
the sources of apple raw material supply have been individual apple growers  apple fresh packing operators and  in emergencies  other dried apple processors 
the majority of the company s raw apple supply has come from california 
in some years  due to crop conditions  the percentage of fruit purchased from out of state sources may increase 
in those years  the company has incurred increased costs due to additional freight 
the company has striven to reflect such cost increases in selling price adjustments  but  when unsuccessful  it has absorbed such costs 
other important fruits  including peaches  apricots and prunes  have been obtained principally from dried fruit packing houses in california 
for other supplies  including cans and packaging materials  the company has drawn from a number of vendors 
seasonal nature of business 
the business of producing evaporated apples  bulk apple juice and concentrate is seasonal  beginning in august and usually ending in march or april 
in fiscal  the company changed its production plan  and as a result production was extended into september 
with the pending closure of the plant every effort was made to convert all inventory items into marketable product 
food storage business 
the company manufactures a broad line of food storage products under the perma pak label 
dried food ingredients are purchased or  in some cases  manufactured by the company and canned utilizing a special process which creates a low oxygen environment  allowing prolonged shelf stability 
perma pak products are sold with a guaranteed life of eight years from the date of manufacture 
sales and marketing 
sales of perma pak products are principally to a master distributor located in the united states  which creates food storage units designed to supply a family s nutritional needs for up to a year 
these units contain both perm pak and other products  and are sold by the master distributor through a multi level marketing system 
current levels of perma pak inventory are high see below  and the company is actively seeking new channels of distribution for its perma pak product lines  including direct to consumer sales over an internet web site 
sources of supply and inventory 
although certain dried fruit products contained in the perma pak line are manufactured by the compan  most supplies are drawn from a number of vendors 
the company expects that adequate supplies will be available 
current inventories include  of raw materials and  of finished goods  a high level relative to current weekly sales 
this high level of inventory resulted from a rapid escalation in sales due to year yk concerns  followed by a sudden and unexpected sales drop in march of as predictions of yk disruptions were tempered 
a charge was taken in the fourth quarter of million to write down the perma pak inventory to net realizable value 
backlog with the sale of the company s apple ingredients product line  comparative backlog information is no longer relevant 
however  the company anticipates that it will liquidate substantially all of the apple ingredients inventory by october  pursuant to the agreement between vacu dry and tree top relating to sale of the apple product lines of business  tree top has agreed to purchase any such inventory remaining unsold as of september   other than distressed inventory  at its agreed purchase price as set forth in the agreement 
tree top may not purchase more than  worth of inventory 
trademarks the company holds the following registered trademarks made in nature  apple munchies  noah s ark  fruit galaxy  perma pak and pantri reserve 
as part of the apple product lines asset sale the company sold the trade name and trademark rights of vacu dry 
the company will seek shareholder approval of a new name and nasdaq ticker symbol at the annual meeting to be held on november  sales of trademarked goods has accounted for the majority of the company s total sales 
made in nature and perma pak are the predominant trademarks of those listed above 
the made in nature brand is important to the company in connection with the sale of its branded organic products 
research and development for information on research and development expenditures  see note to the financial statements for the year ended june  environmental matters the company has complied with all governmental regulations regarding protection of the environment 
no material capital expenditures are anticipated for environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year 
employees the company has normally employed an average of approximately persons 
the company anticipates substantially reducing its workforce following the sale to tree top 
the number of employees needed normally varied throughout each year and increased during periods of high production 
of the employees  approximately are represented by the general truck drivers  warehouseman and helpers union  teamsters local a collective bargaining agreement with those union employees expired june  effects negotiations as required by federal law  were entered into between the union and the company on june  during these negotiations a one year extension to the collective bargaining agreement with no changes was approved by the company and the union 
effects negotiations between the company and the union are continuing as of the end of the fiscal year 
insurance the company maintains product  property  and general liability insurance plus umbrella liability coverage 
the company does not carry any product recall coverage

overview since the company acquired certain of the assets and liabilities of made in nature  inc on june   vacu dry has operated in three business segments industrial dried fruit ingredients  organic packaged foods and real estate 
the company commenced a strategic reorientation upon the announcement of the proposed sale of its apple based industrial ingredients product line in june  in august  the decision was made to sell or discontinue all product lines in the company s industrial dried fruit ingredients business 
as a result of these decisions  the ingredients business is considered a discontinued operation and its operating results  results of cash flows and net assets are reflected outside of the company s continuing operations 
discontinued operations in june  the company announced an agreement  subject to shareholder approval received july  to sell the bulk of its apple based industrial ingredients product line to tree top  inc  of selah  washington 
this product line represented and of the company s sales for the years ended june  and  respectively 
at the same time  the company also decided to close its only apple processing plant in sebastopol  california 
this sale is an important element in vacu dry s strategic plan to increase the return on its investments and thereby to increase shareholder value 
following completion of the sale  the company determined in august  that the remaining product lines in the company s vacuum ingredients segment of its business would be discontinued and held for sale 
these product lines include the company s dried ingredients  perma pak long term food storage  and drink mix businesses 
as a result of these decisions  the company has classified this business segment as a discontinued business 
accordingly  the company has segregated the net assets of the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet at june   the operating results of the discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal and the cash flows from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded after tax earnings from discontinued operations of  the after tax earnings resulted from ingredients business sales of million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase in sales of million was almost entirely in the food storage product line 
after the allocation of selling  general and administrative expenses between continuing and discontinued operations  the ingredients business generated  of operating income in fiscal versus million in fiscal included in cost of sales  however  in fiscal is the write down of food storage inventories by million to reflect estimated net realizable value 
while the company experienced exceptionally strong food storage sales through the third quarter of fiscal  current market demand for food storage products has declined dramatically 
as management stated in the previous form q for the period ended march   the company had experienced a significant decline in food storage sales since the quarter s end 
this resulted in high levels of inventory on hand and created significant uncertainties with respect to future revenues from the food storage line 
the company is actively marketing all of its discontinued product lines and has presented offering information to interested parties 
there can be no assurances that there will be a sale of all or any of the remaining product lines 
the decision to sell the industrial ingredients product lines is an effort by the company to increase shareholder value by exiting businesses with low returns and high capital requirements 
the transactions will provide financial resources to support the company s real estate and other business opportunities 
results of continuing operations the company s continuing lines of business consist of the sales and marketing of organic packaged foods and beverages through the company s subsidiary made in nature company  inc and the leasing and development of the company s real estate 
the company has been focusing on its made in nature operations throughout fiscal and has reduced the selling  general and administrative staff from fourteen at july  to five at june  sales were million for the year ended june   resulting in a gross margin of  of sales 
unlike its discontinued ingredients business  the company does no processing of made in nature products 
the company uses contract packers and outside warehouses for the processing  packaging and distribution of its organic natural food products 
the results of continuing operations for the year ended june  include the accounts of made in nature company  inc for the day period from acquisition june  to year end 
with the closure of its apple processing plant  a significant portion of the company s future revenues will come from the company s second business segment  real estate 
the company intends to develop its real estate largely for industrial rental 
subsequent event on july   the company received the approval of its shareholders to sell certain intangible assets  including customer lists  certain trademarks and a non competition agreement  and some equipment related to its processed apple product lines to tree top  inc in the first quarter of fiscal  the company will record the sale 
the terms of the sale included the payment of million cash to vacu dry upon closing the transaction on july  tree top has also committed to the purchase of related product line inventories up to a maximum million on september  the company anticipates that the after tax gain on the sale will be between and million  although there can be no assurance of this amount 
the amount of the gain will vary depending upon the disposal value of assets not acquired by tree top  the level of severance and relocation costs  wind down costs  transaction costs and identified liabilities 
reference is hereby made to the form k filed july  in addition  as part of the transaction  the company sold the vacu dry trademark 
thus  the company will be seeking shareholder approval prior to december  to change its name 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the current year sales of million are exclusively those of made in nature 
this compares to of made in nature sales in fiscal the prior year s sales were not significant since they represent less than a three week period 
rental revenue 
the company currently leases warehouse space in several buildings and a yard as well as excess space in its production facility 
there are leases with twelve tenants that have varying terms ranging from month to month to eight years with options to extend 
substantially all available space at june  was under lease 
fiscal rental revenues increased or  over fiscal this increase was a result of higher market rental rates  cpi increases and the leasing of some previously vacant space 
cost of goods sold 
the costs are related to the sales of made in nature products 
the company realized gross margins of  or of sales in fiscal versus  or of sales in fiscal however  due to the short period in fiscal  the fiscal years are not comparable 
selling  general administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include direct costs related to continuing operations and all general corporate costs 
only direct selling  general and administrative costs related to the ingredients business were allocated to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses related to continuing operations increased million from the prior year 
this change was principally due to the inclusion of million of additional selling  general and administrative expenses related to made in nature and additional costs incurred of  for the early buy out of an employment agreement 
general corporate expenses of million were  higher than the prior year due to salaries and benefits associated with increased staffing  increased legal and professional fees resulting from the product line sale and temporary help 
write down of goodwill 
due to the continued operating losses of made in nature and uncertain prospects going forward  management evaluated the recoverability of the unamortized goodwill of at june  related to the made in nature company  inc acquisition 
it was determined that the estimated future cash flows were not sufficient to recover the goodwill s carrying value and a write down was required 
interest expense 
interest expense for both fiscal and fiscal relates to continuing operations 
it includes interest on mortgage debt  shareholder loans and the portion of interest expense internally charged to made in nature based on intercompany borrowings 
interest costs of  in fiscal and  in fiscal are included in discontinued operations 
in fiscal interest expense from continuing operations increased  from the prior year 
the company s mortgage debt was not incurred until fiscal and interest expense charged to made in nature represented only nineteen days in fiscal income taxes 
the fiscal effective tax rate changed from a charge of to a benefit of due primarily to increased tax credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
sales were  in fiscal and zero in fiscal sales relate completely to made in nature company  inc  which was not acquired until june  rental revenue 
rental revenue in fiscal was comparable to fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales relates solely to made in nature company  inc  which was not acquired until june  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from the prior year  primarily as a result of adding made in nature company  inc in june  and costs incurred in the exploration of new strategic initiatives 
interest expense 
interest relating to continuing operations was  in fiscal and zero in fiscal the costs relate solely to shareholder loans made during the year 
interest costs of  in fiscal and  in fiscal are included in discontinued operations 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate increased from percent to percent due primarily to decreased tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash of  at june   borrowings under its line of credit of million and current maturities of long term debt and capital leases of million 
because the company s operations have been subject to seasonality  liquid resources fluctuate during the year 
the company experiences a normal seasonal decrease in production in april 
inventories and borrowings are usually at their peak at this time 
the slowdown in production normally extends through july  although production in the summer of continued through september when the production facility was permanently closed 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company will receive the million proceeds from the sale of its processed apple product lines 
the company plans to use part of the proceeds to pay down the bank line of credit and to retire a significant portion of its long term debt 
there are also significant severance  termination and wind down costs that will be incurred 
the company is also anticipating additional cash flow from the liquidation of its existing inventories and receivables and the sale of the remaining plant equipment 
during fiscal the company invested  in property  plant and equipment used in continuing operations and  used in discontinued operations 
during the year the company incurred million in long term mortgage debt which was used to fund the minco acquisition 
historically  the company s operating capital has been obtained from a combination of internal and external sources 
the largest external source has been a revolving line of credit provided by a bank at its prime rate of interest  which is secured by the company s assets 
as of june   the company had an outstanding balance of million on a maximum available line of million 
this credit facility was initially scheduled to expire in november however  as a result of the sale of the discontinued operations  the bank amended the agreement in august   reducing the maximum line of credit to million with an expiration date of december  in the prior fiscal year  the company had million of debt outstanding as of june  on a maximum bank line of million 
as of june   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants related to its outstanding debt 
the company received a waiver of the non compliance from its bank 
the total purchases of plant and equipment of million consisted of the purchase of new and the reconditioning of existing equipment related to the manufacturing operation as well as certain structural repairs needed to maintain the value of building improvements 
in fiscal  the company had performed a review of its information technology it systems and determined that they were not year compliant 
as a result  a new computer system with related hardware was installed during the current fiscal year at a cost of million 
the related it expenditures were partially financed through capital lease arrangements of  these leases are divided into two components one for hardware for  and the other for software  including installation by an outside consulting firm  for  the leases are payable over three and four years  respectively  and include a buy out option 
management feels that upon the sale or close down of the discontinued operations  the new system may far exceed the company s future requirements 
the company anticipates that the existing system will be written off in fiscal the company is at present exploring the purchase of a much simpler and less expensive system that is also year compliant 
until recently  the company s real estate activities had consisted of the leasing of an idle production facility and rental of a small portion of space in its operating facility 
most of the previously existing space has been rented 
with the closure of the plant as a result of the sale of the processed apple product lines  the company intends to convert all of its former plant space to industrial rentals by outside parties 
the new space available for leasing includes a mix of offices  production buildings and warehouses plus approximately  square feet of cold storage 
the company is actively seeking to attract wineries and food processors to occupy the space
