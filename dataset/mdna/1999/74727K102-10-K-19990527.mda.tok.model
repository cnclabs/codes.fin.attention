the company continues to evaluate appropriate courses of action including the effect of year on replacement of certain systems at its foreign locations 
the company does not expect the costs associated with year compliance of its foreign subsidiary to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
all costs for corrective actions associated with year compliance will be funded with cash flow generated from operations and expensed as incurred 
risks of year issues the company participates in the electronic data interchange program maintained by many of its larger customers including home depot  lowe s  homebase and hechinger builders square 
the company s principal customers have provided written notification advising the company that they are in the process of  or have been  addressing year compliance 
failure by any of these principal customers to adequately address these year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company has contacted its significant suppliers and other service providers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company is currently evaluating supplier responses to date and is not yet in a position to fully assess any third party s compliance efforts with the year issues or the actual expected impact on the company if any third party s year compliance efforts fail 
the company presently expects to complete the evaluation by october  however  based upon preliminary analysis  the company does not believe that the costs  if any  that the company would incur as a result of any failure of its suppliers to address their year issues would have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
this assessment is based upon a preliminary inquiry into this matter  management may determine that this assessment is incorrect and there can be no assurance that the final assessment of this matter will not differ significantly from the preliminary conclusions 
the costs associated with year compliance of the company s foreign subsidiary and the costs associated with any year non compliance on the part of third parties with which the company does business are based on management s best estimates  utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  the existence of third party modification and contingency plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that those estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the ability of  and the resources available to  third parties on which the company relies to address year issues  and similar uncertainties 
contingency plans in an attempt to mitigate the above risks  the company  by october   will develop contingency plans for its foreign locations and any unplanned interruptions arising from the date change as well as from the failure of any third party s compliance
