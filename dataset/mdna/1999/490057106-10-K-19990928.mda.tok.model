the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues for these periods consisted of net sales  research and development revenue and royalty income 
revenues increased to million in the year ended june  fiscal from million in the year ended june  fiscal 
net sales of products increased while research and development revenue decreased from the prior year 
royalty income increased from the prior year 
the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of complete f angio seal commercial devices as well as increased sales of commercial bioabsorbable polymer and collagen products to third parties  including the sale of components for the f angio seal device to the strategic alliance partner 
the sale of the f angio seal devices was related to the product launch in europe in april of while increases in sales of angio seal components came as a result of increased demand for the f product in the us and european markets 
the decrease in research and development revenues was due to a reduction in angio seal research and development activity as the f angio seal transitioned from the development phase to a commercial product 
going forward  the company expects research and development revenue to be nominal as its new strategic alliance partner  st 
jude  plans to perform the majority of the ongoing angio seal research and development in house 
royalty income increased to million from million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users in fiscal compared to  units sold in fiscal the increase in royalty income reflected the launch of the f angio seal in europe in fiscal as well as increased demand for the f angio seal in both the us and european markets in fiscal versus fiscal in addition  the company received a million supplemental royalty payment in fiscal from tyco  the previous owner of the angio seal licensing agreements 
as the company s strategic alliance partner continues to increase production and enhance marketing efforts for the angio seal product line in the united states and in europe  the company expects royalty income to continue as a significant source of revenue 
royalty rates are based on volume of units sold rates decline as certain cumulative unit sales levels are reached and are equivalent in both the domestic and foreign licensing agreements 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase reflects greater net sales of products  which created a more favorable product mix resulting in a favorable gross margin trend 
research and development expense  including regulatory and clinical expenses  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is mainly attributable to increased development efforts in revascularization technology as the company applied for and received its investigational device exemption ide from the fda for the avs and prepared for the initiation of clinical trials of the device 
the company is also expanding its development efforts in the area of absorbable biomaterials as it continues to work with new customers as well as on proprietary products in the polymer and collagen markets 
these increases in expense were offset by the ongoing shift of development of the angio seal to the company s strategic alliance partner in tandem with the commercialization of the f product 
the company expects research and development expense to continue to increase as it investigates and develops new products  conducts clinical trials and seeks regulatory approval for its proprietary products 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of legal expenses incurred related to the company s ongoing patent infringement suit 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was due to an increase in the company s outstanding debt from million at june  to million at june  interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of an increase in average total cash and investment balances 
other non operating income remained constant at  for fiscal and fiscal fiscal other non operating income represented primarily a net gain on the sale of fixed assets while fiscal represented miscellaneous nonrecurring items 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues for these periods consisted of net sales  research and development revenue  milestone fees and royalty income 
revenues increased to million in the year ended june  fiscal from million in the year ended june  fiscal 
net sales of products and research and development revenue both increased from the prior year while royalty income increased 
the increase in net sales was mainly attributable to an increase in angio seal components sold to the company s strategic alliance partner  as a result of increased demand in the us and european markets  as well as the expansion of the company s third party business with other collagen and polymer customers 
approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal the increase in royalty income represented a full year of angio seal us sales royalties compared to nine months of us sales royalties in fiscal  a significant increase in demand in the us and european markets and an increase in total royalty per unit resulting from the patent acquisition agreement see note of the financial statements 
the increase in research and development revenue related to contract research and development  including clinical trials  from the strategic alliance partner for additional sizes of and product enhancements to the angio seal product line 
the million milestone fee represented the final milestone under the license agreement and was earned by the company upon receipt of fda approval in the first quarter of fiscal cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase reflected greater net sales of products offset by manufacturing inefficiencies realized in the start up phase of production for the new sizes of the angio seal  the f and f  and new biomaterials products during the fiscal year 
research and development expense  including regulatory and clinical expenses  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company expanded the development of additional angio seal sizes and biomaterials products  including resorbable polymers and collagen  and increased clinical trial activity 
in addition  the company significantly expanded its development in revascularization technology as it targeted commencement of clinical trials on the avs in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  in fiscal from fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain outside professional fees 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to cash equivalent and investment balances in the first quarter of fiscal  which included funds used in the repayment of the credit agreement 
total cash and investment balances have remained relatively constant since that time 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this decrease is also a result of the repayment of a credit agreement with the company s strategic alliance partner in october offset by amounts drawn under the company s line of credit during the current fiscal year and interest charges recorded in relation to the obligation under the company s patent acquisition agreement 
during fiscal  the company received million in final settlement for the business interruption portion of their insurance claim related to the roof collapse 
of this amount   was recorded as other income 
other non operating income decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal fiscal represented miscellaneous nonrecurring items while fiscal represented primarily a net gain on the sale of fixed assets 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by the company s operating activities during fiscal was million  and net cash provided by the company s operating activities during fiscal was  in fiscal  changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a million use of cash  which was offset by a net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
in fiscal  changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a million use of cash offset by net income of  and depreciation of million 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal  primarily representing machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements related to the continued expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities  principally its collagen and polymer product lines 
the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at june  in addition  the company had million in restricted investment accounts not included in the million 
the company has pledged million in investments as collateral to secure bank loans made to employees for the payment of taxes incurred by such employees as a result of their receipt of common stock at the time of the ipo 
in exchange for the company s pledging this collateral  the employees have pledged their common stock as collateral to the company 
the company also had million in investments restricted for capital spending through june  under the terms of a financing arrangement described below 
the company has a million captital spending plan for fiscal year for the continued expansion and improvement of its exton manufacturing facility 
in january  the company entered into a million financing agreement with a bank the financing agreement 
under the terms of the financing agreement  the bank purchased the company s million tax exempt bond issue the bond issue  which was issued through the local development authority 
the company used  of the proceeds of the bond issue to pay down the balance under its existing million term loan 
the remaining proceeds of the bond issue were placed into a certificate of deposit the cd from which withdrawals are restricted for capital expenditure purposes only 
the company received a million royalty advance under the license agreement upon receipt of fda approval of the angio seal in fiscal year this royalty advance continues to be reduced as the company exceeded minimum royalty stipulations under the licensing agreement 
in november  the company acquired patents under a patent acquisition agreement in exchange for  shares of common stock and a series of eight quarterly cash payments  which began on march   totaling million 
the patents were recorded on the balance sheet at the value of the shares on the date of the agreement plus the present value of the million cash and any legal and other related costs incurred to acquire such patents 
the present value of the cash payments million was recorded on the balance sheet with a remaining balance at june  of  the company plans to continue to expend substantial resources to fund clinical trials to gain regulatory approvals and to continue to expand research and development activities particularly for its revascularization technology and biomaterials products 
the company believes cash generated from operations as well as funds available under financing arrangements with its bank will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as interest paid on its debt 
the company s investment portfolio consists primarily of high quality us government securities and certificates of deposit with an average maturity of one year or less 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in what it believes are the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
at june   the company s total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments  all of which had maturities within one year 
additionally  the company generally holds securities until maturity 
therefore  the company does not expect its results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
the company has  in fixed rate debt  for which the risk would be an inability to refinance if rates decreased 
the remaining million of the company s debt fluctuates with the us treasury rate and is therefore subject to increases in us interest rates 
the estimated potential reduction in earnings from a one point increase in the five year us treasury rate for the year ended june  would have been approximately  year compliance the company is aware of computer program issues associated with existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value from to the issue is whether computer systems and embedded controls will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to year compliance issue 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations and normal business activities 
the company has completed its assessment of potential year issues and the associated potential risks 
the company has assessed the impact of the year issues and believes that its business products and services will not be significantly impacted 
the company has identified all financial  informational and operational systems and found that all critical processes incorporating these systems are compliant 
the company is verifying the readiness of its significant customers and suppliers  including its strategic alliance partner  through the distribution of a questionnaire 
this process was substantially completed as of june  the company does not warrant  however  that these companies year compliance activities will be completely successful 
the company continues to monitor the situation and refine its contingency plans as appropriate 
the company began work on the computer year compliance issue in fiscal year software applications  hardware and related information and non information technologies have been upgraded or replaced to ensure that all systems are year compliant 
replacing hardware or software in this fashion is considered a normal cost of doing business and is being expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
management does not anticipate that the costs of year compliance will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the company does not presently expect that its operations will be materially affected by problems with its computer systems or those of third parties with whom it deals 
statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company cautions that a number of important factors could cause the company s actual results for fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
these important factors include  without limitation  the time  effort and priority level that the company s strategic alliance partner attaches to the angio seal and the strategic alliance partner s ability to successfully manufacture  market and distribute the angio seal  the company s ability to manufacture angio seal components  the results of ongoing clinical trials for the avs and other products and timing of additional regulatory approvals in the united states and in countries outside of europe including japan  announcements of technological innovations or the introduction of new products by the company  its customers or its competitors  competition of puncture closure and occluded svg devices in general  general business conditions in the healthcare industry and general economic conditions 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the common stock
