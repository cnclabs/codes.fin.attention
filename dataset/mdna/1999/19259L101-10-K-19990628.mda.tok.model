the company  through super laundry  its wholly owned subsidiary  is also a laundromat equipment distribution company 
sources of revenue the company s primary financial objective is to increase its cash flow from operations 
cash flow from operations represents a source of funds available to service indebtedness and for investment in both internal growth and growth through acquisitions 
the company has experienced net losses during the past three fiscal years 
such net losses are attributable in part to significant non cash charges associated with the company s execution of its growth strategy  namely  high levels of amortization of contract rights and goodwill related to the addition of new machines and customers through acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the company s most significant revenue source is its route business  accounting for approximately of its revenue 
the company provides outsourced laundry equipment services to locations by leasing laundry rooms from building owners and property management companies  typically on a long term  renewable basis 
in return for the exclusive right to provide these services  most of the company s contracts provide for commission payments to the location owners 
commission expense also referred to as rent expense  the company s single largest expense item  is included in laundry operating expenses and represents payments to location owners 
commissions may be fixed amounts or percentages of revenues and are generally paid monthly 
also included in laundry operating expenses are the costs of machine maintenance and revenue collection in the route business  including payroll  parts  insurance and other related expenses  the costs of sales associated with the equipment distribution business and certain expenses related to the operation of retail laundromats 
in addition to commission payments  many of the company s leases require the company to make advance location payments to the location owners

ebitda margins improved to approximately of revenues for the current year compared to approximately of revenues for the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to the effect of cost efficiencies related to the consolidation of the above mentioned acquisitions into the company s operations  as well as internal growth 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues increased by approximately for the fiscal year  as compared to the fiscal year 
this improvement in revenues resulted primarily from the company s execution of its acquisition strategy and increased route revenues resulting from internal expansion 
based on the historical revenues of acquired businesses  the company estimates that approximately million of its revenue increase for the fiscal year was primarily due to the kwik wash acquisition january  the reliable acquisition april and the national coin acquisition july 
the ali acquisition january and the macke acquisition march also contributed to the revenue increase  but had minimal impact due to the timing of these transactions 
in addition  during the fiscal year  the company s installed machine base increased by approximately  machines from internal growth excluding the machines added from the macke acquisition  the reliable acquisition  the ali acquisition and the national coin acquisition during such period as compared to an increase of approximately  machines from internal growth during the prior year s corresponding period 
included in internal growth are acquisitions of small  local route operators and new customers secured by the company s sales force

general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million or for the fiscal year  as compared to the fiscal year 
the increase for the year was due to various expenses associated with i costs and expenses relating to the company s acquisition strategy  including systems development and refinement relating to the integration of prior acquisitions and ii additional expenses  such as accounting  management information systems and other administrative functions related to the company s growth

the extraordinary items for the fiscal year consisted of costs related to the extinguishment of debt in february and the termination of the then existing revolving credit facility 
ebitda represents earnings from continuing operations before deductions for interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is used by management and certain investors as an indicator of a company s historical ability to service debt 
management believes that an increase in ebitda is an indication of a company s improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
however  ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the period  nor has it been presented as an alternative to either a operating income as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or b cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
interest expense  net  increased by approximately for the fiscal year  as compared to the fiscal year  due primarily to increased borrowing levels under the amended and restated credit facility in connection with certain acquisitions  as well as the increased interest due to the bond offering

as the company has focused on increasing its cash flow from operating activities  it has made significant capital investments  consisting primarily of capital expenditures related to acquisitions  renewals and growth 
the company anticipates that it will continue to utilize cash flows from operations to finance its capital expenditures and working capital needs  including interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year were approximately million including approximately million relating to capital lease obligations 
of such amount  the company spent approximately million in acquisition and related transaction costs  primarily due to the g t acquisition and the cleanco acquisition  and approximately million related to the net increase in the installed base of machines of  machines 
the balance of approximately million which consists of machine expenditures  advance location payments and laundry room improvements was used to maintain the existing machine base in current locations and through replacement of discontinued locations and for general corporate purposes 
the full impact on revenues and cash flow generated from capital expended on acquisitions and the net increase in the installed base are not expected to be reflected in the company s financial results until subsequent reporting periods  depending on certain factors  including the timing of the capital expended 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions and internal growth  will be approximately million for the twelve months ending march  such increase relative to the fiscal year is attributable primarily to the company s recent acquisition activities 
while the company estimates that it will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to finance anticipated capital expenditures  there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so 
the company s working capital requirements are  and are expected to continue to be  minimal since a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are not paid until after cash is collected from the installed machines 
in connection with certain of the financing agreements governing the company s indebtedness  the company is required to make monthly cash interest payments as required by the amended and restated credit facility and semi annual cash interest payments as required by the senior notes 
management believes that the company s future operating activities will generate sufficient cash flow to repay indebtedness outstanding under the senior notes and borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility or to permit any necessary refinancings thereof 
an inability of the company  however  to comply with covenants or other conditions contained in the indentures governing the senior notes or in the credit agreement evidencing the amended and restated credit facility could result in an acceleration of all amounts due thereunder 
if the company is unable to meet its debt service obligations  it could be required to take certain actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness  selling additional equity capital or other actions 
there is no assurance that any of such actions could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or on terms permitted under the amended and restated credit facility or the indentures governing the senior notes 
certain accounting treatment the company s depreciation and amortization expenses  aggregating approximately million for the fiscal year  have the effect of reducing net income but not operating cash flow 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  a significant amount of the purchase price of businesses acquired by the company is allocated to contract rights  which costs are amortized over periods of up to years 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company s comprehensive year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff and outside consultants 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and that transactions with customers  suppliers and financial institutions are fully supported 
during the fiscal year  the company assessed the year readiness of its information technology it and non it systems 
the company determined that it needed to modify significant portions of its it systems so that such systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company has substantially completed its it systems transformation and is currently verifying the year compliance of these systems 
in addition  as part of its year initiative  the company has contacted its significant suppliers  customers and financial institutions to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company is continuing to assess the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to properly address their year readiness 
based on this review  the company does not expect the computer systems of those operations to have a material adverse effect on the companies operations 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address the year issue  there can be no guarantee that its computer systems or the computer systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the operations of the company 
the cost of the year initiative is not expected to be material to the company s results of operation  financial condition or the cash flows 
inflation and seasonality in general  the company s laundry operating expenses and general and administrative expenses are affected by inflation  and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the company in future periods 
management believes that such effects will not be material to the company 
the company s business generally is not seasonal

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates on its borrowings 
the company s cash flow would be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates

the new expiration date is november  the company s fixed debt instruments are not generally affected by a change in the market rates of interest  and therefore  such instruments generally do not have an impact on future earnings 
however  as fixed rate debt matures  future earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in interest rates related to debt acquired to fund repayments under maturing facilities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
