impact of year certain of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  such older computer programs could misinterpret a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  many computer applications with this defect could fail or create erroneous results 
the company s year compliance is directed by senior management and includes four main projects 
information technology  operating equipment with embedded chips or software  products  and third party suppliers and customers 
these projects generally include four phases assessment assessing equipment and systems for potential year non compliance  remediation developing solutions to correct year non compliance  testing testing the developed solutions for effectiveness  and implementation implementing the fully tested solutions 
the following chart is a summary of our year compliance schedule target dates resolution phases assessment remediation testing implementation e information complete complete complete complete x technology p expected completion expected completion o date  june date  august s u operating complete complete complete complete r equipment with e embedded chips or software expected completion expected completion expected completion t date  april date  may date  june y p products complete complete complete complete e rd party complete complete for complete for completion for suppliers and for system system interface system interface system interface customers interface expected develop contingency expected completion implement contingency completion for plans date for system plans or alternatives as surveying vendors  as appropriate  interface work  necessary  june april april june we believe our year compliance will be completed on schedule  but the schedule is based on a number of factors and assumptions 
these assumptions include the accuracy and completeness of responses by third parties to our inquires and the availability of skilled personnel to complete the compliance work 
the compliance schedule could be adversely impacted if any of the factors and assumptions are incorrect 
we cannot give assurance that our year compliance projects will be completed on schedule or that we will not uncover year issues that could create a material impact on the operation of the company 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer system failures  equipment shutdowns or improperly dated business records 
the amount of such potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company is in the process of working with third party vendors and customers to ensure that the company s systems that interface directly with third parties are year compliant by april although management believes a significant interruption in our suppliers and customers activities due to year issues is unlikely  such as interruption could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not believe that the cost of our year compliance will be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
the cost of year compliance is not expected to exceed million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  we have spent approximately million on year compliance 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in may and determine whether such a plan is necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in the interest rate as a result of its borrowings under the senior credit facility 
however  at december  the company had a swap agreement that effectively converted million of the company s debt to a fixed rate 
if market interest rates for the remaining borrowings under the senior credit facility average more during the year ended december  than they did during  the company s interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management could take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
the company s swap agreement in place at december  had a notional amount of million and ran through june  the agreement required the company to pay interest at a defined fixed rate of while receiving interest at a defined variable rate of three month libor at december  
this swap effectively converted million of the company s term loan a to a fixed rate 
the additional net interest expense recorded in both and as a result of the swap agreement was not material 
at december   the swap agreement had a negative fair market value of approximately million as determined by the lender 
in connection with the amendment of the company s senior credit facility in february  the swap agreement was terminated 
the company expects to enter into a new swap agreement with a million notional amount during the second quarter of
