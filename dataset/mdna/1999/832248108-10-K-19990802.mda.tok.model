prior to june   circle four was accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
results of operations the consolidated results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal were favorably affected by significantly lower live hog and raw material prices 
in fiscal  hog prices fell to their lowest level in five decades 
these prices were the primary reason for the substantially improved profits in the company s mpg and the losses incurred in the hpg 
fiscal and included weeks of operations compared to fiscal  which included weeks of operations 
accordingly  sales and all expense categories in fiscal and reflect the impact of one less week of operations compared to fiscal consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal sales in fiscal decreased million  or from fiscal the decrease in sales reflected a decrease in unit sales prices of meat products as the result of significantly lower raw material live hog prices passed through to customers in the form of lower unit selling prices 
this decrease was nearly offset by a increase in mpg sales tonnage due to the inclusion of the sales of schneider  sbs and north side and increased volumes at existing operations 
cost of sales decreased million  or  in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in live hog costs partially offset by the increased sales tonnage 
gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to substantially higher margins in the mpg 
fresh pork margins improved substantially  reflecting the impact of the lower cost of raw materials live hogs and margins on increased sales tonnage of both fresh pork and processed meats 
mpg gross profits were partially offset by substantial losses in the hpg due to lower live hog prices

including the nonrecurring charge  net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales in fiscal were flat compared to fiscal sales reflected a decrease in unit sales prices of meat products  as a result of lower raw material live hog prices passed through to customers in the form of lower unit selling prices  offset by a increase in mpg sales tonnage 
the increase in sales tonnage reflected an increase in the number of hogs slaughtered and the inclusion of a full year of the sales of lykes 
cost of sales decreased million  or  in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in live hog costs offset by the increased sales tonnage 
gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in gross profit reflected sharply improved margins on higher sales of both fresh pork and processed meats 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the operations of lykes and to higher selling  marketing and product promotion costs associated with intensified efforts to market branded fresh pork and processed meats 
depreciation expense increased million  or  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to completed capital projects at several of the company s processing plants and to the inclusion of the operations of lykes for the full fiscal year

meat processing group fiscal compared to fiscal mpg sales in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease reflected a decrease in unit sales prices as the result of sharply lower raw material live hog prices passed through to customers 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in sales tonnage due to the inclusion of the sales of schneider  sbs and north side and increased volumes at existing operations 
the increase in sales tonnage reflected a increase in fresh pork tonnage  increase in processed meats tonnage and increase in the tonnage of other products 
fresh pork tonnage increased as the result of the inclusion of the sales of schneider and a full fiscal year of second shift operations at john morrell s sioux city  iowa plant compared to less than a full year of second shift operations in fiscal the increase in processed meats tonnage resulted from the inclusion of the sales of schneider  sbs and north side and increased tonnage at existing operations despite a sharp drop in hot dog exports to russia 
the mpg reported profit before income taxes of million in fiscal compared to profit before income taxes of million in fiscal this increase reflected sharply lower raw material live hog costs and the impact of acquired businesses and increased volumes from the base business 
these increases were partially offset by increased marketing and distribution expenses incurred to market branded fresh and processed meat products and expenses related to preparing the company s information systems for the year fiscal compared to fiscal mpg sales in fiscal were flat compared to fiscal sales reflected a increase in tonnage offset by a decrease in unit sales prices as a result of lower raw material live hog prices passed through to customers in the form of lower unit selling prices

the fresh pork tonnage increase was primarily related to an increase in the number of hogs slaughtered at the company s sioux city  iowa and bladen county  north carolina plants 
the increase in processed meats tonnage was primarily related to a full fiscal year of sales at lykes compared to six months of sales in fiscal the mpg reported a profit before income taxes of million in fiscal compared to profit before income taxes of million in fiscal this increase reflected sharply improved margins as a result of significantly lower raw material live hog costs  which were partially offset by higher selling  marketing and product promotion costs associated with intensified efforts to market branded fresh pork and processed meats 
hog production group fiscal compared to fiscal hpg sales were relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a decrease in the unit selling price of live hogs  due to an oversupply of hogs in the market  was offset by a increase in the number of hogs sold  primarily the result of including the sales of circle four 
intersegment sales to the mpg are eliminated in the consolidated statements of income 
the hpg reported a pretax loss of million in fiscal  compared to a pretax loss of million in fiscal the substantially higher loss was primarily the result of the lower unit selling prices of hogs  which were at their lowest levels in five decades 
despite the near term weakness in live hog prices  management expects the hpg to return to profitability in fiscal through the utilization of hedging and price risk management techniques and expected increases in hog prices toward the end of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal hpg sales in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal the increase reflected a increase in the number of hogs sold as a result of increased production at brown s 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the unit selling price of live hogs  reflecting an overall industry expansion in hog production 
substantially all hpg sales in fiscal and were to the mpg and  accordingly  are intersegment sales which were eliminated in the consolidated statements of income 
the hpg reported a loss before income taxes of million in fiscal compared to a profit before income taxes of million in fiscal this is due to significantly lower selling prices for live hogs which were not offset by lower feed costs 
liquidity and capital resources the pork processing industry is characterized by high sales tonnage and rapid turnover of inventories and accounts receivable 
because of the rapid turnover rate  the company considers its inventories and accounts receivable highly liquid and readily convertible into cash 
borrowings under the company s credit facilities are used to finance increases in the levels of inventories and accounts receivable resulting from seasonal and other market related fluctuations in raw material costs 
the demand for seasonal borrowings usually peaks in early november when inventories are at their highest levels  and borrowings are repaid in january when accounts receivable are collected 
net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase primarily reflected higher earnings and noncash charges 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company expended million for several business acquisitions see note and million for capital expenditures 
these capital expenditures included renovations and expansion projects at several of the company s processing plants  additional hog production facilities at circle four and replacement systems associated with the year in fiscal  the company expended million for business acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
as of may   the company had definitive commitments of million for capital expenditures primarily to increase its processed meats and value added fresh pork capacities at several of its processing plants 
the company has continuing plans to increase its processed meats and hog production businesses through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures  both in the united states and internationally 
these investing activities will be funded with cash from operations  borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities and the issuance of additional shares of the company s common stock 
effective may   the company completed the acquisition of cfi and its affiliated companies and partnership interests for million shares of the company s common stock and the assumption of approximately million in debt  plus other liabilities see note

there were no borrowings under the facilities as of may  management believes that through internally generated funds and access to global credit markets  funds are available to adequately meet the company s current and future operating and capital needs 
long term debt and capital lease obligations increased to million as of may  from million as of may   primarily due to the debt assumed in business acquisitions 
the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization decreased to as of may  from as of may  the decrease reflected increases in equity  resulting from earnings  common stock issued in connection with business acquisitions and stock option exercises 
risk management substantially all of the company s products are produced from commodity based raw materials  corn and soybean meal in the hpg and live hogs in the mpg 
the cost of corn and soybean meal the principal feed ingredients for hogs and live hogs are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions  economic conditions  government regulation and other unforeseen circumstances 
the pricing of the company s fresh pork and processed meats is monitored and adjusted upward and downward in reaction to changes in the cost of the underlying raw materials 
the unpredictability of the raw material costs limits the company s ability to forward price fresh pork and processed meat products without the use of commodity contracts through a program of price risk management 
the company uses price risk management to enhance its ability to engage in forward sales contracts  where prices for future deliveries are fixed  by purchasing or selling commodity contracts for future periods to reduce or eliminate the effect of fluctuations in future raw material costs on the profitability of the related sales 
while this may tend to limit the company s ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity price fluctuation  it also tends to reduce the risk of loss from adverse changes in raw material prices 
in addition  the company utilizes commodity contracts for live hogs and corn to manage hog production margins when management determines the conditions are correct for such hedges 
the particular hedging methods employed and the time periods for the contracts depend on a number of factors  including the availability of adequate contracts for the respective periods for the hedge 
the company attempts to closely match the commodity contract expiration periods with the dates for product sale and delivery 
as a result  gains and losses from hedging transactions are recognized when the related sales and purchases are made 
as of may  and may   the company had deferred million and million  respectively  of unrealized hedging gains on outstanding futures contracts 
as of may  and may   the company had open futures contracts with contract values of million and million  respectively 
as of may  and may   the company had deposits with brokers for outstanding futures contracts of million and million  respectively  which were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
for open futures contracts  the company uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of commodities will have on these commodity derivative instruments 
as of may   the potential change in fair value of open future contracts  assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  was million 
year the year problem relates to computer systems that have date sensitive programs that were designed to read years beginning with  but may not recognize the year company information technology it systems including non it systems and third party information systems that fail due to the year may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the year issue has the potential to affect the company s supply  production  distribution and financial chains 
the company began addressing the potential exposure associated with the year during fiscal management has approved the plan necessary to remediate  upgrade and replace the effected systems to be year compliant 
a corrective five point action plan was developed including analysis and planning  allocation of resources and commencing correction  remediation  correction and replacement  testing  and development of contingency plans 
the company has identified and defined the critical it and non it projects 
these projects relate to systems which include any necessary technology used in manufacturing or administration with date sensitive information that is critical to the day to day operations of the business 
of the critical it projects  have been completed  are in correction and replacement  and the remaining  less critical projects are being analyzed and planned 
all critical it system implementations and remediations are expected to be substantially completed by the end of july the non it plant projects have identified system components that have a potential issue with rolling dates into the year of these components  are fully compliant and the others are at various stages of progress in the action plan 
substantially all critical non it system implementation and remediation is complete or in final stages 
the cost of the year solution  including hardware and software replacement  is expected to be approximately million  of which million has been expended to date 
the company has expensed approximately million in fiscal the company estimates million of the million will be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these expenditures are anticipated to continue through december third party risk is being proactively assessed through inquiries and questionnaires 
significant vendors  electronic commerce customers and financial institutions have been sent inquiries about the status of their compliance for the year additionally  the company will follow up the inquiries and questionnaires with interviews 
this process is expected to be an ongoing evaluation 
at this point management cannot determine the level of risk associated with third parties 
the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns 
the company is developing a worst case scenario and contingency plan that includes an evaluation of the criticality of each manufacturing process and the determination of possible manual alternatives  including the purchase of additional inventory and related storage for production supplies 
the company  while substantially complete on all critical and non critical it and non it systems  continues to assess the year readiness of animex see note and cfi see subsequent events below and note 
the preliminary review of cfi s year readiness is complete 
approximately of the critical systems are compliant 
the remaining systems are targeted to be compliant by september  management has not determined the level of readiness for animex 
the assessment is expected to be completed by the end of july the costs of the year solution are exclusive of animex and cfi s remediation efforts 
while the company believes that it is taking the appropriate steps to address its readiness for the year  the costs of the project and expected completion dates are dependent upon the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that could influence the results may include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
subsequent events effective may   the company completed the acquisition of cfi and its affiliated companies and partnership interests for million shares of the company s common stock and the assumption of approximately million in debt  plus other liabilities see note 
the acquisition includes of the capital stock of cfi  cfi s interest in smithfield carroll s  cfi s interest in circle four  cfi s interest in tar heel turkey hatchery  of cfi s turkey grow out operation  cfi s interest in carolina turkeys  and certain hog production interests in brazil and mexico
