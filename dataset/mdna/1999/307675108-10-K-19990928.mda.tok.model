item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources registrant continues to maintain a strong working capital position  and management believes cash requirements for the coming year will be provided by internal sources 
registrant has no major commitments for capital expenditures at this time 
in thousands except ratio data current assets    current liabilities    working capital    quick ratio capital expenditures    results of operations the trends that have characterized the past several years continued in a volatile market for green coffee  a large brazilian coffee harvest in coming to market during  lower sales volume  lower roast coffee prices  strong profit margins 
all raw materials have a degree of volatility  and the green coffee market is no exception 
this market has seemed to be even more unsettled since the frosts in brazil  so that perceived coffee shortages have resulted in green coffee cost fluctuations of more than during the past several years 
price declines started during fiscal continued throughout when the record brazilian harvest came to market 
lower costs of raw materials resulted in price pressure on finished goods  and registrant s sales and cost of sales both declined 
sales volume also declined 
net sales reached  in as compared to  in  and  in gross profit decreased to  in  or of sales  compared to  in  or of sales  and  in  or of sales

coffee prices volume cost gross profit allied products gross profit operating expenses other income provision for income taxes change in weighted average shares outstanding net income price risk the company s operations are significantly impacted by the world market for its primary product coffee 
coffee is an agricultural product that is produced in many nations around the world 
although it is consumed in those nations  the largest coffee consuming nation is the united states  followed by the nations of western europe 
green coffee is traded domestically on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange csce  and is one of the largest and most volatile commodity markets 
the most important aspect of the company s operations is to secure a consistent supply of coffee 
some proportion of green coffee price fluctuations can be passed through to registrant s customers  even if lagging the market changes  but maintaining a steady supply of green coffee is essential to keep inventory levels low and sufficient stock to meet customer needs 
registrant purchases all its coffee through established coffee brokers  many of which are large international firms  to help minimize the risk of default on coffee deliveries 
the company purchases much of its coffee on forward contracts  occasionally for delivery as long as six months in the future 
sometimes these contracts are fixed price contracts  regardless of the change in the price of green coffee between the contract and delivery dates 
at other times these contracts are variable price contracts  that allow the delivered price of contracted coffee to reflect the market price of coffee at the delivery date 
the company occasionally uses futures contracts to hedge exposure to coffee price fluctuations 
gains on hedging transactions are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the inventory 
losses on the hedging transactions are recognized in earnings currently and the company s green coffee inventory is adjusted currently through its lifo methodology 
futures contracts not designated as hedges  and terminations of contracts designated as hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the company had no open contracts at june   and year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computers with embedded chips or computer programs with date sensitive software could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year miscalculations and system failures could result in the temporary inability of a company to process transactions  invoices and other normal business operations 
state of readiness costs the company evaluated its operations and found its non information technology areas manufacturing  packaging  trucking have little exposure 
information systems are the primary source of registrant s year issues 
registrant has identified and resolved system deficiencies using a combination of reprogramming existing software  conversion to new systems and or hardware  and eliminating certain systems 
the company does not believe its ability to operate its major accounting  billing and inventory control systems will be effected 
the company s costs of correcting its year issues have been expensed as incurred and the amounts have not been material 
registrant does business with many vendors 
the company is not aware of any external party with a year issue that would materially impact registrant s operating results 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents are able to solve any year issues without effecting registrant  nor is there any way for registrant to assess non compliance by external parties 
risks the worst case that might occur to effect registrant is likely to result from external parties far removed from registrant 
utility deliveries  including gas for the roasters  electricity  and telephone  could all have an effect on registrant  depending on the length and timing of delivery failures 
registrant relies on raw materials that are agricultural products  primarily coffee  produced and shipped from around the world 
it is not possible to determine whether green coffee processing including milling and packaging and shipping  including port operations  customs and ocean freight carriers will be able to make raw material deliveries without delay 
registrant maintains several weeks supply of green coffee  but it is not known whether such stocks will be needed 
the costs of delayed or cancelled raw material shipments cannot be estimated at this time 
in general  disruptions in the domestic economy could also have a negative impact on registrant s customers and their ability to use and pay for the company s products 
the amount of lost or delayed revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
contingency plans there is no formal contingency plan at this time 
the company will maintain a sizable green coffee inventory  and determine whether additional steps including manual procedures  staffing needs and adjusting branch inventory levels should be taken as the key date approaches 
accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting changes are described in note to the consolidated financial statements

a basis point move in the general level of interest rates would result in a change in the market value of the portfolio of approximately  the company is exposed to market value risk arising from changes in interest rates on its portfolio of preferred securities 
the company reviews the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enters into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b holds put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  the company attempts to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates 
the company does not transact in futures contracts or put options for speculative purposes 
the following table demonstrates the impact of varying interest rate changes based on the preferred stock holdings  futures and options positions  and market yield and price relationships at june  this table is predicated on an instantaneous change in the general level of interest rates and assumes predictable relationships between the prices of preferred securities holdings  the yields on us treasury securities  and related futures and options

commodity hedge instruments are sometimes used  depending on market conditions 
as of june  there were no open hedge positions
