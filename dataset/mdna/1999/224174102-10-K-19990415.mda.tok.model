item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is in the business of identifying  acquiring  owning and strategically managing controlling interests in other operating companies 
in october  the company  along with its affiliates  rei and citadel  entered into the stock transaction described below under the reorganization and stock transactions  which resulted in transferring a majority of the company s assets to rei in exchange for rei equity securities 
accordingly  at december  and  the company s consolidated book value and cash flows are principally derived from its holdings in rei 
at december   the company owned reading entertainment  inc rei common stock and rei series b preferred stock representing approximately of the voting power of that company  and  shares of citadel common stock  which  together with the  shares of citadel common stock held by reading  represented approximately of the outstanding common stock of citadel 
as used in this item  the term the consolidated company is used to describe  for accounting purposes  the company reporting on a consolidated basis its ownership interest in rei and collectively with its subsidiaries  reading 
the company is not consolidated with reading for federal income tax purposes  does not have common financing with reading  does not guarantee the obligations of reading and maintains separate offices from reading 
since  reading has been principally engaged in the beyond the home or real estate based segment of the entertainment industry 
over the past five years  reading has reviewed and pursued a number of cinema acquisition opportunities 
however  in the view of management  both existing operations and new build opportunities have generally been over priced in the us market 
consequently  reading has attempted to concentrate efforts on markets which  in the view of management  offer better potential returns than the exhibition of conventional film product in the highly competitive united states market 
these markets have included the australian  new zealand and puerto rican markets for conventional film exhibition and the united states market for upper end art and foreign film 
furthermore  in australia and new zealand  reading has focused on a development oriented approach  emphasizing the construction of new multiplex cinemas on properties owned by the consolidated company 
this development oriented approach has meant that a longer period of time has been required to convert reading s cash and cash equivalent assets into income producing assets than would have been the case if reading had acquired existing cinemas 
it has also meant that the consolidated company has had significantly higher general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than would a mature cinema exhibition company  or a company not actively involved in long term real estate development 
in addition  the consolidated company has retained most of the senior executive staff needed to carry reading through its development phase and to operate its cinema and real property assets  even though most of reading s screens are currently in development and are not anticipated to be producing material income in the next year 
at the end of  reading  either directly or through its various joint venture relations  had screens in operation 
based solely upon the development of locations as to which the company has signed letters of intent  leases  or current ownership of the land  this number should increase to approximately screens by the end of the consolidated company believes that this strategy will ultimately result in greater profitability and better long term returns including both operating profits from exhibition and long term gains from real estate development  than would the purchase of an existing conventional cinema circuit 
this is particularly true given the significant number of obsolete cinemas held by most of the circuits which have been offered for sale in page recent periods 
reading has entered into an agreement to purchase four existing cinemas in manhattan  but has done so on the basis of the belief that a greater presence in manhattan is important to the further development of a domestic art circuit and that the development of new cinemas by reading in manhattan was not a viable option 
this basically development oriented strategy will necessarily mean lower reported profits in the initial periods until operating revenues increase to cover general and administrative expense  and until the long term rewards of real estate ownership are realized 
reading has begun the development of circuits in australia and new zealand 
at the end of  reading australia had four cinemas with screens 
reading australia anticipates adding an additional six cinemas with screens in  for a total of screens 
reading new zealand has entered into a joint venture with an experienced operator 
that joint venture now operates two modern multiplex theaters in the auckland area  and has a third cinema under construction  which is scheduled to open in in australia and new zealand  reading is attempting to take advantage of the foot traffic generated by a successful multiplex theater by developing entire entertainment centers 
these centers typically include a state of the art multiplex cinema  complementary restaurant and retail uses  and convenient parking  all on land owned by reading 
due to the competition for suitable cinema sites  and reading s view that currently attractive markets in australia and new zealand will likely be developed in a relatively short period of time  reading has attempted to maximize the number of potential cinema locations by purchasing or otherwise acquiring rights to acquire a number of entertainment center sites over the past months 
this has adversely effected short term profitability  as significant amounts have been invested in undeveloped land  or land which is otherwise not currently income producing 
however  it has given reading a level of assurance that it will have the sites available to it needed to execute its business plan for australia and new zealand 
to date  the consolidated company s development activities have been funded with cash resulting  in large part  from the disposition of the stater bros 
preferred stock and citadel preferred stock 
a significant portion of this cash   has gone from interest earning cash balances and short term investments to non income producing property which is currently under development or held for development 
the consolidated company s assets remain largely unencumbered 
it is clear  however  that the consolidated company will need to borrow funds in order to complete its currently planned buildout and development projects 
the consolidated company believes that it should be able to raise the capital needed to fund its build out  as currently staged over the remainder of  and in  reading determined to expand its beyond the home entertainment activities from cinemas into live theater 
during the latter portion of that year  reading entered into agreements to purchase seven live theaters 
three of these theaters are in manhattan the minetta lane  orpheum and union square 
the remaining four are located in a single complex  the royal george  in chicago 
all of these theaters feature smaller off broadway type plays 
the acquisition of the royal george theater in chicago was completed in march it is anticipated that the acquisition of the manhattan theaters will close in the second quarter of this year 
in addition  reading recently entered into an agreement giving it the right  through may  to present plays at the marines theater  in san francisco 
accordingly  reading anticipates booking eight live theaters in three major metropolitan areas by mid page results of operations due to the nature of the consolidated company s development and acquisition activities and the timing associated with the results of such activities  the effect of the gains recorded with respect to the consolidated company s investment in stater  the effect of litigation awards and settlements  the stock transactions  the timing of new cinema openings and acquisition and the long term nature of the real estate development activities  historical revenues and earnings have varied significantly 
the entertainment center developments are  for the most part  in the early stage of development and generally will not produce income or cash flow for at least eighteen to twenty four months from the time that all development approvals have been secured and construction commenced 
it is anticipated that one of reading s eight entertainment center projects currently under development will open late in accordingly  general and administrative expenses related to such real estate development activities will not be supported by operating income in the near term 
further  although the consolidated company s cinema operations are anticipated to expand significantly during  the consolidated company anticipates operating at a loss in  since many of the new cinemas are not expected to commence operations until the fourth quarter of and most of the consolidated company s real estate activities will continue in the development stage 
in addition  interest and dividend revenues will decrease as the consolidated company deploys its cash and cash equivalents in its real estate and cinema development projects

the stock transactions described below transferred the title of a material portion of the company assets from craig to rei  resulting in craig s assets being principally comprised of rei common and preferred stock 
accordingly  the future liquidity of craig is principally dependent on reading s ability to pay dividends in accordance with the terms of the reading preferred stock amounting to approximately  annually 
to date  reading has declared and paid such dividends  however  the company can make no assurances that reading would not choose to allow such dividends to accumulate in order to further its business plan described below

since reading determined to become principally involved in the beyond the home or real estate based segment of the entertainment industry in  it has funded its development activities principally from cash derived from the disposition of its historic railroad assets and other operating interests 
in  in view of the substantial capital resources required to take advantage of the opportunities available to it in this industry  the consolidated company entered into the stock transaction which had the result of providing reading with substantial liquid resources 
although reading still has little or no debt  the consolidated company s cash assets are now  in essence  fully committed 
a substantial portion of the cash has been invested or internally committed to development projects which will not be generating revenue until the latter portion of or early in addition  approximately  has been invested in land  currently held for development as entertainment centers  and million has been invested in a acre development site in melbourne  which though initially acquired as an entertainment center site  is now being reviewed for possible alternative development 
these assets are  in large part  presently unencumbered 
to the extent that assets are encumbered with mortgage debt  such debt exists primarily at the level of certain of reading s unconsolidated affiliates  such as wpg 
this decision to commit substantial resources to the acquisition of sites reflects the company s view that the key to the successful penetration of the australian market page was the acquisition of a sufficient number of sites to assure the potential to develop a critical mass of cinema assets  and the need to acquire these sites before the major cinema operators in australia could control the markets which will be serviced by these sites 
reading believes that it has sufficient cash on hand to complete the projects and acquisitions currently slated for completion in this includes the anticipated addition of screens in australia increasing the screen count in that market from to screens  screens in the united states increasing the screen count from to screens  screens in puerto rico increasing the screen count from to screens  and screens in new zealand increasing the screen count from to screens 
it is the current plan to leverage these assets as they commence operations  and to use the proceeds from such financings to continue the development program through the year it is estimated that the total development cost of all of reading s entertainment center projects will exceed  in the event that such debt financing cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to reading  consideration will be given to seeking joint venture partners  issuing debt or equity securities  delaying development of certain projects and or selling land currently held for development  or other assets 
reading is also in discussion with various lenders concerning the possibility of construction period finance 
reading does not currently consider any of its assets to be held for sale 
reading does have commitments in excess of its current cash and cash equivalent assets 
at december   reading had total commitments of  of this amount  it is currently anticipated that approximately  will be funded in  and approximately  will be funded in or after included among these commitments is a  credit facility to be made available by reading and a  option payment to be funded in connection with the cinema transaction both of which are unlikely to be funded before the fourth quarter of  a contractual obligation to construct an entertainment center in victoria  at an estimated remaining cost of  currently anticipated to be completed in late or early  a  obligation to purchase a  stall car park structure located adjacent to property located in central wellington  and held for entertainment center development by an unconsolidated entity in new zealand  and  in obligations to acquire additional open land in new zealand 
as a consequence of business plan for australia and new zealand  reading is carrying significantly more land than might be the case with a more mature cinema company 
the acquisition of these properties has required the commitment of significant sums 
since the acquired properties are not currently income producing  the financing of such assets is more difficult and more expensive than would be the financing of cash flowing assets 
accordingly  the ability for reading to continue its buildout program will be dependent in large part upon the performance of the approximately new screens being constructed in while care has been taken in the identification of these cinemas  no assurances of success can be given 
for this and a variety of other reasons  including without limitation both local and international economic issues  the availability of financing on reasonable terms  and the health generally of the film exhibition industry in the markets serviced by reading  no assurances can be given that the financing needed for the company to carry out its business plan into and to meet its longer term commitments can be given

the book value of the assets transferred by craig to rei were as follows citadel preferred stock  stater bros 
preferred stock  ownership interest in reading international  gross book value of assets received  plus accrued and unpaid dividends the stock transactions were intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in a exchange  the party acquiring the assets in the stock transactions  rei retains the contributing parties tax basis in the acquired assets  with no taxable gain recognized as a result of the exchange 
the parties contributing assets in the stock transactions  craig and citadel obtain a basis in the assets received in the exchange equal to the basis in the assets which are contributed in the exchange the series a and series b preferred stock 
with the exception of the stater preferred stock  the book value of the assets received in the stock transactions approximated the tax basis in the assets received 
craig s adjusted tax basis for federal tax purposes in the stater preferred stock was approximately  the estimated federal tax liabilities associated with the assets transferred in the stock transactions was approximately  primarily relating to the stater preferred stock 
at the time of the closing of the stock transactions  rei had a gross deferred federal tax asset of  and a tax asset valuation allowance the tava in the same amount

the acquisition of rei securities by craig has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values  after consideration of the recognition by rei of previously reserved deferred tax assets as of the date of the stock transactions

in december  the stater preferred stock was contributed to reading australia 
management believes that the gain for federal tax purposes resulting from that transfer was offset by rei s nol carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of rei has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs would agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of rei 
while the transfer restrictions which are applicable to rei s equity securities are intended to minimize the risk of such ownership changes  ownership changes unknown to the company may have occurred despite or in violation of such page restrictions 
in addition  the code and related case law limit the ability to use nols to offset certain built in gains on contributed property 
although the consolidated company does not believe that such limitations on the use of its nols applied to the contribution by rei of the stater preferred stock to reading australia  there can be no assurance that the irs would not take a different position 
the irs is presenting examining reading s tax return 
if the irs were to determine that the principal purpose of the stock transactions was to make use of the nols and the consolidated company could not show otherwise  such use may not be available 
in such case  the financial position of the consolidated company could be materially adversely affected 
rei issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for the assets received in the stock transactions 
the series a preferred stock issued to citadel has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if rei fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
in addition to issuing to citadel the series a preferred stock  rei also granted the asset put option  which under certain circumstances permits citadel to exchange substantially all of its assets for rei common stock 
for financial statement purposes no value was allocated to the asset put option due in part to the subjective nature of the assumptions utilized in option pricing models and the fact that stock option valuation models are intended to value options and the asset put option is not transferable
