item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general shell transactions 
on june   we acquired the lopi transaction louisiana onshore properties inc lopi  an indirect subsidiary of shell oil company shell  pursuant to a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with lopi 
the consideration paid in the lopi transaction consisted of  shares of our common stock  
par value common stock  and a new issue of convertible preferred stock the preferred stock that is convertible into  shares of common stock  which together provided shell louisiana onshore properties inc  an indirect subsidiary of shell slopi  with beneficial ownership of of our common stock on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants and conversion of all preferred stock 
in a transaction separate from the lopi transaction  we also acquired on june  from shell western e p inc  an indirect subsidiary of shell swepi  various other oil and gas property interests located onshore in south louisiana for a total cash consideration of million the swepi acquisition 
the lopi transaction and the swepi acquisition together  the shell transactions were effected to increase our reserves  lease acreage positions and exploration prospects in louisiana and are expected to substantially increase our production and cash flow 
the shell transactions were accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  operations relating to the shell properties are included in our results of operations beginning with the third quarter of revenues and production from the shell properties accounted for of our total revenue and production during the second half of cairn merger 
on november   we consummated a merger the cairn merger with cairn energy usa  inc cairn 
in connection with the cairn merger  we issued approximately million shares of common stock 
the cairn merger more than doubled our then existing proved reserves and substantially increased our production and cash flow 
the cairn merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and our historical financial statements and operating results and the discussion of such results in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been restated to reflect the combined operations of the company and cairn for the periods presented 
we recorded a one time charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately million for costs associated with the cairn merger 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
in this regard  average worldwide oil and natural gas prices have decreased substantially from levels existing during as a result of these declines  the price received by us during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december   which has negatively impacted our revenues and cash flow during these industry conditions  and any continuation thereof  will have several important consequences to us  including decreasing the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  delaying the timing of exploration of certain prospects and reducing our access to capital markets  which could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase its exploration and development program 
ceiling write down 
a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices primarily caused us to recognize million of non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting during  including million during the fourth quarter 
due to the substantial recent volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that future write downs will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
during production increased on a natural gas equivalent basis 
increased production was a direct result of the addition of the shell properties at june   as well as  offshore platforms and new wells brought online in the following table summarizes our operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended percentage december  increase decrease production natural gas mmcf   oil mbbls  mmcfe   average sales price natural gas mcf oil bbl mcfe mcf gross revenues s natural gas   oil   pipeline total   operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to added operating expenses related to the inclusion of costs and expenses from the shell properties as well as new wells brought on production in the last twelve months 
on a mcfe basis lease operating expenses increased in to 
from 
in this increase was primarily attributable to the fact that operating costs for the more mature fields acquired from shell are higher than those of our existing properties with higher per well flow rates 
the company continues to implement plans to reduce the operating costs associated with the shell properties 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase is largely attributed to the additional production as a result of the purchase of the shell properties  which are located entirely onshore south louisiana and subject to state severance taxes 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to the significant production increase of over interest and other income 
interest and other income remained flat at 
million for as compared to 
million for general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of increases in salaries and wages and related employee costs associated with our expanded exploration and production activities associated with the shell and cairn transactions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is a combination of borrowings of approximately million utilized to fund the purchase of certain properties in the shell transactions and continued borrowings to fund our exploration and development program during impairment of long lived assets 
as previously described  we recorded write downs of million relating to our oil and gas properties due to significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices during income tax expense the company recognized a million deferred income tax benefit in associated with the reduction in the difference between book and income tax bases  principally due to the previously described oil and gas property write downs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
during  production remained relatively flat compared to although we experienced production increases during attributable to the continuing increase in exploration and development activities by us and the addition of new producing wells  those increases were offset by normal declines in oil and natural gas production from older wells as well as a significant decline in production from wells in the southwest holmwood field in louisiana during the third quarter of due to poor production performance from the wells in this field as well as the elimination of production from these wells during the fourth quarter of as a result of the amoco litigation 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  production from certain offshore wells was temporarily interrupted due to a ruptured pipeline

oil and natural gas operating expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to added operating expenses related to additional wells brought on production during as a percentage of operating revenues  oil and natural gas operating expenses increased to for  compared to for this increase is primarily attributable to us placing a higher proportion of oil wells on stream during the year  which historically have had higher operating expenses than natural gas wells 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased 
million to million in  compared to million in this increase is partially the result of increased revenues relating to increased oil production and increased natural gas prices 
in addition  severance and ad valorem taxes in were more heavily affected than in by a louisiana severance tax reduction incentive for new field discoveries and wells drilled below  feet 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily related to a increase in the depletion rate during interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased 
million to 
million for as compared to million for the decrease was due primarily to decreases in cash balances 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and related employee costs associated with our expanded exploration and overall growth activities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to finance our on going exploration and development activities 
impairment of long lived assets 
we recorded a write down of million relating to our oil and gas properties due to significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices during the fourth quarter of merger expenses 
as previously described  we recorded a one time charge of million for costs associated with the cairn merger 
litigation expenses 
as previously described  we recorded a charge of million relating to the amoco litigation 
see legal proceedings 
liquidity and capital resources working capital 
during  our liquidity needs were met from cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of december   we had a cash balance of million and negative working capital of million 
the increase in both the cash balance and working capital from levels existing at december   reflects refinancing of the credit facility to the million borrowing base supported by reserve additions from the company s exploration activities coupled with our increased operating cash flows resulting from the shell transactions 
amended credit facility 
in may  we amended and restated our credit facility with the chase manhattan bank as administrative agent the credit facility to provide for maximum borrowings  subject to borrowing base limitations  of up to million 
in november  we amended the credit facility to increase the then existing borrowing base from million to million 
the borrowing base currently set at million is scheduled to be redetermined on march  in addition to regularly scheduled semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders under the credit facility have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time once during each calendar year and we have the right to obtain a redetermination by the banks of the borrowing base once during each calendar year 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by pledges of the outstanding capital stock of our material subsidiaries and a mortgage of all of the company s offshore oil and natural gas properties and several onshore oil and natural gas properties 
in the event of a default  we are obligated to pledge additional properties representing  in the aggregate  at least of our present value of proved properties 
the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on cash dividends on the common stock 
borrowings under the credit facility mature on may  under the credit facility  as amended  we may secure either i an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of the administrative agent s prime rate  a certificate of deposit based rate or federal funds based rate plus to or ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate plus to  depending on our ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
the credit facility also provides for commitment fees ranging from 
to 
per annum  a one time drawdown fee on first time borrowings in excess of million  and certain closing fees aggregating million paid in november in connection with the increase in the borrowing base 
at march   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility 
based upon the fact that drilling results have resulted in significant increases in proved reserves and the fact that oil and gas prices have remained relatively flat  we currently do not believe that our borrowing base under the credit facility will be reduced from its current million level as a result of the redetermination that will take place effective as of march  however  the lenders under the credit facility have not yet completed their review of the borrowing base and have made no formal determination as to the borrowing base level  and there can be no assurance that a reduction will not occur 
any reduction in the borrowing base by the lenders could cause us to delay planned capital expenditures and drilling projects or possibly result in us being required to repay borrowed amounts exceeding the borrowing base 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures excluding the shell transactions during consisted of million for property and equipment additions related to exploration and development of various prospects including leases  seismic data acquisitions  and drilling and completion costs 
we currently expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million and anticipate that such capital expenditures will be funded from cash flows from our producing properties and borrowings under the credit facility 
availability of capital to fund our exploration and development program will depend upon the success of our drilling program and the nature and extent of capital expenditures required for development of discoveries 
in this regard  we anticipate that based on our current product price and production forecast  internal cash flow and borrowings permitted under the credit facility should fully fund our capital expenditure program as currently anticipated 
dividends 
it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that we will pay dividends with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
the preferred stock issued upon closing of the lopi transaction accrues a quarterly cash dividend of of its stated value with the dividend ceasing to accrue incrementally on one third of the shares of preferred stock on june   and so that no dividends will accrue on any shares of preferred stock after june  dividends on the preferred stock aggregating million were accrued or paid during stock rights and restrictions agreement 
in light of the large ownership position issued to slopi in the lopi transaction and in recognition of both our and slopi s desire that the company function as an independent oil and gas company  we entered into a stock rights and restrictions agreement with slopi that defines and limits slopi s and our respective rights and obligations 
these agreements limit slopi s and its affiliates control while protecting their interests in the context of certain extraordinary transactions by i allowing slopi to maintain representation on our board of directors  ii restricting slopi s and its affiliates ability to effect certain business combinations with us or to propose certain business combinations with us  iii restricting the ability of slopi and its affiliates to sell certain portions of their shares of common stock and preferred stock  subject to certain exceptions designed to permit them to sell such shares over time and to sell such shares in the event of certain business combinations involving us  iv limiting slopi s and its affiliates discretionary voting rights to of the total voting shares  except with respect to certain extraordinary events and in situations in which the price of the common stock for a period of time has been less than per share or we are in material breach of our obligations under the agreements governing the lopi transaction  v permitting slopi and its affiliates to purchase additional of our securities in order to maintain a beneficial ownership interest of the common stock if we propose to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock  vi extending certain statutory and corporate restrictions on business combinations applicable to slopi and its affiliates and vii obligating us  at our option  to issue a currently indeterminable number of additional shares of common stock in the future  or pay cash  in satisfaction of a make whole provision contained in the stock rights and restrictions agreement in the event slopi receives less than approximately per share on the sale of any common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock 
slopi currently is restricted from selling shares of common stock owned by it until june  beginning on june   slopi may sell of the common stock owned by it and may sell an incremental of the common stock owned by it each year until june   at which time it is free to sell all common stock owned by it 
in the event slopi sold all common stock issued on conversion of the preferred stock at the market prices existing on march   our make whole obligation would be approximately million  which we may satisfy at our option in cash or common stock  which could significantly dilute all holders of our common stock other than shell  or significantly reduce our ability to raise additional funds for exploration and development 
year we are currently conducting a company wide year readiness program yk program 
the yk program is addressing the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year to remain functional 
we anticipate that our year compliance will be substantially complete by may our yk program is divided into three major categories i internal information and accounting it systems  ii non it equipment and systems and iii third party suppliers and customers 
the general stages of review with respect to each of the categories are a identifying and assessing items or systems that are not year compliant  b assessing costs and expenses associated with the various alternatives for remedying items and systems that are not year compliant and c repairing or replacing items that are determined not to be year compliant 
we are in varying stages of review with respect to each category within our yk program 
we have completed our review of our it equipment and systems and currently believe that our internal information and accounting systems are year compliant  except for certain field software that we currently do not believe are material to our operations 
we currently are reviewing various alternatives for making such field software year compliant  and believe the costs associated therewith will not be material 
we currently are in the process of reviewing our non it equipment and systems 
we do not believe such equipment and systems will present any material year issues 
at present  we have not identified any non it equipment and systems that are not year compliant that cannot be remedied or replaced at minimal cost to us 
we have begun our assessment of third party year issues during the first quarter of our third party review initially consists of written inquiries to third party suppliers  subcontractors and customers requesting information and representations from such third parties as to their readiness for the year we are in the process of circulating these responses and  based upon such responses  will determine the necessity for requesting additional information as appropriate 
we expect our initial review of third parties to be substantially complete during the second quarter of we believe we have alternative suppliers and product customers to mitigate material exposure if certain of our current suppliers and customers are determined not to be year ready 
management believes that it has taken reasonable steps in developing its yk program 
notwithstanding these actions  there can be no assurance that all of our year issues or those of our key suppliers  subcontractors or customers will be resolved or addressed satisfactorily before the year commences 
if our key suppliers  subcontractors  customers and other third parties fail to address their year issues  and there are no alternatives available to us  then our usual channels of supply and distribution could be disrupted  in which event we could experience a material adverse impact on its business  results of operations or financial position 
in addition  although we believe our internal planning efforts are adequate to address our internal year concerns  there can be no assurances that we will not experience unanticipated negative consequences and material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which could have material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we currently are unable to estimate the most reasonably likely worst case effects of the arrival of the year and currently do not have a contingency plan in place for any such unanticipated negative effects 
we intend to analyze reasonably likely worst case scenarios and the need for such contingency planning once our review of third party preparedness described above has been completed  and we expect to complete this analysis by september  it is anticipated that the total costs related to the year issue will not exceed  the majority of which will be incurred by us in to date  there have been no material deferments of other it projects resulting from the work taking place on our yk program 
forward looking information from time to time  we may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of and that involves risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to  exploration and seismic acquisition plans  anticipated results from current and future exploration prospects  the anticipated results of wells based on logging data and production tests  future sales of production  earnings  margins  production levels and costs  market trends in the oil and natural gas industry and the exploration and development sector thereof  environmental and other expenditures and various business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing including  but not limited to  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of our filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the success of our exploration and development program  changes in the price of oil and natural gas  which could cause us to delay or suspend planned drilling operations or reduce production levels  risks relating to the availability of capital to fund drilling operations and our current estimates of our need for additional capital  which can be adversely affected by adverse drilling results  production declines  declines in oil and gas prices and declines in the overall economy  world wide political stability and economic growth  our successful execution of internal exploration  development and operating plans  risks inherent in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  including risks of fire  explosion  blowout  pipe failure  casing collapse  unusual or unexpected formation pressures  unusual or unexpected weather conditions  litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of business  environmental hazards and other operating and production risks  which may temporarily or permanently reduce production or cause initial production or test results to not be indicative of future well performance or delay in timing of sales or completion of drilling operations  environmental regulation and costs  regulatory uncertainties and legal proceedings 
the risks related to the year  and the dates on which we believe our yk program will be completed  are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of our yk program 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the interconnection of global businesses  we cannot ensure our ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue that may affect our operations and business or expose us to third party liability
