an accident  involving an explosion and fire  occurred on february   at jahn foundry corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company located in springfield  massachusetts 
nine employees were injured and there have been three fatalities 
the damage was confined to the shell molding area and boiler room and other areas of the foundry are operational 
molds are currently being produced at other foundries as well as jahn foundry while the repairs are made 
although no lawsuits have been filed  a number of attorneys representing the injured and deceased employees have contacted jahn foundry regarding possible litigation 
the company carries insurance for property and casualty damages  business interruption  general liability and worker s compensation for itself and its subsidiaries 
the company  its property insurance carrier and its insurance broker dispute the amount of property insurance available for property damages suffered in this accident

the company believes that its operating cash flow and amounts available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund its capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next two years 
however  the level of capital expenditure and working capital requirements may be greater than currently anticipated as a result of the size and timing of future acquisitions  or as a result of unforeseen expenditures relating to compliance with environmental laws or the accident at jahn 
acquisitions have been financed with borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and occasionally with common stock 
market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities in the us  canada and europe and utilizes fixed and floating rate debt to finance its global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to its foreign operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countreis in which its largest foreign operations are located 
in the normal course of business  the company uses derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its market risks 
additional information regarding the compan ys financial instruments is contained in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flow associated with such changes 
the company s principal currency exposures are in the major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
for and  the company s exposure to market risk has been estimated using sensitivity analysis  which is defined as the change in the fair value of a derivative or financial instrument assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices 
the company believes that the sensitivity analysis is a better portrayal of its value at risk and is more readily understood than the tabular presentation used in  and  as a result  has changed to the sensitivity analysis presented 
the company used current market rates on its debt and derivative portfolio to perform the sensitivity analysis 
certain items such as lease contracts  insurance contracts  and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits were not included in the analysis 
the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 
actual changes in interest rates or market prices may differ from the hypothetical changes 
the company s primary interest rate exposures relate to its cash and short term investments  fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swaps  which are mainly exposed to changes in short term interest rates eg  usd libor 
the potential loss in fair values is based on an immediate change in the net present values of the company s interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change in interest rates 
the potential loss in cash flows and earnings is based on the change in the net interest income expense over a one year period due to an immediate change in rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would have a material impact on the company s earnings of approximately  in both fiscal and the company s exposure to fluctuations in currency rates against the pound sterling and canadian dollar result from the company s holdings in cash and short term investments and its utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge customer receivables and firm commitments 
the potential loss in fair values is based on an immediate change in the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a shift in exchange rates versus the pound sterling and canadian dollar only 
the potential loss in cash flows and earnings is based on the change in cash flow and earnings over a one year period resulting from an immediate change in currency exchange rates versus the pound sterling and canadian dollar only 
based on the company s holdings of financial instruments at june  and  a hypothetical depreciation in the pound sterling and and the canadian dollar only versus all other currencies would have a material impact on the company s earnings of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s analysis does not include the offsetting impact from its underlying hedged exposures customer receivables and firm commitments 
if the company included these underlying hedged exposures in its sensitivity analysis  these exposures would substantially offset the financial impact of its foreign currency forward exchange contracts due to changes in currency rates 
inflation management believes that the company s operations have not been adversely affected by inflation or changing prices 
year computer issues the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its hardware and software systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the identified issues 
the company believes that  with replacement or modification of its existing computer systems  updates by vendors and conversion to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
the company expects to complete implementation of computer systems that are year compliant in the first quarter of fiscal  although testing may continue in the second quarter of fiscal based on its review of non information technology systems to date  the company does not anticipate the need to develop an extensive contingency plan for such systems or to incur material costs in that regard 
the company relies on a number of customers and suppliers  including banks  telecommunication providers  utilities  and other providers of goods and services 
the inability of these third parties to conduct their business for a significant period of time due to the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is currently assessing the year compliance of its significant customers and suppliers 
to date  the company has been advised by over two thirds of its significant customers that they will be year compliant by the end of calendar there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies that interact with the company will be sufficiently year compliant 
the company s reliance on single source suppliers  however  is minimal  and the company seeks to limit sole source supply relationships 
the company  however  has entered into national service agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and freight service from single sources 
if the company does not identify or fix all year problems in critical operations  or if a major supplier or customer is unable to supply raw materials or receive the company s product  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially impacted 
year project expenditures to date total approximately million 
the company expects to incur an additional  of additional costs 
the company presently anticipates that it will complete its year assessment and remediation by september  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its year implementation plan according to the anticipated schedule due to the potential lack of availability of trained personnel and their ability to identify relevant computer codes  among other uncertainties 
forward looking statements statements above in the subsections entitled general  liquidity and capital resources  market risk and year computer issues such as believes  expects  intends  contemplating and statements regarding quarterly fluctuations  statements regarding the adequacy of funding for capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next two years and similar expressions that are not historical are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements include the company s expectations as to future performance 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements are the following the size and timing of future acquisitions  business conditions and the state of the general economy  particularly the capital goods industry and the markets served by the company  the strength of the us dollar  canadian dollar  british pound and the euro  interest rates  inflation  the availability of labor  the successful conclusion of contract negotiations  the results of any litigation arising out of the accident at jahn  the competitive environment in the casting industry and changes in laws and regulations that govern the company s business  particularly environmental regulations 
new accounting standards for a discussion of new accounting standards  see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
supplemental quarterly information the company s business is characterized by large unit and dollar volume customer orders 
as a result  the company has experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in its net sales and net income from quarter to quarter 
generally  the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker than the other quarters as a result of plant shutdowns for maintenance at most of the company s foundries as well as at many customers plants 
in addition  the company s operating results may be adversely affected in fiscal quarters immediately following the consummation of an acquisition while the operations of the acquired business are integrated into the operations of the company
