item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies have a material effect on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and generally follow premium levels 
for more than a decade  lower premium rates have prevailed among property casualty insurance carriers resulting in heavy competition for market share 
this soft market ie  lower premium rates has generally resulted in flat or reduced renewal commissions 
in recent years insured losses have reached into the billions of dollars 
substantial mergers  both domestically and internationally  have resulted in fewer insurance companies 
increased underwriting losses and reduced competition tend to raise premium rates 
in spite of these forces  there have been mitigating factors including a favorable equity market  increased underwriting capital more supply of insurance product and economies of scale after consolidations  all of which tend to lower premium rates 
the net result is that property casualty premium rates have remained low 
management believes these conditions in the insurance marketplace will continue and overall premium pricing will remain under pressure and not improve in historically  increased property replacement costs due to inflation and increasingly large litigation awards have caused some clients to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
these factors generally have the effect of generating higher premiums to clients and higher commissions to the company 
in recent years  lower rates of inflation along with increased underwriting capital have resulted in a highly competitive insurance marketplace and flat to lower premiums 
in general  the downward trend in premium rates has had a greater effect on the company s revenues than inflation 
although the property casualty insurance pricing environment has resulted in some risk buyers returning to first dollar coverage  management believes the overall trend will continue to move toward the alternative insurance market  which would tend to have a favorable effect on our risk management services segment 
the company anticipates that new sales in the areas of risk management  claims management  insurance captive and self insurance services will continue to be a major factor in the company s fee revenue growth during the company continues to look to the future and to explore not only the core segments of insurance brokerage and risk management services  but also expansion within the alternative insurance markets and financial and related investment services 
management believes these areas continue to hold opportunities for diversification and profitable growth 
results of operations consolidated the company s results of operations for periods prior to have been restated for four acquisitions as if they had operated as part of the company prior to their joining the company 
the company continues to search for merger partners which complement existing operations  provide entry into new markets  add new products and enhance local sales and service capabilities

cash generated from operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because of the variability related to the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable  net cash flows from operations vary substantially from year to year

year compliance computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize the date as the year  rather than the year which could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
with respect to this issue  the company has completed an assessment of its computer systems and software and has substantially completed the necessary modifications or replacements of its existing software so that its computer systems will function properly in the year and beyond 
testing and live use have taken place and will continue into any additional modifications found necessary will be made at that time 
no contingency plans are deemed necessary 
the company has evaluated the impact on operations of the year on non information technology systems and has determined that any potential impact would not be material to the company s operations 
generally  system modifications and replacements and the associated costs were contemplated with normal enhancements and improvements being made in conjunction with updating financial reporting and operating systems 
to date  the cost of compliance has not been material and is not expected to be material in the future 
the company also has an ongoing program to review the status of year compliance efforts of its business partners and vendors 
while the company believes it is taking the appropriate steps to assure the company s year compliance  it is also dependent on business partner  vendor and client compliance to some extent 
consequently  any year compliance problems that may be experienced by the company s business partners  vendors or clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition and future operating results 
no assurance can be given that the company s and these other entities efforts will completely address the year issue 
market risk exposure the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following analysis presents the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the range of changes in interest rates used in the analysis reflects the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
this discussion of market risks related to the company s consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks 
the effect of actual changes in these risk factors may differ materially from the company s estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  including credit risk and legal risk 
these risks are not included in the following analysis 
the company has a comprehensive and diversified investment portfolio 
the company s invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents  investment strategies held as trading and marketable securities held as available for sale 
accordingly  these assets are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio at december  approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio and the resulting fair value was not materially different from the december  carrying value 
at december   the fair value of the company s investment strategies portfolio was million 
from an investment management perspective  this portfolio  which is managed by several outside fund managers  consists of two different components an equity portfolio of million and an alternative investment strategies portfolio of million 
the equity portfolio is subject to equity price risk 
this portfolio  which is not hedged  consists of common stocks and is primarily managed to produce realized gains for the company 
the estimated potential loss in fair value of this equity component at december  resulting from a hypothetical decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges of would be approximately  the company s alternative investment strategies portfolio is also subject to equity pricing risk 
however  these investments are actively managed in order to minimize the company s exposure to equity pricing risk 
the objective of this portfolio is to maximize the overall return to the company  while minimizing the downward price risk in order to preserve the investment s underlying principal balance 
the outside fund managers for these alternative investment strategies hedge their strategies by selling short common equity securities in order to mitigate the effects of changes in equity prices thereby making any such fluctuations immaterial 
accordingly  hypothetical changes in equity prices would not cause the resulting fair value to be materially different from the december  carrying value for this portfolio 
at december   the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio was million  which was million less than its aggregate amortized cost 
the overall objective of this portfolio is to provide the company with a stable after tax yield 
this portfolio  which is not hedged  primarily consists of dividend yielding preferred stocks 
accordingly  this portfolio is more sensitive to interest rate risk than it is to equity pricing risk 
the estimated potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term interest rates at december  would be approximately million 
at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings under the line of credit facilities approximated the carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december  and the resulting fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily due to the fact that its united kingdom based subsidiaries incur expenses denominated in british pounds while receiving their revenues in us dollars 
the company does not hedge this foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as they are incurred 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a weakening of the us dollar  earnings before income taxes would decrease by approximately million 
the company is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
however  it is management s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to the company s consolidated operating results or financial position 
the company manages the balance sheets of its foreign subsidiaries such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets thereby maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the following the company s commission revenues are highly dependent on premiums charged by insurers  which are subject to fluctuation  the property casualty insurance industry continues to experience a prolonged soft market low premium rates thereby reducing commissions  lower interest rates will reduce the company s income earned on invested funds  the insurance brokerage and service businesses are extremely competitive with three competitors being substantially larger than the company  the alternative insurance market continues to grow which could unfavorably impact commission and favorably impact fee revenue  the company s revenues vary significantly from period to period as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the net effect of new and lost business production  the general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact on the company s renewal business  the company s operating results and financial position may be adversely impacted by exposure to various market risks such as interest rate  equity pricing and foreign exchange rates  and the company s year compliance efforts depend upon compliance efforts of the company s business partners  vendors and clients 
the company s ability to grow has been enhanced through acquisitions  which may or may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which  if consummated  may or may not be advantageous to the company 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
attention is also directed to other risk factors set forth in documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission
