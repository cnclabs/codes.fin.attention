the strong cash flow performance resulted primarily from net earnings for of  and decreases in inventories and accounts receivable of  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities in was  as capital expenditures and payments related to the cooper transaction were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of businesses and property  plant and equipment 
for the three years ended december   and capital expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities in of  was primarily due to the repayment of  in borrowings from bank lines  and  in principal repayments on long term financing 
dividends paid for the three years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
in the first two quarters of the company suspended the dividend due to a deterioration in financial performance 
the dividend was reinstated in the third quarter of as the company s financial results and prospects greatly improved 
on november   the company entered into a new three year revolving credit facility with eight lending institutions  providing for a  unsecured line of credit 
the facility allows the company to select from two interest rate options  one based on a spread over the prime rate and the other based on a spread over libor 
the spread above each interest rate option is determined by the company s ratio of consolidated debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these rates should compare favorably with the short term credit rates obtained by the company during most of and as such should result in lower interest costs in compared to also in  the company will explore various options for raising additional long term capital to fund future growth opportunities and further strengthen its balance sheet 
at december   the company was not in compliance with certain covenant requirements associated with certain long term notes payable  however the company received the appropriate waivers and certain amendments were made to the note agreements 
the amendments contained  among other things  provisions for the payment of up front fees of and an increase in the interest rates on each note payable of 
the increased interest rate was reduced by basis points when the company refinanced its short term credit facility on november  and a further reduction is possible as the company s balance sheet is strengthened 
in  the company s required long term debt repayments will be approximately total debt current and non current at december  decreased by  as compared to december  this was mainly due to decreased requirements to support inventories and accounts receivable 
the company continues to aggressively pursue ways to reduce inventories 
significant efforts are focusing on pack to order systems and improved requirements forecasting systems 
pack to order systems retain parts in a bulk state until an order is received for a specific brand of product 
part ii continued the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately  primarily for new machinery and equipment 
the company anticipates that its present sources of funds and the new multi year facility entered into during will continue to be adequate to meet its near term needs 
the reductions in capital employed by the company  coupled with our increased earnings has resulted in a significant year over year improvement in economic value added eva 
the company has expanded its eva focus to ensure that capital is invested wisely in programs that exceed our cost of capital and improve our asset utilization 
comparison of to net sales in were  an increase of  or from the comparable period in excluding revenues from acquisitions not present in  total net sales increased by  or  as compared to sales increases in the temperature control division  reflecting market share gains  product line expansions and the impact of an extremely hot summer were partially offset by sales declines in the engine management division reflecting the weakness in the automotive aftermarket and reduced sales to aps  one of the company s largest customers  as it worked its way through bankruptcy proceedings 
sales remain focused in the us  as of sales were to domestic customers 
sales to canada  europe and other export markets remained relatively flat in cost of goods sold increased by  from  to  gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from to 
this decline reflects a higher mix of temperature control products with lower average gross margins than engine management products 
gross margins also were negatively affected by the cooper transaction due to the higher carrying cost of the acquired inventory compared with comparable products produced by the company s existing temperature control business 
the majority of this inventory was sold in and temperature control gross margins should improve in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in  excluding bad debt expenses  increased by  or  while net sales increased 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses excluding bad debt expenses decreased from to 
the point improvement in sg a expenses resulted primarily from lower new customer acquisition costs and the partial integration of the cooper industries temperature control business into the existing temperature control infrastructure 
selling expenses also were reduced  as a further restructuring of the sales force was completed 
other income expense  net  decreased by  primarily due to losses related to the company s joint ventures 
the company s earnings before interest and taxes increased to million from million in this increase was a direct result of the cost reductions discussed above  combined with the non recurrence of the million in bad debt expense recorded in  due to the bankruptcy filing of aps  inc interest expense increased by  to  resulting from several factors including  interest costs related to discontinued operations in and higher average interest rates in partially offsetting lower outstanding borrowings during when including interest expense related to discontinued operations  interest expense decreased by  primarily as a result of lower outstanding borrowings 
in  the company focused significant attention on reducing debt and strengthening its balance sheet 
total debt was reduced by  and the company succeeded in completing a multi year part ii continued committed revolving credit line 
in addition  receivables were reduced by  inventories were reduced by  and cash and short term investments increased by  the progress made in asset management and debt reduction is reflected by a reduction in the company s total debt to capitalization percentage from in to in income tax expense related to continuing operations in was  compared to a benefit of  in  when the company posted a net loss 
earnings from the company s puerto rico and hong kong subsidiaries resulted in a effective tax rate that is lower than the statutory corporate rate in the us the company has largely completed its restructuring program and is now entirely focused on the two product lines where it is a market leader 
in and into the year  it is anticipated that the full impact of our cost reduction programs will take effect and that synergies from the consolidation of the cooper temperature control business and other acquisitions will begin to be fully realized and provide further earnings benefits 
comparison of to net sales in were  up from sales of  in excluding revenues from acquisitions not present in  net sales remained relatively flat as compared to sales increases in the temperature control division  reflecting market share gains and product line expansions  were offset by sales declines in the engine management division reflecting the general weakness in the automotive aftermarket 
cost of goods sold increased  from  to  gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from to 
this decline reflects a higher mix of temperature control products and non traditional business which have lower gross margins and reduced manufacturing efficiencies  as production schedules were lowered to reduce inventories 
selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations in  excluding bad debt expenses  increased by or  and as a percentage of net sales from continuing operations  increased from to 
the increase in these expenses resulted primarily from a  provision for severance payments related to personnel reductions  higher new customer acquisition costs  increases in overhead costs as a result of the filko acquisition these costs are reduced significantly in as filko has been integrated into the company and finally due to increases in costs to support the company s high technology oe programs 
bad debt expenses from continuing operations  increased significantly in as a result of the bankruptcy filing of aps  inc  a major customer 
the company continued to supply aps  inc 
on a limited basis in  but did not subject itself to any additional exposure 
other income expense  net  from continuing operations decreased by  primarily due to lower interest income as available cash early in was used to reduce short term borrowings under credit lines 
interest expense from continuing operations  increased by  to  resulting from higher average interest rates 
taxes based on earnings  from continuing operations  reflect a benefit of  for as compared to expense of  for the significant decrease in tax expense is a result of the losses incurred by the company during the current year tax benefit recognized was a function of the significant part ii continued losses from the company s us operations being partially offset by earnings of the company s puerto rico and hong kong subsidiaries  which have lower tax rates than the us statutory rate 
the combination of the foreign earnings and domestic losses results in a favorable effective tax rate of against losses 
impact of inflation although inflation is not a significant issue  the company s management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings 
this will be achieved principally by cost reduction programs and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
future results of operations the company continues to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins  the company is continuing to focus on overhead and cost reduction 
the company has completed much of its restructuring program  and is now focused on the two industry segments in which it can become the market leader 
the company anticipates that significant synergies will continue to develop from the consolidation of cooper industries temperature control business with the company s existing temperature control business 
these synergies began to develop during and should have a material favorable impact on the and results 
additional cost reductions in other areas that were implemented in should have significant benefits in these actions  coupled with the continued focus on eva  will ensure that the company invests only in programs that exceed the cost of capital and focus on improving margins and asset utilization 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company has established a comprehensive response to its year exposure 
generally  the company has year exposure in two areas i its information technology it systems and ii its non it systems 
at june  the company had completed an inventory of its internal it systems and made a preliminary determination of which programs were or were not year compliant 
during the period ending december  the company tested each significant it system which is believed to be year compliant 
in some cases  year issues will be corrected in the development of new programs  which enhance or provide new functionality to these financial and management operating systems 
the company expects the cost of this effort will be approximately million  which includes the costs for new computers and related equipment 
the company expects to substantially complete year testing and remediation on its it and non it systems by june the company is nearly complete with its interviews of suppliers  customers  financial institutions and others with which it conducts business to determine the extent to which the company would be vulnerable to these third parties failure to remediate their own potential year problems 
the inability of the company or these other significant business partners to adequately address the year issues could cause disruption of the company s operations 
the company does not presently anticipate that the cost to address the year issue will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
part ii continued although the company expects its internal it and non it systems to be year compliant as described above  the company intends to prepare a contingency plan that will specify what it plans to do if it or important external companies are not year compliant in a timely manner 
these contingency plans will address the most likely worst case year scenarios 
these plans are expected to be finalized during the second quarter of recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in values of derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than the company s functional currency  which is the us dollar 
similarly  the company is exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of its financing 
the company does not use any significant derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign currency options  interest rate swaps and interest rate agreements  to manage these risks  nor does it hold or issue derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
exchange rate risk the company has exchange rate exposure  primarily  with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the company s financial instruments which are subject to this exposure amount to approximately million  which includes million of indebtedness of the company  million in accounts payable and million of accounts receivable 
the potential immediate loss to the company that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
in addition  if such a change were to be sustained  the company s cost of financing would increase in proportion to the change 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on the company s foreign currency denominated revenues 
since consistent and simultaneous unfavorable movements in both relevant exchange rates is unlikely  this assumption may overstate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the company s results of operations 
interest rate risk at december  the company had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
the company invests its excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
due to the fact that the majority of the company s debt is at fixed rates with various maturities and due to the short term nature of cash investments  the potential part ii continued loss to the company over one year  that would have resulted from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rates applicable to financial assets and liabilities on december  would not be expected to have a material impact on the earning or cash flows of the company 
however  due to seasonality with respect to the company s short term financing  which are at variable rates  the market risk may be higher at various points throughout the year 
the company s existing three year credit facility provides a million unsecured line of credit  subject to a borrowing base as defined and consists of two variable based interest options 
depending upon the level of borrowings  under this credit facility  which may at times approach million  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have a material impact on the earnings or cash flows of the company
