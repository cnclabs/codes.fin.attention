the company s net sales increase to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increases in desktop and consumer product sales 
broadcast sales increased slightly and were augmented by the release of thunder and fxdeko 
desktop sales in fiscal increased over fiscal this was driven primarily by increased sales from existing products including the dc  dc  reeltime and dv in addition to sales generated from new product releases notably the dc desktop sales also increased due to the acquisition of truevision in march which added the targa and ready to edit products 
consumer sales increased due to a full year of sales of the studio which was released at the end of fiscal consumer sales also grew due to increased sales of pctv and the introduction of studio dc and studio mp international sales sales outside of north america were approximately and of the company s net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in european sales of consumer products 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its net sales 
gross profit 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  tooling  assembly  testing  and distribution of finished products  warehousing  warranty and service costs  product reworks  provisions for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage  and royalties 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as product mix  licensing fees or royalties paid to third parties  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  and the distribution channels through which products are sold 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margins were aided in fiscal by a favorable product mix 
however  the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience pricing pressures on its products as the industry matures and competition increases 
engineering and product development 
engineering and product development expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million during fiscal as a percentage of sales  engineering and product development expenses decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in fiscal management believes that investment in research and development is crucial to its future growth and position in the industry 
the company expects to continue to allocate significant resources to engineering and product development efforts in mountain view and grass valley  california  paramus  new jersey  gainsville  florida  braunschweig  germany  and indianapolis  indiana 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions paid to independent sales representatives  trade shows  cooperative marketing and advertising expenses and professional fees for marketing services 
sales and marketing expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to promotional costs for the introduction of several new desktop and consumer products in addition to the release of thunder in june sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease reflects a growth in sales exceeding incremental sales and marketing expenditures 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase in the june fiscal year  is partly due to the inclusion of a full twelve months of expenses from the german operations which were acquired from miro in august additional increases were related to the company s overall growth 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  respectively 
in process research and development 
during the year ended june   the company recorded an in process research and development charge of approximately million mostly related to the acquistion of truevision 
during the year ended june   the company recorded an in process research and development charge of approximately million related to the miro acquisition 
the amounts to acquired in process research and development  were based on results of an independent appraisal using established valuation techniques in the high technology industry 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development represents development projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility was determined based on i an evaluation of the product s status in the development process with respect to utilization and contribution of the individual products as of the date of valuation and ii the expected dates in which the products would be commercialized 
it was determined that technologically feasibility was achieved when a product is at beta stage 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to the time of acquisition using a risk adjusted discount rate 
discount rates of and were used for the truevision and miro valuations respectively 
interest income net 
net interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in cash and marketable securities due primarily to the completion of a public offering in november thus  fiscal includes one full year of interest income from these proceeds 
income tax expense 
the company recorded provisions for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was and respectively 
the tax rate in fiscal was significantly lower than the rate in fiscal mainly due to the reduction of the company s valuation allowance as management determined that it was likely that the company would realize a portion of its deferred tax asset 
the tax rate in fiscal reflects the exclusion of non deductible expenses related to acquisitions 
as of june   the company has federal research and experimentation and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million which expire between and  and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million which have no expiration provision 
comparison of years ended june  and net sales 
the company s net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in sales of all three product groups broadcast  desktop and consumer 
the increase in consumer sales resulted from sales of products acquired in the miro acquisition and sales of the videodirector studio and studio  which commenced shipment in march and june  respectively 
broadcast sales increased as a result of increasing sales of dvextreme and lightning  which were first shipped in june  deko  which was acquired in april  and alladinpro which commenced shipment in june  partially offset by a decline in sales of prizm and flashfile 
desktop sales increased as a result of mirovideo dc sales  which was acquired from miro in august  sales of dv which commenced shipment in february  sales of reeltime which commenced shipment in march  and sales of mirovideo dc which commenced shipment in june sales outside of north america were approximately and of the company s net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in sales outside of north america in fiscal was primarily attributable to sales of mirovideo products in europe following the miro acquisition 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of costs related to the acquisition of components and subassemblies  labor and overhead associated with procurement  assembly and testing of finished products  warehousing  shipping and warranty costs 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage is due primarily to a significant charge to cost of sales in fiscal totaling million relating to inventory write downs 
engineering and product development 
engineering and product development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenditures in connection with the continued expansion of the company s engineering design teams  in particular the engineering design group based in braunschweig  germany established in connection with the miro acquisition

as of june   the company has federal research and experimentation and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million which expire between and  and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million which have no expiration provision 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date through sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of june  company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
the company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support the company s current operations and growth for the foreseeable future 
the company s operating activities used  in cash for the year ended june  cash was generated primarily from net income of million after adjustment for in process research and development charges  depreciation and amortization  and deferred taxes net of stock option benefits 
this was offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
these increases relate primarily to a increase in product revenues from fiscal to in addition  the company used cash to pay down notes and liabilities of over million assumed in its acquisition of truevision in march during the year ended june   cash flow from investing activities included million invested in property and equipment  compared to million in the year ended june  the high level of expenditures for the year ended june   was primarily for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment purchased for the company s mountain view facility expansions in september and january and june the company also incurred expenditures of approximately million in capitalized internal software related to its sap enterprise software implementation which began in january the company will continue to incur expenditures for the implementation through march cash flow from investing activities also increased due to the maturity of certain of the company s marketable securities 
as the company continues to grow  it expects ongoing purchases of property and equipment 
such capital expenditures will be financed from working capital 
on march   the company acquired all the outstanding common stock of truevision  a supplier of digital video products 
in connection with the acquisition  pinnacle issued  shares of common stock valued at million 
in addition  pinnacle issued to truevision employees and directors  options  valued at million  to purchase common stock at an exercise price of 
the company also assumed  warrants valued at million

under the terms of the agreement  pinnacle systems would acquire substantially all of the assets of hp s video communications division  including key technologies and intellectual property  the media stream family of products and selected assets  as well as most managers and employees 
on august   the company completed the purchase 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the company paid hp approximately million in cash and issued  shares of pinnacle s common stock valued at approximately million 
pursuant to a stock restriction and registration rights agreement set forth in the definitive agreement  pinnacle filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement on form s with respect to one half of the pinnacle shares issued to hp 
hp has agreed to certain restrictions with respect to the disposition of the remainder of such shares 
factors affecting operating results we have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly 
if we fail to effectively manage this growth  our financial results could suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth and anticipate that we will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the future 
for example  net sales in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal as a result of internal growth and recent acquisitions  we have increased the number of employees significantly over the last two fiscal years and many are geographically dispersed  primarily throughout north america and europe 
this growth places increasing demands on our management  financial and other resources 
we have built these resources and systems to account for such growth  but continued or accelerated growth may require us to increase our investment in such systems  or to reorganize our management team 
such changes  should they occur  could cause an interruption or diversion of focus from our core business activities and have an adverse effect on financial results 
any failure to successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired could negatively impact us 
in august  we closed the transaction with the hewlett packard company and in march  we completed the acquisitions of truevision  inc and shoreline studios  inc we may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
integrating acquired operations is a complex  time consuming and potentially expensive process 
all acquisitions involve risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
these risks include distracting management from the day to day operations of our business costs  delays and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations  products and personnel the potential to result in dilutive issuance of our equity securities incurring debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets there are various factors which may cause our net revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include timing of significant orders from and shipments to major oem customers timing and market acceptance of new products success in developing  introducing and shipping new products dependence on distribution channels through which our products are sold increased competition and pricing pressure accuracy of our and our resellers forecasts of end user demand accuracy of inventory forecasts ability to obtain sufficient supplies from our subcontractors timing and level of consumer product returns foreign currency fluctuations costs of integrating acquired operations general domestic and international economic conditions  such as the recent economic downturn in asia and latin america 
we also experience significant fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal fluctuations  the timing of major trade shows and the sale of consumer products in anticipation of the holiday season 
sales usually slow down during the summer months of july and august  especially in europe 
also  we attend a number of annual trade shows which can influence the order pattern of products  including cebit in march  the nab convention held in april  the ibc convention held in september and the comdex exhibition held in november 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income would be disproportionately affected by a shortfall in net sales 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our stock price may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and could in the future fluctuate significantly 
the fluctuations have been or could be in response to numerous factors including quarterly variations in results of operations announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors changes in securities analysts recommendations announcements of acquisitions earnings estimates for us general fluctuations in the stock market our revenues and results of operations may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors 
this could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for high technology companies have been particularly affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been brought against the issuing company 
although no such litigation has been brought against us  it is possible that similar litigation could be brought against us 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and would likely divert management s attention and resources 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers and single or limited source suppliers for our components 
if these manufacturers and suppliers do not meet our demand either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture our desktop and consumer products and the major subassemblies of our broadcast products 
we and our manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for a number of components and parts used in our products  including certain key integrated circuits 
our strategy to rely on subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process potential absence of adequate capacity potential delays in lead times unavailability of certain process technologies reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs unexpected increases in component costs if any significant subcontractor or single or limited source suppliers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these subassemblies or provide critical components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available and product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
this could materially harm our business 
any extended interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the products  subassemblies or components manufactured by third party subcontractors or suppliers could materially harm our business 
we may fail to sell products in the consumer market 
we entered the consumer market with the acquisition of the videodirector product line from gold disk in june we began shipping our first internally developed consumer product  the videodirector studio  in march and began shipping a successor product  the studio in june in addition  with the miro acquisition in august  we acquired miro s consumer products and european sales organization 
we aim to continue to invest resources to develop  market and sell products into the consumer market 
in this endeavor  we need to continue to develop and maintain the following capabilities marketing and selling products through the consumer distribution channels 
establish relationships with distributors and retailers a fully developed infrastructure to support electronic retail stores and telephone and internet orders 
additionally  factors beyond our control could hurt consumer product sales and consequently our financial condition 
these factors include potential compatibility problems with other manufacturers electronic components the risk of obsolete inventory and inventory returns the growth of the consumer video market is difficult to predict if our products do not keep pace with the technological developments in the rapidly changing video post production equipment industry  then we may be adversely affected 
the video post production equipment industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  our inability to timely develop and introduce such new products  the failure of such products to gain significant market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could materially harm our business  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we are critically dependent on the successful introduction  market acceptance  manufacture and sale of new products that offer our customers additional features and enhanced performance at competitive prices 
once a new product is developed  we must rapidly commence volume production 
this process requires accurate forecasting of customer requirements and attainment of acceptable manufacturing costs 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older  displaced products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
for example  the introduction of dvextreme  lightning and studio has resulted in a significant decline in sales of prizm  flashfile and studio and a write down of inventory 
in addition  as is typical with any new product introduction  quality and reliability problems may arise 
any such problems could result in reduced bookings  manufacturing rework costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable  additional service warranty costs and a limitation on market acceptance of the product 
if we do not effectively compete  our business will be harmed 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
we compete in the broadcast  desktop and consumer video production markets 
we anticipate increased competition in each of the broadcast  desktop and consumer video production markets  particularly since the industry is undergoing a period of technological change and consolidation 
competition for our broadcast  consumer and video products is generally based on product performance breadth of product line quality of service and support market presence price ability of competitors to develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products certain competitors in the broadcast  desktop and consumer video markets have larger financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we do 
in addition  some competitors have established relationships with current and potential customers of ours and offer a wide variety of video equipment that can be bundled in certain large system sales 
principal competitors in the broadcast market include chyron corporation leitch technology corporation matsushita electric industrial co 
ltd 
quantel ltd 
a division of carlton communications plc accom  inc sony corporation tektronix  inc seachange corporation principal competitors in the desktop and consumer markets are quantel ltd 
a division of carlton communications plc accom  inc sony corporation avid technology  inc digitel processing systems  inc fast multimedia iomega corp 
matrox electronics systems  ltd 
hauppauge digital  inc media  inc adobe systems  inc these lists are not all inclusive 
the consumer market in which certain of our products compete is an emerging market and the sources of competition are not yet well defined 
there are several established video companies that are currently offering products or solutions that compete directly or indirectly with our consumer products by providing some or all of the same features and video editing capabilities 
in addition  we expect that existing manufacturers and new market entrants will develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products that may compete directly with our consumer products 
we expect that potential competition in this market is likely to come from existing video editing companies  software application companies  or new entrants into the market  many of which have the financial resources  marketing and technical ability to develop products for the consumer video market 
increased competition in any of these markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
any of these effects could materially harm our business 
we rely heavily on dealers and oems to market  sell  and distribute our products 
in turn  we depend heavily on the success of these resellers 
if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  then our financial performance will be negatively affected 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products experience financial difficulties and even close operations our dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell our products 
therefore  they may  at any time refuse to promote or pay for our products discontinue our products in favor of a competitor s product also  with these distribution channels standing between them and the actual market  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand for products and anticipate demand for newly introduced products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores stocked with the newest products and not because there is a significant demand for them 
as to consumer products offerings  we have expanded our distribution network to include several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
we also sell our consumer products directly to certain retailers 
rapid change and financial difficulties of distributors have characterized distribution channels for consumer retail products 
these arrangements have exposed us to the following risks  some of which are out of our control we are obligated to provide price protection to such retailers and distributors and  while the agreements limit the conditions under which product can be returned to us  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations 
the distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our consumer products 
retailers and retail distributors often carry competing products 
any of the foregoing events could materially harm our business 
if certain of our key employees leave or are no longer able to perform services for us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of managerial personnel and technical employees to compete successfully 
we believe that the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key technical personnel are very important to our continued success 
only one has an employment agreement and none are the subject of key man life insurance 
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel 
there are not enough engineers  technical support  software services and managers available to meet the current demands of the computer industry 
we may not be able to retain our key technical and managerial employees or attract  assimilate and retain such other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as required in the future 
also  employees may leave our employ and subsequently compete against us  or contractors may perform services for competitors of ours 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary information and procedures effectively 
we must protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and oem customers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary technology 
these steps may not protect our proprietary information nor give us any competitive advantage 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business could be materially harmed 
we may be adversely affected if we are sued by a third party or if we decide to sue a third party for infringement 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us  or to defend us against claimed infringement 
this litigation may divert management s attention away from the operation of our business result in the loss of our proprietary rights subject us to significant liabilities force us to seek licenses from third parties prevent us from manufacturing or selling products 
any of these results could materially harm our business 
in the course of business  we have in the past received communications asserting that our products infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we investigated the factual basis of such communications and negotiated licenses where appropriate 
it is likely that in the course of our business  we will receive similar communications in the future 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our products  or relating to current or future technologies  we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
these disputes may not be settled on commercially reasonable terms and may result in long and costly litigation 
because we sell products internationally  we are subject to additional risks 
sales of our products outside of north america represented approximately of net sales in the year ended june   compared to and of net sales in the fiscal years that ended june  and respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales 
we make foreign currency denominated sales in many  primarily european  countries 
this exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
although the dollar amount of such foreign currency denominated sales was nominal during fiscal  it increased substantially during fiscal and  especially for sales of consumer and desktop products into europe 
in fiscal and beyond  we expect that a majority of our european sales will be denominated in local foreign currency including the euro 
the company has developed natural hedges for some of this risk in that most of the european selling expenses are also denominated in local currency 
in addition to foreign currency risks  international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks unexpected changes in regulatory requirements export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing international operations potential insolvency of international dealers and difficulty in collecting accounts we are also subject to the risks of generally poor economic conditions in certain areas of the world  most notably asia 
these risks may harm our future international sales and  consequently  our business 
computer software  components and systems used by or designed by us or used by third parties with whom we regularly deal may not be able to process date time information between the twentieth and twenty first century 
this inability could cause the disruption or failure of such computer systems 
our business could be interrupted materially as a result of such disruption or failure 
like many other companies  we are potentially susceptible to the year problem  ie  computer systems will not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year in addition  moving from to may cause problems since some systems programming assigns special meaning to certain dates  such as  and the year is a leap year 
we are conducting a program to confront these potential problems 
this program involves assessing all areas that may be affected by or responsible for a year problem and initiating changes wherever necessary 
some of the activities include assessing all major categories of systems used by us  including manufacturing  sales and financial systems working with key suppliers of products and services to determine that their operations and products are year capable  or to monitor their progress toward year capability discussing contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems and with suppliers and other third parties implementing a program to assess the capability of our products to handle the year it is expected that assessment  remediation and contingency planning activities will be ongoing throughout with the goal of appropriately resolving all material internal systems and third party issues 
further  we have contingency plans  but if these planning activities fail  our business could be materially harmed 
it is uncertain to what extent we will be affected by the year problem  and if third parties or suppliers have year problems  our business may be materially harmed 
to assist customers in evaluating their year issues  we have assessed the capability of our current and discontinued products 
products have been assigned to one of the four following categories year compliant  year compliant with minor issues year non compliant  and no evaluation done will not test 
year compliant means that when used properly and in conformity with the product information provided by us  and when used with year compliant computer systems  the product will accurately store  display  process  provide  and or receive data from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  including leap year calculations  provided that all other technology used in combination with our product properly exchanges date data with our product 
based on our tests  we believe that all current products shipping  which run under microsoft windows nt or windows  will be year compliant 
final results of our complete product testing will be published by fall the cost which will be incurred by us regarding the implementation of year compliant internal information systems  testing of current or older products for year compliance  and answering and responding to customer requests related to year issues  including both incremental spending and redeployed resources  is currently not expected to exceed  the total cost estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
in some instances  the installation schedule of new software and hardware in the normal course of business is being accelerated to also afford a solution to year capability issues 
the total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of the projects and is subject to change 
if actual cost of year compliance materially exceeds our current estimate  our business could be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currencies we transact business in various foreign currencies but primarily in those of germany  france and the uk accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency activity at any of our foreign locations 
instead  we believe that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenues substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we invest primarily in us treasury notes and high grade commerical paper and hold them to maturity 
consequently  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is two years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issue  as well as the type of instruments 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in these guidelines  our exposure to market and credit risk is low
