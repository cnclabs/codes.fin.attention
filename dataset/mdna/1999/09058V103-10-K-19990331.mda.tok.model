item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of the company 
such statements are only predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed in other filings made by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
overview since its inception in  the company has been engaged in research and development activities including drug discovery  manufacturing compounds  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and organizational efforts including recruiting its scientific and management personnel  establishing laboratory facilities  engaging its scientific advisory board and raising capital 
the company has not received any revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and does not expect to receive such revenues to a significant extent for at least several years  if at all 
the company has incurred operating losses since its inception 
the company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years and expects such losses to increase as the company s research  development and clinical trial efforts expand 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to the million in up front fees received from pri and ortho mcneil in for a license agreement for the company s influenza neuraminidase inhibitors compared to the million milestone payment received from torii in interest and other income decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a decline in the weighted average investment for research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in such expenses vary from period to period based on the status of the company s projects 
the company completed two phase iii clinical trials in in  the company commenced two phase i clinical trials for its serine protease inhibitor  continued its two phase i ii clinical trials for an oral formulation of its pnp inhibitor and initiated preclinical studies for its influenza neuraminidase and serine protease inhibitors 
overall  the decline in costs associated with the company s pnp inhibitor project were partially offset by the increases in the company s serine protease and influenza neuraminidase projects 
as a result  there was a slight decrease in in the outside research and development efforts associated with the company s three primary research and development projects 
the company reduced some of its other discretionary costs  which was offset by one time costs associated with signing a license agreement for the company s influenza neuraminidase inhibitors and certain related agreements in september general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the license agreement and related agreements for the company s influenza neuraminidase inhibitors signed in september interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to a decline in capitalized lease obligations resulting in lesser interest expense 
the company obtained most of its leases in connection with the move to its facilities in april year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a million milestone payment received from torii in compared to the million license fee received from torii and a factor d grant in interest and other income increased to  in from  in  primarily due to interest earned on funds invested from the company s public offering in september research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with manufacturing compounds  clinical trials and preclinical studies and expenses associated with increased personnel 
these costs tend to fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of development and the conduct of clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses increased 
to  in from  in the increase was in several categories  primarily increased personnel costs and the fact that expenses were reduced by the reversal of a liability recorded in for use taxes assessed that the company successfully contested in  and was partially offset by decreased fees and taxes on the torii milestone in versus the fees and taxes on the torii license in and decreased legal expenses in interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to a decline in capitalized lease obligations  along with long term debt  resulting in lesser interest expense 
the company obtained most of its leases in connection with the move to its facilities in april liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since the company s inception 
operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  facility leases  collaborative and other research and development agreements including licenses and options for licenses  research grants and interest income 
in addition  the company has attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment or facilities  contracting with third parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
the company expects to incur additional expenses  resulting in significant losses  as it continues and expands its research and development activities and undertakes additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds which have been or may be discovered 
the company also expects to incur substantial administrative  manufacturing and commercialization expenditures in the future as it seeks food and drug administration the fda approval for its compounds and establishes its manufacturing capability under good manufacturing practices  and substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   the company s cash  cash equivalents and securities held to maturity were  an increase of  from december  principally due to the million equity investment in the company in connection with the influenza neuraminidase license offsetting the cash used in operations 
the company has financed its equipment purchases primarily with lease lines of credit 
the company currently has a  line of credit with its bank to finance capital equipment 
in january  the company entered into an operating lease for its current facilities which  based on an extension signed in june  expires on june   with an option to lease for an additional three years at current market rates 
the operating lease requires the company to pay monthly rent ranging from  and escalating annually to a minimum of  per month in the final year  and a pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of base year amounts 
at december   the company had long term capital lease and operating lease obligations which provide for aggregate minimum payments of  in   in and  in pursuant to the license agreement for the company s influenza neuraminidase inhibitors  ortho mcneil and pri paid the company an initial million for reimbursement of research and development expenses and in license fees and jjdc  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  made a million equity investment in the company 
while the license agreement provides for potential milestone payments of up to an additional million and royalties on future sales of licensed products  there can be no assurance that pri will continue to develop the product or  that if it does so  that it will result in meeting the milestones or achieving future sales of licensed products 
the company also entered into an exclusive license agreement with torii under which torii paid the company million in initial license fees and made a million equity investment in the company in the first milestone payment of million was received in while the torii license agreement provides for potential milestone payments of up to an additional million and royalties on future sales of licensed products in japan  there can be no assurance that torii will continue to develop the product in japan or  that if it does so  that it will result in meeting the milestones or achieving future sales of licensed products in japan 
the company plans to finance its needs principally from its existing capital resources and interest thereon  from payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  through research grants  and to the extent available  through lease or loan financing and future public or private financings 
the company believes that its available funds will be sufficient to fund the company s operations at least through the end of however  this is a forward looking statement  and no assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
the company s long term capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend upon many factors  including results of research and development  results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  relationships with strategic partners  changes in the focus and direction of the company s research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  changes in existing collaborative  licensing  research or development relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative relationships and the fda regulatory process 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of existing stockholders of the company 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require the company to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of its research and development programs or to license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that the company would otherwise undertake itself 
risks associated with the year the year issue year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to represent the year and affects both information technology it and non it systems 
thus  computer software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among others  a temporary inability to process certain data or engage in similar normal business activities 
plan and status 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company has completed its assessment of its it systems 
in  the company installed a computer network  upgraded its macintosh computers to ibm compatible personal computers and upgraded its it software to a common standard 
as a consequence  most of its it systems are identified by the manufacturer as year compliant 
the company is completing its assessment of non it systems  most of which is equipment used in the laboratories 
major vendors and suppliers are also being contacted with regard to their year compliance and the company will continue to monitor their compliance 
the company anticipates completing its assessment by the end of the first quarter of systems identified as not being year compliant will be brought into compliance by upgrading either the software or hardware 
the company expects to begin remediation and testing by the second quarter of and to be fully implemented by the end of the third quarter of while the company has queried its significant suppliers  vendors and other outside parties and will continue to monitor their year compliance status  the company has no means of ensuring that suppliers  vendors and other outside parties will be year ready 
the inability of suppliers  vendors and other outside parties including the government to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by suppliers  vendors and outside parties is not determinable 
costs 
the costs incurred to date for year compliance have not been material less than  and are not expected to be material when completed less than 
the company anticipates that it will be able to fund its costs from current funds available for operations 
if  however  the costs are higher than anticipated  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks 
while management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner  as noted above  the company has not completed all necessary phases of the year program for compliance 
in the event that the company or third parties do not complete any additional phases  the company may not be able to complete the testing of its compounds and advancing its projects into human clinical trials in support of an nda filing 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely effect the company 
the company is unable to estimate if it has any potential liability or potential lost revenue at this time 
there can be no assurance that the company will not discover year compliance issues that will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingency 
the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories and adjusting staffing strategies 
there can be no assurance that these contingency plans will be adequate 
certain factors that may affect future results  financial condition and the market price of securities early stage of development  uncertainty of product development  technological uncertainty biocryst is at an early stage of development 
all of the company s compounds are in research and development  and no revenues have been generated from sales of its compounds 
it will be a number of years  if ever  before the company will recognize significant revenues from product sales or royalties 
to date  most of the company s resources have been dedicated to the research and development of pharmaceutical compounds based upon its purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnp program for the treatment of t cell proliferative diseases and disorders and for the development of inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase and enzymes and proteins involved in the complement cascade 
the company and pri have conducted preclinical studies with its influenza neuraminidase inhibitor and the company is conducting clinical studies with its lead drugs  bcx and bcx  and results from these studies may not support future human clinical testing or further development of the compounds 
phase iii trials completed in with a cream formulation of bcx for treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma ctcl and psoriasis and a phase i ii trial completed in for a topical ointment treatment for psoriasis did not show statistical efficacy 
accordingly  the company has discontinued further development of these topical formulations of bcx  but is continuing its oral trials for bcx t cell proliferative diseases  as well as the other disease indications the company is studying  are highly complex and their causes are not fully known 
the company s compounds under development will require significant additional  time consuming and costly research and development  preclinical testing and extensive clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
product development of new pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain  and unanticipated developments  clinical or regulatory delays  unexpected adverse side effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy could slow or prevent product development efforts and have a material adverse effect on the company 
one of biocryst s lead drugs  bcx  reversibly inhibits t cell activity  an essential component of the human immune system 
in addition to any direct toxicities or side effects the drug may cause  bcx  while inhibiting t cells  may compromise the immune system s ability to fight infection 
although the company will monitor immunosuppression during drug dosing  there can be no assurance that the drug will not cause irreversible immunosuppression 
there can be no assurance that the company s research or product development efforts as to any particular compound will be successfully completed  that the compounds currently under development will be safe or efficacious  that required regulatory approvals can be obtained  that products can be manufactured at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality or that any approved products can be successfully marketed or will be accepted by patients  health care providers and third party payors 
few drugs discovered by use of structure based drug design have been successfully developed  approved by the fda or marketed 
within the pharmaceutical industry  treatment of the disease indications being pursued by the company  especially t cell proliferative diseases such as ctcl and psoriasis  have proven difficult 
there can be no assurance that drugs resulting from the approach of structure based drug design employed by the company will overcome the difficulties of drug discovery and development or result in commercially successful products 
uncertainty associated with preclinical and clinical testing before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of its products  biocryst must undertake extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans 
the company has limited experience in conducting clinical trials 
to date  the company has conducted initial preclinical testing of certain of its compounds and is testing an oral formulation of bcx and an intravenous formulation of bcx in various clinical trials 
the results of initial preclinical and clinical testing of compounds under development by the company are neither necessarily predictive of results that will be obtained from subsequent or more extensive preclinical and clinical testing nor necessarily acceptable to the fda to support applications for marketing permits 
however  the company completed in two phase iii trials of a topical cream formulation and in a phase i ii trial of a topical ointment formulation of bcx which did not show statistical efficacy 
even if the results of subsequent clinical tests are positive  products  if any  resulting from the company s research and development programs are not likely to be commercially available for several years 
additionally  the company has made and may in the future make changes to the formulation of its drugs and or to the processes for manufacturing its drugs 
any such future changes in formulation or manufacturing processes could result in delays in conducting further preclinical and clinical testing  in unexpected adverse events in further preclinical and clinical testing  and or in additional development expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that clinical studies of products under development will be acceptable to the fda or demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such products at all or to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals of such products 
companies in the industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to comply with good clinical practices requirements for data integrity or to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product  and would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and the existence of competitive clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment in the company s current trials or future clinical trials may result in increased costs and or program delays which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on collaborative partners  relationship with the university of alabama at birmingham uab the company s strategy for research  development and commercialization of certain of its products is to rely in part upon various arrangements with corporate partners  licensees and others 
as a result  the company s products are dependent in large part upon the subsequent success of such third parties in performing preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
the company entered into an exclusive license agreement with ortho mcneil and pri in september to develop  manufacture and commercialize its influenza neuraminidase inhibitor compounds for the flu 
the company also entered into an exclusive license agreement with torii in may to develop  manufacture and commercialize in japan bcx and certain other pnp inhibitor compounds for three indications 
the company has also entered into collaborative arrangements with dimensional pharmaceuticals  inc to share resources and technology to expedite the identification of inhibitors of key serine protease enzymes and with novartis to pursue development of certain types of pnp inhibitors 
the company intends to pursue additional collaborations in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate additional acceptable collaborative arrangements or that such arrangements will be successful 
no assurance can be given that the company s collaborative partners  particularly ortho mcneil and pri  will be able to obtain fda approval for any licensed compounds  that any such licensed compounds  if so approved  will be able to be commercialized successfully  or that the company will realize any revenues pursuant to such arrangements  including any milestone or royalty payments under the license agreement 
although the company believes that parties to collaborative arrangements generally have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources which they devote to these activities are not within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that such parties will perform their obligations as expected or that current or potential collaborators will not pursue treatments for other diseases or seek alternative means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by collaborative programs with the company or that any additional revenues will be derived from such arrangements 
if any of the company s collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with the company or otherwise fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the development or commercialization of the product candidate or research program under such collaboration agreement may be delayed  the company may be required to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or to devote unforeseen additional resources to such development or commercialization  or such development or commercialization could be terminated 
the termination or cancellation of collaborative arrangements  particularly by ortho mcneil and pri  could also adversely affect the company s financial condition  intellectual property position and operations 
in addition  disagreements between collaborators and the company have in the past and could in the future lead to delays in the collaborative research  development or commercialization of certain product candidates  or could require or result in legal process or arbitration for resolution 
these consequences could be time consuming  expensive and could have material adverse effects on the company 
the successful commercialization of the company s compounds and product candidates is also dependent upon the company s ability to develop collaborative arrangements with academic institutions and consultants to support research and development efforts and to conduct clinical trials 
the company s primary academic collaboration has been with uab to support its ongoing research and development programs 
in  the company completed its funding obligations with uab for the development of inhibitors for influenza neuraminidase and factor d 
uab  however  will continue to share in any revenues derived from those two projects and the company intends to continue using certain uab faculty members as consultants to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s current arrangements with uab will continue or that the company will be able to develop successful collaborative arrangements with academic institutions and consultants in the future 
government regulation  no assurance of product approval the research  testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution  advertising  marketing and sale of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
prior to marketing  compounds developed by the company must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process required by the fda and by comparable agencies in other countries 
this process  which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each compound to establish its safety and effectiveness and confirmation by the fda that good laboratory  clinical and manufacturing practices were maintained during testing and manufacturing  can take many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources and gives larger companies with greater financial resources a competitive advantage over the company 
to date  no compound or drug candidate being evaluated by the company has been submitted for approval to the fda or any other regulatory authority for marketing  and there can be no assurance that any such compound or drug candidate will ever be approved for marketing or that the company will be able to obtain the labeling claims desired for its compounds or drug candidates 
the company is and will continue to be dependent upon the laboratories and medical institutions conducting its preclinical studies and clinical trials to maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices and  except for the formulating and packaging of small quantities of its drug formulations which the company is currently undertaking  upon the manufacturers of its compounds to maintain compliance with current gmp requirements 
data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent fda regulatory approval 
delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in fda policy for drug approval during the period of development and fda regulatory review 
similar delays also may be encountered in foreign countries 
moreover  even if approval is granted  such approval may entail commercially unacceptable limitations on the labeling claims for which a compound may be marketed 
even if such regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed drug or compound and its manufacturer are subject to continual review and inspection  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product or manufacturer may result in restrictions or sanctions on such product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market  and other enforcement actions 
in june the company notified the fda that it had submitted incorrect efficacy data to the fda pertaining to its phase ii dose ranging studies of bcx for ctcl and psoriasis 
the fda inspected the company in november in relation to a study involving the topical application of bcx concluded in early  and in june the fda inspected the company and one of its clinical sites in relation to a phase ii dose ranging study of bcx for ctcl and a phase ii dose ranging study for psoriasis  both of which were concluded in early after each inspection  the fda issued to the company a list of inspectional observations form fda setting forth certain deficient good clinical practices procedures followed by the company  some of which resulted in submission to the fda of efficacy data which reported false statistical significance 
the fda also issued a form fda to the principal investigator at one of the company s clinical sites citing numerous significant deficiencies in the conduct of the phase ii dose ranging studies of bcx for ctcl and psoriasis 
these deficiencies included improper delegations of authority by the principal investigator  failures to follow the protocols  institutional review board deviations  and discrepancies or deficiencies in documentation and reporting 
the company received notice from the fda in november that work in support of products under fda jurisdiction performed by this investigator would not be accepted by the fda without validating information 
currently  the company does not intend to pursue a topical treatment for bcx  which is the clinical study this investigator pursued for the company 
as a consequence of the fda inspections and such resulting form fda s  the company s ongoing and future clinical studies may receive increased scrutiny  this may delay the regulatory review process or require the company to increase the number of patients at other sites to obtain approval which can not be assured on a timely basis or at all 
the company has adjusted certain of its procedures  but there can be no assurance that the fda will find such adjustments to be in compliance with fda requirements or that  even if it does find such adjustments to be in compliance  it will not seek to impose administrative  civil or other sanctions in connection with the earlier studies 
such sanctions or other government regulation may delay or prevent the marketing of products being developed by the company  impose costly procedures upon the company s activities and confer a competitive advantage to larger companies or companies that are more experienced in regulatory affairs and that compete with the company 
there can be no assurance that fda or other regulatory approval for any products developed by the company will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
delay in obtaining or failure to obtain such regulatory approvals will materially adversely affect the marketing of any products which may be developed by the company  as well as the company s results of operations 
history of operating losses  accumulated deficit  uncertainty of future profitability biocryst  to date  has generated no revenue from product sales and has incurred losses since its inception 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research activities aimed at discovering  designing and developing the company s pharmaceutical product candidates and from general and administrative costs 
these costs have exceeded the company s revenues  which to date have been generated primarily from collaborative arrangements  licenses  research grants and from interest income 
the company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years and expects such losses to increase as the company s research and development and clinical trial efforts continue 
the company s ability to achieve profitability depends in part upon its ability to develop drugs and to obtain regulatory approval for its products that may be developed  to enter into agreements with collaborative partners for product development  manufacturing and commercialization  and to develop the capacity to manufacture  market and sell its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
additional financing requirements  uncertainty of additional funding the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations in each year since its inception 
the company expects that the funding requirements for its operating activities will increase substantially in the future due to continued research and development activities including preclinical studies and clinical trials  the development of manufacturing capabilities and the development of marketing and distribution capabilities 
the company anticipates that its capital resources are adequate to satisfy its capital requirements for approximately the next months at the current level of operations 
however  this is a forward looking statement  and no assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its research  drug discovery and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in existing collaborative research or development relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative relationships  and the cost of manufacturing scale up and effective marketing activities and arrangements 
the company anticipates  based on its current business plan  that it will be necessary to raise additional funds in or earlier 
additional funds  if any  may possibly be raised through financing arrangements or collaborative relationships and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of existing stockholders of the company 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require the company to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
if adequate funds are not available  the company will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its research  drug discovery or development programs or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish some or all of its rights to certain of its intellectual property  product candidates or products 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  if at all 
competition the company is engaged in the pharmaceutical industry  which is characterized by extensive research efforts  rapid technological progress and intense competition 
there are many public and private companies  including well known pharmaceutical companies  chemical companies  specialized biotechnology companies and academic institutions  engaged in developing synthetic pharmaceuticals and biotechnological products for human therapeutic applications that represent significant competition to the company 
existing products and therapies and improvements thereto will compete directly with products the company is seeking to develop and market  and the company is aware that other companies or institutions are pursuing development of new drugs and technologies directly targeted at applications for which the company is developing its drug compounds 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities and experience than does the company 
the company has granted novartis corporation  formerly ciba geigy corporation  novartis  a worldwide exclusive license to several compounds in the company s sixth group of pnp inhibitors 
such arrangement with novartis does not include bcx or most of the company s other compounds 
no assurance can be given that novartis will or will not develop compounds under such arrangements  will be able to obtain fda approval for any licensed compounds  that any such licensed compounds if so approved will be able to be commercialized successfully  or that the company will realize any revenues pursuant to such arrangements 
if commercialized  these compounds could compete directly against other compounds  including bcx  being developed by the company 
many of the company s competitors have significantly greater experience in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of new pharmaceutical compounds and in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals for health care products 
accordingly  biocryst s competitors may succeed in obtaining approvals for their drug candidates more rapidly than the company and in developing products that are safer or more effective or less costly than any that may be developed by the company and may also be more successful than the company in the production and marketing of such products 
many of the company s competitors also have current gmp facilities and significantly greater experience in implementing gmp or in obtaining and maintaining the requisite regulatory standards for manufacturing 
moreover  other technologies are  or may in the future become  the basis for competitive products 
competition may increase further as a result of the potential advances from structure based drug design and greater availability of capital for investment in this field 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive 
uncertainty of protection of patents and proprietary rights the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for its products  preserve its trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties  both in the united states and in other countries 
in the absence of patent protection  the company s business may be adversely affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technology 
because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace  the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
to date  the company has been issued seven united states patents related to its pnp inhibitor compounds 
one of these compounds is under a patent issued to warner lambert and the company may require a license from warner lambert to market a product containing this compound 
the company has the right of first refusal to negotiate a license from warner lambert for that compound  however  there can be no assurance that such a license would be available or obtainable on terms acceptable to the company 
a patent has also been issued to biocryst by the us patent and trademark office pto on a new process to prepare bcx and other pnp inhibitors and an additional patent application has been filed for another new process to prepare bcx and other pnp inhibitors 
in addition  two patent applications and two provisional patents have been filed with the pto relating to inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase 
also  two provisional united states patent applications have been filed with the pto on complement inhibitors 
the company has filed certain corresponding foreign patent applications and intends to file additional foreign patent applications and additional united states patent applications  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from such applications  that the company will develop additional products that are patentable or that present or future patents will provide sufficient protection to the company s present or future technologies  products and processes 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information  design around the company s patents or obtain access to the company s know how or that others will not successfully challenge the validity of the company s patents or be issued patents which may prevent the sale of one or more of the company s product candidates  or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by the company to third parties in order to enable the company to conduct its business 
legal standards relating to the scope of claims and the validity of patents in the fields in which the company is pursuing research and development are still evolving  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
no assurance can be given as to the degree of protection or competitive advantage any patents issued to the company will afford  the validity of any such patents or the company s ability to avoid violating or infringing any patents issued to others 
further  there can be no guarantee that any patents issued to or licensed by the company will not be infringed by the products of others 
litigation and other proceedings involving the defense and prosecution of patent claims can be expensive and time consuming  even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to the company  and can result in the diversion of resources from the company s other activities 
an adverse outcome could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the company to obtain licenses from third parties or require the company to cease any related research and development activities or sales 
the company s success is also dependent upon the skills  knowledge and experience none of which is patentable of its scientific and technical personnel 
to help protect its rights  the company requires all employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the company and requires disclosure and assignment to the company of their ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide adequate protection for the company s trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information 
the company s management and scientific personnel have been recruited primarily from other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions 
in many cases  these individuals are continuing research in the same areas with which they were involved prior to joining biocryst and may be restricted by agreement from disclosing to the company trade secrets they learned elsewhere 
as a result  the company could be subject to allegations of violation of such agreements and similar claims and litigation regarding such claims could ensue 
dependence on key management and qualified personnel the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of its senior management and scientific team 
the loss of the services of one or more members of the senior management and scientific team could significantly impede the achievement of development objectives 
although the company maintains  and is the beneficiary of  a million key man insurance policy on the life of charles e 
bugg  phd  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  the company does not believe the proceeds would be adequate to compensate for his loss 
due to the specialized scientific nature of the company s business  the company is also highly dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and key management personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its existing business and its expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as production and marketing 
the loss of  or failure to recruit  scientific  technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company relies on members of its scientific advisory board and consultants to assist the company in formulating its research and development strategy 
all of the members of the scientific advisory board and all of the company s consultants are employed by other employers  and each such member or consultant may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to the company 
lack of manufacturing  marketing or sales capability the company has not yet manufactured or marketed any products and currently does not have the facilities to manufacture its product candidates in commercial quantities under gmp as prescribed and required by the fda 
to be successful  the company s products must be manufactured in commercial quantities under gmp and at acceptable costs 
although the company is formulating and packaging under gmp conditions small amounts of certain drug formulations which are the subject of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the current facilities of the company are not adequate for commercial scale production 
therefore  the company will need to develop its own gmp manufacturing facility and or depend on its collaborators  licensees or contract manufacturers for the commercial manufacture of its products 
the company has no experience in such commercial manufacturing and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to make the transition to commercial production successfully or at an acceptable cost 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to make arrangements with third parties to manufacture its products on acceptable terms  if at all 
the inability of the company to manufacture or provide for the manufacture of any products it may develop on a cost effective basis would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has no experience in marketing  distributing or selling pharmaceutical products and will have to develop a pharmaceutical sales force and or rely on its collaborators  licensees or arrangements with others to provide for the marketing  distribution and sales of any products it may develop 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish marketing  distribution and sales capabilities or make arrangements with collaborators  licensees or others to perform such activities 
uncertainty of third party reimbursement and product pricing successful commercialization of any pharmaceutical products the company may develop will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement or funding from third party health care payors such as government and private insurance plans 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement or funding will be available for newly approved pharmaceutical products or will permit price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on the company s investment in its pharmaceutical product development 
the us congress is considering a number of legislative and regulatory reforms that may affect companies engaged in the health care industry in the united states 
although the company cannot predict whether these proposals will be adopted or the effects such proposals may have on its business  the existence and pendency of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company in general 
in addition  the company s ability to commercialize potential pharmaceutical products may be adversely affected to the extent that such proposals have a material adverse effect on other companies that are prospective collaborators with respect to any of the company s pharmaceutical product candidates 
third party payors are continuing their efforts to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  which can control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may result in lower prices for pharmaceutical products 
the cost containment measures that health care providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products if successfully developed and approved 
risk of product liability  availability of insurance the company s business may be affected by potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical and other products under development by the company 
there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be asserted against the company  its collaborators or licensees 
the use of compounds or drug candidates developed by the company in clinical trials and the subsequent sale of such products is likely to cause biocryst to bear all or a portion of those risks 
the company does not have product liability insurance but does maintain coverage for clinical trials in the amount of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover claims made with respect to the clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any collaborators or licensees of biocryst will agree to indemnify the company  be sufficiently insured or have a net worth sufficient to satisfy any such product liability claims 
hazardous materials  compliance with environmental regulations the company s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company 
the company may incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations if the company develops manufacturing capacity 
control by existing management and stockholders  effect of certain anti takeover considerations the company s directors  executive officers and certain principal stockholders and their affiliates own beneficially approximately of the common stock 
accordingly  such holders  if acting together  may have the ability to exert significant influence over the election of the company s board of directors and other matters submitted to the company s stockholders for approval 
the voting power of these holders may discourage or prevent any proposed takeover of the company unless the terms thereof are approved by such holders 
pursuant to the company s composite certificate of incorporation the certificate of incorporation  shares of preferred stock may be issued by the company in the future without stockholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company and preventing stockholders from realizing a premium on their shares 
the company s certificate of incorporation also provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors 
a staggered board of directors and certain provisions of the company s by laws and of delaware law applicable to the company could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company 
price volatility the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded emerging pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or collaboration partners  achieving or failing to achieve development milestones  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by the company or its competitors  regulatory developments in both us and foreign countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products and economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations in the company s financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock
