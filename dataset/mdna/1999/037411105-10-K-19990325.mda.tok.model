item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in anticipation of lower commodity prices  apache entered with a primary objective being to strengthen its balance sheet in order to take advantage of lower cost drilling and acquisition opportunities that accompany cyclical downturns in product prices 
to accomplish this  high cost properties were sold  drilling capital was curtailed  subordinated debentures were converted into common equity  and non convertible preferred stock and public debt were issued 
as a result of these efforts during  apache reduced debt by million  from percent to percent of capitalization  the ratio would have been reduced to percent absent the non cash  full cost ceiling write down 
debt maturities were also lengthened to an average of years with approximately three percent of apache s total debt due over the next three years 
as a result  apache is in its strongest financial position ever to take advantage of opportunities brought about by the current industry downturn 
apache s results of operations and financial position for were also significantly impacted by the following factors additional depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense low oil and gas prices resulted in a non cash full cost ceiling write down of million after tax million pre tax 
there were no such charges in and commodity prices apache s average realized oil price decreased per barrel from per barrel in to per barrel in  reducing revenues by million 
the average realized price for natural gas decreased 
per mcf from per mcf in to per mcf in  negatively impacting revenues by million 
results of operations apache reported a loss attributable to common stock of million as opposed to income attributable to common stock of million 
the loss resulted from a full cost ceiling write down at year end 
results for were further hampered by sharp declines in oil and gas prices 
basic net income loss per common share was for  as compared to in income attributable to common stock increased million in from million in basic net income per common share increased percent in from in diluted net income per common share was for  percent above the increase from to was primarily due to higher oil and gas production  higher natural gas prices and lower operating costs per unit of production 
revenues declined million in  driven by a percent decrease in oil and gas production revenues 
the decrease in oil and gas production revenues resulted from a percent decrease in the average realized oil price  a percent decrease in the average realized price for natural gas and a three percent decrease in gas production 
crude oil  including natural gas liquids  contributed percent and natural gas contributed percent of oil and gas production revenues during revenues increased percent in to billion from million in in  crude oil and natural gas liquids contributed percent and natural gas contributed percent of oil and gas production revenues

the company periodically engages in hedging activities  including fixed price physical contracts and financial contracts 
apache realized gains from open hedging positions favorably impacting the gas price by 
per mcf in gains under long term fixed price physical contracts increased the gas price by 
per mcf in prices declined in the united states due to unfavorable market conditions 
natural gas prices in australia declined percent from resulting from the devaluation of the australian dollar 
natural gas production for the united states decreased percent from to due to the impact of property sales in the gulf and midcontinent regions  tropical storms in the gulf of mexico and natural depletion 
in australia  natural gas production increased percent driven by a full year of incremental production from properties acquired in the year end ampolex group transaction 
the percent uplift in canadian production resulted from development activity and alberta royalty recoupments received for alberta allows reduction in royalty for costs to build processing and transportation facilities 
natural gas revenues increased percent from to average natural gas prices were

per mcf in natural gas production increased nine percent from to from acquisitions and drilling activity 
the company s crude oil sales totaled million in  a percent decrease from due to lower average realized oil prices  which were partially offset by production increases 
on a worldwide basis  average oil prices decreased percent to per barrel negatively impacting oil sales by million 
oil production increased  barrels per day approximately percent  in due to increases in egypt and australia 
australian oil production increased  barrels per day over with additional production from the ampolex group transaction and initial sales from the stag field 
egyptian oil production increased  barrels per day  or percent  as a result of the price driven dynamics of certain production sharing contracts and to a lesser extent  drilling and development activity 
us oil production decreased by  barrels per day  or percent  primarily due to marginal property sales in the first half of and natural reservoir depletion of mature fields 
oil revenues increased percent from to egyptian oil production more than doubled in due to development activity and the first full year of production from the company s egyptian properties acquired in australian oil production increased percent from to primarily due to first production at the agincourt field 
these production increases were partially offset by an eight percent decrease in average oil prices received during natural gas liquid revenues decreased percent from natural gas liquid production increased barrels per day  or percent  while natural gas liquid prices declined by per barrel  or percent due to deteriorating market conditions 
natural gas liquid revenues were slightly higher in than in natural gas liquid production increased percent from to  which was offset by a percent decrease in average prices 
other revenues and operating expenses gas gathering  processing and marketing revenues decreased percent to million in from lower gas prices in contributed to the decrease 
gas gathering  processing and marketing costs decreased by percent to million resulting in a slight increase to margins 
during  gas gathering  processing and marketing revenues increased percent to million 
lower margins were realized in as compared to equity in loss of affiliates represents apache s share of proenergy losses 
equity in loss of affiliates was million  million and

apache limits  on a country by country basis  the capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and deferred income taxes  to estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent  net of related tax effects  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized 
as a result of low oil and gas prices at december   apache s capitalized costs of us oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation and the company reported a million pre tax million net of tax non cash write down 
no additional dd a was recorded during or if oil and gas prices deteriorate from the company s year end realized prices  it is likely that additional write downs will occur in write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities 
apache s operating costs decreased nine percent in to million from million in lease operating expense loe  excluding severance taxes  decreased from million in to million in on an equivalent barrel basis  loe for averaged per boe  a 
decline from per boe in domestic per unit costs were significantly reduced by the sale of marginal north american properties  and by lower western and gulf region repairs and maintenance costs 
operating costs increased three percent to million in from million in loe  excluding severance taxes  increased from million in to million in loe increased as a result of egyptian oil production enhancements and north american gas production gains

decline from per boe in administrative  selling and other costs g a increased million  or seven percent from to on an equivalent barrel basis  g a expense increased to

per boe in the increase in g a expense was primarily the result of employee separation payments associated with the sale of marginal north american properties 
g a expense increased million  or six percent  from to a new bonus plan initiated in  under which apache provided incentive compensation to all employees based on the achievement of targeted performance  was the primary reason for the increase 
on an equivalent barrel basis  g a expense declined from 
per boe in to 
per boe in production increases were not met with rising administrative costs 
net financing costs for decreased million  or two percent  from primarily due to higher capitalized interest 
gross interest expense increased million due to a slightly higher interest rate on average outstanding debt in compared to and higher imputed interest on advances from gas purchasers 
this was offset by an increase in capitalized interest  interest income and lower amortization of deferred loan costs 
the company s weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was approximately percent at december  compared to percent at december  the capitalized interest increase is associated with egyptian pipeline projects under construction 
the increase in interest income was due to a higher average cash balance during net financing costs for increased million  or percent  over gross interest expense increased by million due to higher average aggregate debt outstanding at higher average interest rates  which resulted from the extension of apache s debt maturities 
in  apache wrote off million in deferred loan costs related to the company s election to cancel two secured credit facilities with the international finance corporation ifc 
additional capitalized interest of million in mitigated these increases 
capitalized interest associated with higher international unevaluated costs caused the increase in market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its united states and canadian natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
in  apache recognized a net gain of million from hedging activities that increased oil and gas production revenues 
the net gain in includes million in derivative income and million in gains from fixed price physical gas contracts 
gains or losses on natural gas derivative contracts are expected to be offset by sales at the spot market price or to preserve the margin on existing physical contracts 
a percent improvement in year end spot market prices would increase the fair value of derivative contracts in effect at december  by million  while a percent drop in spot prices would decrease the fair value of these instruments by million 
interest rate risk the company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on over three fourths of the company s debt 
total debt at december   included about million of floating rate debt 
as a result  apache s annual interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately percent of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on annual cash flow of a percent change in the floating rate approximately basis points would be million 
foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
australian gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in australian dollars 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date 
reported cash flow relating to canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates for the period reported 
substantially all of the company s international transactions  outside of canada and australia  are denominated in us dollars 
the company s canadian and australian subsidiaries have net financial obligations that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries 
a decrease in value of percent in the australian and canadian dollars relative to the us dollar from the year end exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately 
million  based on december  amounts 
the company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december  cash flow  liquidity and capital resources capital commitments apache s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  payment of dividends  and capital obligations for affiliated ventures 
the company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows 
apache budgets capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows 
the company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow 
the company cannot accurately predict future product prices 
capital expenditures apache s oil and gas capital expenditures over the last three years are summarized below in thousands exploration and development united states    canada    egypt    australia    ivory coast    other international    total    acquisitions of oil and gas properties    expenditures for exploration and development totaled million in compared to million in apache s drilling program in added mmboe of proved reserves including revisions and replaced percent of production

estimated us exploration and development expenditures for are million  which includes million in the gulf region  million in the midcontinent region and million in the western region 
apache expects to spend million in canada in the company expects its other international exploration and development expenditures in  exclusive of facilities  to total approximately million 
capital expenditures will be reviewed and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions 
on november   the company entered into agreements to acquire certain oil and gas interests and companies holding oil and gas interests in the carnarvon basin  western australia  from subsidiaries of novus for approximately million 
the interests have proved reserves of approximately mmboe and daily production of  barrels of oil equivalent 
they are within the apache operated harriet joint venture which includes production  processing and pipeline infrastructure associated with the varanus island hub  the airlie joint venture in which the company held a prior interest and became operator and three other exploration permit areas 
the transaction closed in two stages  on december  for approximately million and on january  for approximately million 
under the terms of an agreement with novus  the company may be required to make additional payments to novus based on proved and probable recoverable oil and condensate reserves  as determined by independent engineers  on a defined geological structure in the gipsy rose lee area  offshore western australia 
if required  such payments would be calculated using for each barrel of proved and for each barrel of probable oil and condensate reserves 
a payment becomes due if and when a decision is made to construct facilities for the production of oil or condensate from the designated area 
in  the company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling million 
these acquisitions added approximately mmboe to the company s reserves 
on november   the company acquired  in the ampolex group transaction  all the capital stock of three companies owning interests in certain oil and gas properties including mmboe of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production facilities offshore western australia for approximately million pursuant to three agreements with subsidiaries of mobil 
funds for the ampolex group transaction were obtained principally from borrowings under the company s global credit facility 
the ampolex group transaction acquisition  net of the sale of certain properties to hardy  increased the company s interest to percent from percent in the carnarvon basin s harriet area  which included the varanus island pipeline  processing and production complex and eight existing oil and gas fields 
in addition  the company s interest in the east spar field  which produces through the varanus island facilities  increased to percent from percent 
apache operates both the harriet and east spar properties 
in conjunction with the closing of the ampolex group transaction on december   the company entered into an agreement under which hardy agreed to purchase a percent interest in the company s east spar gas field and related production facilities in western australia

apache acquired oil and gas properties totaling million from phoenix 
apache also acquired million of other oil and gas properties located primarily in the company s existing focus areas 
this amount included the purchase of certain oil and gas properties from hall houston oil company for million in cash 
funds for the acquisitions were obtained principally from borrowings under the company s revolving bank credit facility 
debt and interest commitments at december   apache had outstanding debt of million under its global credit facility and an aggregate of billion of other debt

scheduled principal payments for total million 
dividend payments apache paid million in dividends during on its series b preferred stock issued in august common dividends paid during totaled million  up percent from  due to the increased number of common shares outstanding 
the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive quarters through december   and expects to continue payment of dividends at current levels 
future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
capital resources and liquidity the company s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets 
net cash provided by operating activities apache s net cash provided by operating activities during totaled million  a decrease of percent from the million provided in this decrease was due primarily to lower oil and gas prices and lower gas production in  offset by the receipt of million from a purchaser as an advance 
the advance was for future natural gas deliveries over a ten year period commencing august net cash provided by operating activities in rose million from primarily due to higher product prices 
the receipt of million from a purchaser as an advance also impacted net cash provided by operating activities 
this advance was for future natural gas deliveries of  mmbtu per day over a ten year period commencing september long term borrowings in february  apache issued million principal amount  million net of discount  of senior unsecured percent notes maturing on february  the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity

these assets were reported as assets held for resale at december  the proceeds were used to reduce debt 
liquidity the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   up from million at december  apache s ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from at december   to 
at december  management believes that cash on hand  net cash generated from operations and unused committed borrowing capacity under its global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the company s financial obligations to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next two fiscal years 
as of december   apache s available borrowing capacity under its global credit facility was million 
impact of the year issue the inability of some computer programs and embedded computer chips to distinguish between the year and the year the year issue poses a serious threat of business disruption to any organization that utilizes computer technology and computer chip technology in their business systems or equipment 
apache has formed a year task force with representation from major business units to inventory and assess the risk associated with hardware  software  telecommunications systems  office equipment  embedded chip controls and systems  process control systems  facility control systems and dependencies on external trading partners 
the project phases  expected completion dates and percentage complete as of march are as follows percent phase completion date complete organization july assessment november desktop computers network hardware software embedded systems external trading partners building infrastructure systems telecommunications systems implementation replacement september computer hardware core business software desktop software embedded systems building systems contact external trading partners march contingency planning april to date  the company is not aware of any significant year issues that would cause problems in the area of safety  environmental or business interruption 
the company will assess the risks associated with hardware  software  infrastructure  embedded chips and external trading partners that are not year compliant 
while apache is confident that year remediation efforts will succeed in minimizing exposure to business disruption  plans are being developed that will allow continuation of business in all but the worst case scenarios 
all remediation and replacement efforts and contingency planning are expected to be complete by september all critical external trading partners have been contacted to determine year readiness and contingency plans will be developed where assurance of year compliance is not received by march  in  the company initiated a project to replace existing business software as it relates to apache s production  land  marketing  accounting and financial systems to more effectively and efficiently meet its business needs 
replacement computer systems selected by the company from sap america  inc  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  innovative business solutions and landmark graphics will properly recognize dates beyond december  the company plans to implement the replacement software by march  the business system replacement project is percent complete and the company believes that the march  deadline is attainable 
the company expects the cost to achieve year compliance will not exceed million excluding the cost of implementing business replacement systems 
the company presently believes that with conversions to new software and completion of efforts planned by the year task force  the risk associated with year will be significantly reduced 
however  the company is unable to assure that the consequences of year failures of systems maintained by the company or by third parties will not materially adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
future trends apache s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings by continuing to explore on and develop its inventory of existing projects and making carefully targeted acquisitions of new assets 
crude oil prices have fallen to the lowest level in over a decade 
drilling costs and acquisition prices have also declined 
as one of few companies to have reduced debt in  apache is well positioned to execute the second phase of its long term strategy  which is to complete a meaningful acquisition in that builds shareholder value 
accordingly  apache s plans include controlling g a and loe expense  curtailing drilling costs  and pursuing opportunities to acquire properties 
although no specific opportunity has as yet been identified as likely  the company believes that the number of quality acquisition  merger and joint venture opportunities has increased dramatically 
apache s international properties should continue to grow in importance with respect to apache s financial results and future growth prospects 
apache s international efforts remain focused on development of its discoveries in egypt  offshore western australia  china and the ivory coast  and exploration efforts on the company s concessions in egypt and in poland 
while international exploration is recognized as higher risk than apache s north american activities  the company believes it offers potential for greater rewards and significant reserve additions 
apache also believes that reserve additions in these international areas may be made through higher risk exploration and through improved production practices and recovery techniques 
under the full cost accounting rules of the sec  the company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and deferred income taxes  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  net of related tax effects 
these rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
the company recorded a million pre tax million net of tax non cash write down of the carrying value of the company s us proved oil and gas properties as of december   due to these ceiling test limitations 
if oil and gas prices deteriorate from the company s year end realized prices  it is likely that additional write downs will occur in write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of the current low price of crude oil  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
