certain competitive and industry trends include the following 
rapiscan usa and its competitors in the security and inspection business have been experiencing weakness in the domestic market  partly as a result of hesitation by airlines to order security and inspection equipment pending a decision by the faa to buy cabin baggage scanners using current technology 
the faa has leased  with an option to buy  ten such scanners from the company 
faa trials are continuing 
the incorporation of smi s silicon pressure sensor products into the company s operations has taken longer than originally anticipated

the company has established an internal task force to oversee the incorporation of smi s operations into those of the company 
the company s subsystems optics business is conducted by ferson optics  which manufactures passive components used in other products and systems manufactured by outside parties and the company

the project comprises of four phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  and implementation and testing 
the company s year project is currently in the assessment phase and  with respect to certain information systems and products  is in the remediation phase 
the company s year project is being spearheaded by a special task force comprised of a senior management team as well as other key personnel 
the task force meets on a regular basis to determine and implement the steps necessary to insure that the company becomes fully year compliant 
additionally  the company has established task forces in each of its major subsidiaries with designated year management representation  which report status to the year committee 
this mandate is in effect for foreign subsidiaries as well as us subsidiaries 
the company has upgraded its critical database and believes that it is year compliant 
the financial records of the company s principal us subsidiaries  rapiscan usa  udt sensors and smi have also been upgraded and are year compliant 
following an assessment of the company s financial records system  it was determined that each subsidiary will have its own year compliant system 
the estimated completion date for this implementation is on or before october  the company has completed an upgrade of the telephone systems  including voice mail software  for rapiscan usa and udt sensors 
the cost of these upgrades to date has not been material 
the enterprise resource planning software used by several of the company s operating subsidiaries has been certified as year compliant 
the company is in the assessment and remediation phase of determining year compliance of its own products  which are dependent on third party suppliers and vendors for critical parts 
the company expects to complete this assessment by september  and expects to be able to complete remediation as required by october  based on what the company knows at this time  dos and windows are not year compliant  therefore  the company s products which rely on these products are themselves not year compliant 
the company is in the process of acquiring and installing software  within the company s products  which is year compliant 
the company s products which are not presently year compliant are not affected in terms of performance in any material respect  however  archiving of information may be affected by year noncompliance 
the company s exposure exists with respect to its products under warranty  which were manufactured prior to the software upgrade 
in such cases  the company will offer its customers a software upgrade to a year compliant version 
until the assessment phase is completed  the company is not in a position to know if the costs of upgrading the software used in the manufacture of its products or offering its customers such upgrading will be material 
based on current estimates  the company expects to have completed by september  a full assessment of all hardware  operating systems and software applications in use in the company s information systems  operations and infrastructure on a worldwide basis 
some upgrading is expected to be required 
the costs of such assessment and upgrading are not expected to be material 
required upgrading is expected to be completed on or before october  in addition  the company is in the process of obtaining year compliance statements from the manufacturers of the company s hardware and software products 
the company believes that its greatest potential risks are associated with i its information systems and systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  and ii its reliance on year compliance by the company s vendors and suppliers 
the company is in the process of assessments of its operations and infrastructure  and at present time no significant problems have been identified 
the company has asked its critical vendors  suppliers and customers to complete a year survey to assess the status of their compliance in order to assess the effect it could have on the company 
the company has completed distribution of surveys to its critical vendors and suppliers and in the process of mailing follow up requests to those vendors and suppliers who failed to respond to the initial mailing 
the company has distributed surveys to all of its critical customers and is in the process of mailing follow up requests to those customers who failed to respond to the initial mailing 
due to slow responses from suppliers and customers  the company has not yet determined the full extent of contingency planning that may be required 
based on the status of the assessments made and remediation plans developed to date  the company is not in a position to state the total cost of remediation of all year issues 
costs identified to date have not been material 
the company does not currently expect the costs to be material  and it expects to be able to fund the total costs through operating cash flows 
however  the company has not yet completed all of its assessments  developed remediation for all problems  developed all contingency plans  or completely implemented or tested all of its remediation plans 
based on the company s current analysis and assessment of the state of its year compliance  the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenario involves delays in shipping of parts  including critical parts  by certain of the company s vendors and suppliers 
such delays could cause the company to experience delays in shipping its products 
the company is in process of formulating contingency plans based on review of compliance surveys from its vendors and suppliers 
these plans could include  among other things  increasing inventory of critical parts in late to insure an adequate supply is on hand to minimize shipping delays by the company of its products 
as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation or contingency plans  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations and become material 
in many cases  the company is relying on assurances from suppliers that new and upgraded information systems and other products will be year compliant 
the company plans to test such third party products  but cannot be sure that its tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed in a timely and satisfactory way 
additionally  whereas  the company has made every effort to obtain year compliance status from its critical suppliers and customers it cannot enforce responses 
in those cases where risks could exist  the necessary steps will be taken either by reserve funding  building inventory or alternate sources prior to the end of because the company uses a variety of information systems and has additional systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  the company cannot be sure that all of its systems will work together in a year compliant fashion 
furthermore  the company cannot be sure that it will not suffer business interruptions  either because of its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible for them to fulfill their commitments to the company 
if the company fails to satisfactorily resolve year issues related to its products in a timely manner  it could be exposed to liability to third parties 
the company is continuing to evaluate year related risks and will take such further corrective actions as may be required
