seasonality and quarterly results the company has derived a substantial portion of its total revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to major nascar sanctioned races  four irl races  three nascar craftsman truck series and one national hot rod association nationals racing events 
in  the company currently will host major nascar sanctioned races  five irl races  four nascar craftsman truck series and two major national hot rod association racing events 
in and  the company s second and fourth quarters accounted for and  respectively  of its total annual revenues and and  respectively  of its total annual operating income 
the company sometimes produces minimal operating income or losses during its first and third quarters when it hosts only one major nascar race weekend 
in  the company s operating results for the first and thirds quarters will be significantly impacted by the additional scheduled racing events at lvms 
the concentration of racing events in the second quarter and the growth in the company s operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses will tend to increase operating losses or minimize operating income in future first and third quarters 
also  race dates at the company s various facilities may be changed from time to time  lessening the comparability of the financial results of quarters between years and increasing or decreasing the seasonal nature of the company s business

the busch grand national series race at ams  originally scheduled to be held in march  was rescheduled to november due to poor weather conditions 
rescheduling did not materially impact revenues and operating expenses as reported for the first and fourth quarters of liquidity and capital resources the company has historically met its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and other debt and equity offerings 
the company expended significant amounts of cash in for the acquisition of lvms in december  for improvements and expansion at bms  lmsc and tms  and the exercise of the spr purchase option on february  as further described below 
significant changes in the company s financial condition and liquidity during resulted primarily from net cash generated by operations amounting to million  capital expenditures amounting to million  and net borrowings of million  including amendment of the company s bank credit facility to fund the december acquisition of lvms costing approximately million as further described below 
amended bank credit facility and bridge loan 
on november   the company s credit facility dated as of august  was amended and restated in connection with the december  acquisition of lvms 
the amended credit facility and bridge loan the bridge loan increased the company s overall borrowing limit from  to  to fund the lvms acquisition and maintain a revolving credit facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
the bridge loan matures on may  at december   the company had  in outstanding borrowings under the bridge loan 
interest  standby letters of credit terms and restrictive and required financial covenants are generally similar to those prior to amendment 
the bridge loan was obtained from nationsbank na  and is an unsecured  senior revolving credit facility and term loan with a  borrowing sub limit for standby letters of credit 
interest is based  at the company s option  upon i libor plus or ii the greater of nationsbank s prime rate or the federal fund rate plus 
because the bridge loan matures may   replacement debt and equity offering alternatives are being evaluated by the company 
the company presently intends to refinance its revolving credit facility with a syndicated bank group including nationsbank as an agent and lender 
while the company does not believe that the bridge loan s maturity will result in the use of significant working capital  the amount outstanding has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated december  balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in conjunction with seeking replacement financing  the company also intends to retain a revolving credit facility with sufficient overall borrowing limits for working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of additional terms and restrictive covenants of the bridge loan 
management anticipates that cash from operations  and funds available through bridge loan replacement debt and equity offering alternatives  including retention of a revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating needs through  including planned capital expenditures at its speedway facilities 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  management expects that the company will  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
while the company expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from its existing speedway operations  and has generally experienced improvement in its financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  such resources  as well as possibly others  could be needed to fund the company s continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of its speedway facilities 
exercise of spr purchase option 
on february   the real estate purchase option on spr was consummated for  net cash outlay  thereby transferring ownership of the spr complex to the company and eliminating its capital lease obligation 
the purchase transaction was funded with borrowings from the company s credit facility 
acquisition of lvms 
on december   the company acquired certain tangible and intangible assets  including the real and personal property and operations of lvms  an industrial park and certain adjacent unimproved land for approximately  consisting principally of net cash outlay of  and assumed associated deferred revenue 
the acquisition was financed through borrowings under the bridge loan 
capital expenditures significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
in  ams installed lighting for its inaugural irl night race in august 
in  bms added approximately  permanent grandstand seats  including new luxury suites  featuring a new stadium style terrace section and mezzanine level facilities  and made other site improvements 
lmsc added approximately  permanent seats  including new luxury suites  also featuring a stadium style terrace section and mezzanine level facilities 
also in  lmsc and spr further expanded their parking areas  and spr acquired adjoining land to provide an additional entrance  to accommodate the increases in attendance and to ease congestion  and made other site improvements 
spr also was partially reconfigured into a stadium style road course featuring the chute which provides spectators improved sight lines and expanded viewing areas 
in  tms significantly expanded its parking areas and improved traffic control dramatically reducing travel congestion and added approximately  permanent seats  among making other site improvements 
in  ams plans to continue improving and expanding its on site roads and available parking  as well as reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances  to ease congestion and improve traffic flow 
bms is reconstructing and expanding its dragstrip with permanent grandstand seating  luxury suites  and extensive fan amenities and facilities 
construction of the bristol dragway is expected to be completed in lmsc plans to add approximately  permanent seats  further expand concessions  restroom and other fan amenities facilities  and make other site improvements 
in  lvms plans to add approximately  permanent seats  expand concessions  restroom and other fan amenities facilities  and make other site improvements 
spr plans to further expand and improve seating and viewing areas to increase spectator comfort and enjoyment 
also in  pending governmental approvals  the company expects to begin major renovations at spr  including its on going reconfiguration into a stadium style road racing course  the addition of approximately  permanent seats  and improving and expanding concessions  restroom and other fan amenities facilities 
construction of the texas motor speedway club and corporate offices was substantially completed with their opening in march in  after adding approximately  permanent seats  exclusive of spr  the company s total permanent seating capacity will exceed  and the total number of luxury suites will be approximately the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in will approximate million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at the company s facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in the design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from the company s estimates if the company s assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost 
in addition to expansion and improvements of its existing speedway facilities and business operations  the company is continually evaluating new opportunities that will add value for the company s stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of its existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets and the expansion into complementary businesses 
dividends the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
any decision concerning the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend upon the results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans of the company  as well as such factors as permissibility under the bridge loan  the senior subordinated notes and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the bridge loan and senior subordinated notes preclude the payment of any dividends 
impact of new accounting standards the company adopted sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income in sfas no 
specifies that components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
because the company does not have material items of other comprehensive income  adoption did not result in presentation or financial statements significantly different from that under previous accounting standards 
the company also adopted sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information in sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting selected information about operating segments determined using quantitative thresholds and a management approach  which reflects how the chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources 
the combined operations of the company s speedways comprise one operating segment  and encompasses all admissions and event related revenues and associated expenses 
other company operations presently are not considered significant relative to those of the speedways 
as such  adoption had no effect on the company s financial statements or disclosures 
automated systems and the year the ability of automated systems to recognize the date change from december  to january  is commonly referred to as the year matter 
the company has assessed the potential impact of the year matter on its operations based on current and foreseeable computer and other automated system applications  including those of its significant third party vendors  suppliers and customers 
the nature of the company s business does not require significant reliance on automated systems applications except for its ticketing systems  which presently are believed to be compliant 
for critical systems  contingency plans may include utilizing alternative processing methods and manual processes  among others 
should year problems arise  management believes interruption to company operations would be limited principally to delays in capital projects during the first two months of also  management is not aware of any significant potential year problems or risks involving third parties based on the nature of the company s relationships with third parties such as nascar and other sanctioning bodies  network and cable television companies  major sponsors  and financial services companies 
management believes that any potential adverse consequences or risk of financial loss from year issues are substantially mitigated as the company s first significant racing event  as presently scheduled  does not occur until march although year problems could cause temporary minor inconveniences  the company and third parties likely would have over two months to resolve any significant year matters that might arise 
while no assurances can be given  the company s assessment has determined that the potential consequences of year problems  if any  would not materially adversely impact its business  or cause the company to incur potential liabilities to third parties if its systems were not year compliant 
the costs associated with modifying its computer software and other automated systems for year matters has not been  and is not expected to be  significant 
the aggregate incremental costs associated with the company s year compliance are expected to be less than  in addition  management is not aware of any year issues which would materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity or future results of operations 
environmental matters the company s property at lmsc includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the lmsc property ceased in there are two landfills currently operating at lmsc  however  that are permitted to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities lcid landfills 
two other lcid landfills on the lmsc property were closed in lmsc intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the lmsc property in the future 
lmsc also leases certain lmsc property to a bfi subsidiary for use as c d landfill  which can receive solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but cannot receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
in addition  the bfi subsidiary owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to lmsc 
management believes that the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
management also believes that the company s operations  including the landfills and facilities on its property  are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management is not aware of any situations related to landfill operations which it expects would materially adversely affect the company s financial position or future results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s financial instruments with market risk exposure consist only of bank revolving credit facility and bridge loan borrowings which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility and bridge loan in was and the total outstanding balance was  as of december  a change in interest rates of one percent on this balance would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million
