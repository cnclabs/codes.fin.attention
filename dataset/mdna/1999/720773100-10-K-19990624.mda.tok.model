item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net sales are comprised primarily of sales generated by stores and  until august   wholesale sales  primarily to a licensee operating in the state of florida the florida licensee 
cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the cost of merchandise  rent and other occupancy expenses and the cost of preparing merchandise for sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store and supervisory payroll  corporate overhead and non occupancy store expenses  including depreciation on kiosks 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses excluding depreciation on kiosks gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses including depreciation on kiosks income from operations interest and other income interest expense earnings before income taxes income taxes net income comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to net sales generated by new stores opened or acquired by the company and to a  or  increase in comparable store net sales 
at march   the company operated stores compared to stores at march   an increase of 
the average jewelry units sold per comparable store were relatively unchanged at  in fiscal from  in fiscal the average price per jewelry unit sold for all the company s stores was also relatively unchanged at in fiscal from in fiscal included in total net sales is approximately  of wholesale sales to the florida licensee  compared to million in fiscal on august   the company purchased all of the outstanding stock of the florida licensee and began operating the former licensee s stores as its own 
accordingly  wholesale sales ceased on that date and all subsequent sales activity of the acquired stores is reflected as part of the company s own net sales 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross profit margin remained level at for both periods 
gross profit margin  while unchanged in total  reflects an increase caused by the conversion of sales from wholesale to retail sales at the stores acquired from the former florida licensee  offset by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher rent and occupancy expenses 
the company realizes a higher margin on its own retail sales than it previously obtained on wholesale sales to the former florida licensee which caused the increase in gross profit margin 
merchandise margins declined due to greater promotional activity in an attempt to increase sales  particularly at the company s comparable stores 
the increase in rent and occupancy as a percentage of sales reflects the less than expected sales performance at the company s comparable stores  particularly during the holiday season  as well as lower sales at other under performing stores and the lower initial sales volumes at new stores opened by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the combined effect of non recurring pre opening costs  lower than expected sales results at many of the acquired locations and expenses recorded to close under performing stores resulted in the significant increase in both selling  general and administrative expenses and their relationship to net sales 
during fiscal  the company opened new and acquired stores  including former gcg locations 
this represents the largest number of new stores the company has ever opened in a single fiscal year 
after a review of the initial sales results and future sales potential of the locations acquired from gcg  the company announced on september  that it would close of these locations by march  and work to improve operations at the remaining stores 
in addition the company chose to close another under performing stores by year end  bringing the total stores closed in fiscal to  the largest number of stores the company has ever closed in one fiscal year 
during fiscal  the company recognized approximately million of store closure costs as additional selling  general and administrative expense of which million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities at march  these costs include estimated outstanding lease obligations and kiosk disposal costs associated with the stores the company closed in fiscal and additional locations for which a closure decision had been made at march   but which are scheduled to close in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was due primarily to capital expenditures for new stores and the upgrading of kiosks in existing locations 
additionally  amortization expense for goodwill increased due to the acquisition of former gcg stores and the stores acquired from the former florida licensee in july and august  respectively 
approximately million of goodwill was recorded in connection with these two acquisitions and is being amortized over fifteen years 
goodwill amortization expense totaled million and  in fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
the increase in interest expense  which includes interest paid on bank borrowings  fees paid for letters of credit as part of the company s gold consignment program and gold consignment fees  primarily reflects an increase in total average borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and an increase in the number of ounces consigned under the company s gold consignment program 
these were partially offset by lower average weighted interest rates on borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit versus and lower consignment rates charged by the company s gold banks versus 
income tax expense income tax expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  income tax expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in income tax expense is due to the decrease in the company s earnings before income taxes 
the higher effective income tax rate in resulted from the effect of certain acquisition related costs and other charges for which there were no corresponding tax benefits and an additional  of income taxes recognized for potential state income exposure for periods currently under audit 
net income the company s net income decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company believes that the decrease resulted primarily from the factors described above 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to net sales generated by new stores opened or acquired by the company and to a million  or  increase in comparable store net sales 
at march   the company operated stores compared to stores at march  the average jewelry units sold per comparable store decreased slightly  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this is due in part to the additional stores included in the comparable store base in fiscal that generally had lower dollar and unit sales volume than the company s older comparable stores 
the average price per jewelry unit sold for all the company s stores increased slightly  or  to in fiscal from in fiscal wholesale sales to the florida licensee increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal to support the increased retail sales of the florida licensee including sales at three additional locations purchased from the company during fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross profit margin improvement primarily reflects lower costs of merchandise during the period  partially offset by an increase in promotional events held by the company during fiscal versus fiscal the gross profit margin improvement was also reduced by increased rent and occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales due to the new and acquired stores opened during the year and their lower initial sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects higher expenses associated with new stores opened and acquired by the company 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was due primarily to capital expenditures for new stores and the upgrading of kiosks in existing locations as well as higher amortization expense for goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions in february and april a total of million of goodwill was recorded in connection with these two acquisitions and is being amortized over fifteen years 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at in fiscal and the increase in interest expense  which includes interest paid on bank borrowings  fees paid for letters of credit as part of the company s gold consignment program and gold consignment fees  primarily reflects an increase in total average borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and an increase in the number of ounces consigned under the company s gold consignment program 
these increases were partially offset by a lower average interest rate on the revolving line of credit  which was in place for all of fiscal  and the use of the proceeds of a secondary offering of the company s common stock in june of to repay debt incurred in connection with acquisitions 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  income tax expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in income tax expense is due to the increase in the company s earnings before income taxes 
the higher effective income tax rate in resulted from the effect of certain acquisition related costs and other charges for which there were no corresponding tax benefits 
net income the company s net income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company believes that such increase resulted primarily from the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary ongoing short term capital requirements have been to fund an increase in inventory and to fund capital expenditures and working capital mostly inventory for new and acquired stores 
the company s long term liquidity requirements relate principally to the maturity of its long term debt in july of  operating lease commitments and store expansion 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided from operations  a gold consignment program  bank borrowings and a public offering of common stock that was completed during fiscal the company had working capital of million and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
see seasonality 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal primarily reflects net earnings plus depreciation and amortization  partially offset by changes in working capital requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal reflects net earnings plus depreciation and amortization  including increases in inventory to support new and acquired store growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts reflect million and million of capital expenditures related to new stores in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal  the company paid million for the acquisition of former gcg locations and million for all of the outstanding stock of the former florida licensee 
in fiscal  the company paid million for the acquisition of locations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and  in fiscal these changes in net cash provided by financing activities over the last two fiscal years primarily reflect the company s expansion and acquisition activity during those periods 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects an increase in the company s revolving line of credit and additional long term debt 
these increases were used to fund store expansion  acquisitions and the construction of an additional warehouse and distribution center 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects the proceeds of an offering of common stock completed in july  partially offset by a repayment of funds previously borrowed under the company s revolving line of credit 
the company currently has an unsecured revolving line of credit facility  which expires july   that provides for maximum borrowings of million through a combination of cash advances which may not exceed million and letters of credit which may not exceed million to support the company s gold consignment financing program 
amounts borrowed under the facility generally accrue interest at the higher of i the prime rate of the company s primary lender minus basis points at march  or ii a rate based on overnight federal funds transactions with federal reserve system members plus basis points at march   however  the company may elect to have all or any portion of the outstanding balance under the facility accrue interest at a rate based on one  two  three or six month libor plus basis points at march  for a one month maturity  subject to certain restrictions 
fees are paid on letters of credit based on amounts outstanding at an annual rate of 
at march   the company had million available for cash borrowings under this revolving credit facility 
letters of credit in the amounts of approximately million and approximately million were issued at march  and  respectively 
the loan agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  limit certain corporate acts of the company such as mergers and acquisitions  require the company to maintain minimum ratios of indebtedness to adjusted net income as defined  current assets to current liabilities and indebtedness to capitalization as defined  place limitations on the company s ability to incur additional debt or grant security interests in its assets  and restrict the redemption  purchase or retirement of its capital stock 
the company utilizes gold consignment arrangements that allow the company to finance its gold merchandise at rates which are less than its traditional bank borrowing rates 
under the consignment arrangements  the company generally sells to a consignor the gold content of the merchandise that it owns and simultaneously has the gold consigned back to the company 
the jewelry containing the consigned gold is commingled with the gold jewelry owned by the company 
the company s obligation to the consignors is based upon the price of gold at the time of the sale by the company of the consigned gold and  therefore  is subject to fluctuation based on changes in the market value of gold 
if the gold ounces in merchandise held for sale by the company is about to be reduced below the amount of gold consigned  the company either repurchases the gold from a consignor or purchases additional gold jewelry from suppliers to support the amount of consigned gold 
in the event the price of gold at the time of such repurchases or purchases is greater than the price at the time the gold was originally sold to the consignor  the company s gross profit margin will be decreased 
the company does not engage  and currently has no plans to engage  in hedging transactions to protect against fluctuations in the market value of gold or to lock in prices for future purchases 
the company does  however  manage the amount of gold consigned in relation to its total merchandise available for sale in order to provide the company with the flexibility to consign or repurchase gold according to seasonal fluctuations in merchandise levels and sales 
during fiscal and  average financing costs under the consignment agreements were approximately and per annum  respectively  of the market value of the gold held under consignment 
additionally  the current consignment agreements require a letter of credit to support the market value of the gold consigned to the company 
the financing cost to the company of the consignment program is substantially less than the cost that would have been incurred if the company financed the purchase of all of its gold requirements with borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company s current gold consignment arrangements are terminable by either party upon either or days notice  depending on the consignor 
gold consignment programs are common in the gold jewelry industry and the company believes that  if the institutions with which it currently has gold consignment agreements were to terminate such agreements  it would have a number of opportunities to establish gold consignment programs with terms similar to its current arrangements 
during the last two fiscal years  the company has financed an average of approximately of the gold content of its merchandise under the consignment program 
as of march   the amount of gold consigned was  ounces with a value of million and  ounces with a value of million at march  the consigned gold is not included in inventory on the company s balance sheet and  therefore  there is no related liability recorded 
if the market value of gold increases  assuming the number of ounces consigned remain constant  the financing costs incurred by the company which are included in interest expense  and the repayment obligations to the consignors under the consignment arrangements  will increase in proportion to the increase in the market value of gold 
additionally  the amount of the letters of credit would need to be increased to support the increased market value of the consigned gold  thereby reducing the amount which might otherwise be available for cash borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal to total approximately million  of which approximately million is related primarily to the construction of new stores and the renovation of existing stores 
the company currently anticipates opening approximately to new stores in fiscal the opening of a new store generally requires a total investment of approximately  including approximately  of inventory a portion of which is generally financed through consignment arrangements   for construction of the kiosk  fixtures  point of sale register and other equipment and supplies and  for pre opening expenses which are expensed when incurred 
the company believes that the expected net cash provided by operating activities  its gold consignment program and bank borrowings under its revolving line of credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s currently anticipated capital and liquidity needs 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal 
due to the impact of the holiday shopping season  the company experiences a substantial portion of its total net sales and profitability in its third fiscal quarter ending december st 
during the last two fiscal years  the month of december  on average  has accounted for approximately of the company s annual net sales and of its annual income from operations 
the company has generally experienced lower net sales in each of the first  second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  and lower net income or net losses in each of those quarters 
quarterly data set forth below is certain summary information with respect to the company s operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters fiscal fiscal st nd rd th st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except per share data statement of income data net sales         gross profit         selling  general and administrative expenses         income loss from operations    net income loss    diluted earnings loss per share comparable store net sales increase decrease as a percentage of net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations net income loss gross profit excludes depreciation on kiosks 
depreciation on kiosks is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if for any reason the company s net sales were below those normally expected for the third fiscal quarter  and  in particular  the month of december  the company s annual financial results would be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for a build up of merchandise for the holiday season 
historically  the company s working capital requirement is at its lowest level in january  increases steadily through the end of november  when it reaches its highest level  and declines rapidly through the holiday season 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors  including the amount and timing of acquisitions and new store openings  the integration of recently acquired and newly opened stores into the operations of the company  the timing of promotions  fluctuations in the price of gold  and changes in national and regional economic conditions 
for example  earnings from operations in the first and second and fourth quarters of fiscal and have been adversely affected by the integration and assimilation of stores opened or acquired over the last three fiscal years 
this was due primarily to the relatively fixed nature of rent and other occupancy costs and selling  general and administrative costs associated with the recently acquired and newly opened stores  which had a significant adverse impact on these lower net sales volume quarters 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in the united states 
the company s leases for stores typically provide for a percentage rent based on store sales and  therefore  to the extent retail prices increase  there may be an increase in occupancy costs 
generally  the company prices its gold merchandise based on the price it paid suppliers for the merchandise and does not reprice the items based upon normal fluctuations in the price of gold 
while inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year compliance the information set forth in this section is a year readiness disclosure as defined in the year information readiness and disclosure act 
the company is aware of year issues existing in the programming code of some information technology it and non it systems 
the year issue may arise because many hardware and software systems only use two digits to represent the year 
as a result  these systems may not be able to process dates beyond  which may cause errors or failures in it or non it systems 
the company relies significantly on both it and non it systems in its retail outlets as well as at its corporate headquarters and distribution center 
these systems include hardware and software that the company uses to conduct its operations  analyze business performance and safeguard assets 
the company is currently performing a comprehensive review of these systems in preparation for the year the company s strategy for addressing year compliance is to replace or renovate all critical systems identified as non compliant by a target date of july  followed by final testing and remediation by september  the first phase of this approach involves identifying all critical it and non it systems and making an initial assessment of each as either year compliant or non compliant 
the company is substantially complete with this phase of its year review and has nearly completed the replacement or renovation of systems which were found to be non compliant 
the process of testing the compliance of systems initially assessed as compliant  as well as the replaced or renovated systems  has also begun and is progressing according to the company s original schedule 
to date  the company has met all costs of its year remediation efforts with existing internal staff resources and has spent less than  on hardware and software purchased to specifically address year issues 
the cost of these efforts has not been separately tracked or allocated and  accordingly  the company cannot precisely determine the expense incurred 
the company does not anticipate future year costs will be material and will continue to use internal staff supplemented by external resources if necessary 
the company expects its own year project to be completed on a timely basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems also rely will be compliant 
the company is seeking confirmation from its primary vendors that they are developing and implementing plans to become year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties  which are not within the control of the company  will function properly 
the failure of certain primary vendors to be year compliant may have an adverse impact on the company s performance 
the company is developing contingency plans as part of its remediation efforts and the company expects such plans to be completed by september while the company continues to believe that the year matters discussed above will not have a material impact on its business  financial condition or results of operations  it remains uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   however  the financial accounting standards board has proposed a one year delay in implementation 
the company does not anticipate adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the aicpa accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
the sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary stage and the post implementation operations stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has adopted this standard effective april  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure is from changes in interest rates  the company s policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments and  in fiscal  an interest rate swap agreement 
generally  the company seeks to match the terms of its debt with its purpose 
the company uses a variable rate line of credit to provide working capital for operations and inventory build up prior to the holiday selling season 
construction and improvements to the company s headquarters and warehouse and distribution center are financed with long term  fixed rate notes 
in fiscal  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a new long term note to effectively convert it from a variable rate note to a fixed rate note 
a standard interest rate swap agreement involves the payment of a fixed rate times a notional amount by one party in exchange for a floating rate times the same notional from another party 
the company originated the long term note as a variable rate instrument in anticipation of a decline in interest rates  then used the interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate 
the counterparty to the swap agreement is one of the company s primary lenders under its revolving line of credit 
the table below summarizes the company s market risks associated with long term debt obligations and its interest rate swap as of march  for long term debt obligations  the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by expected year of maturity 
for the interest rate swap  the table reflects the notional amount underlying the interest rate swap by year of maturity 
the notional amount is used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received 
fair values were computed based upon discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period

in addition  actual cash flows of financial instruments may differ materially from cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in interest rates and company debt levels
