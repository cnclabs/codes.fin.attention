gas pipeline group continues to expand its pipeline system to provide services to existing customers and new markets 
florida gas has an expansion planned to provide new capacity of mmcf d into southwest florida by the year and is evaluating other expansions to meet florida s expected strong growth in gas consumption 
future results of northern border pipeline will reflect its mmcf d extension of service to the chicago market area 
a further expansion to indiana through a mile  mmcf d extension of its pipeline will be placed in service in the year transwestern is considering expansions to bring in additional supplies from the san juan basin to california 
portland general anticipates continuing retail customer growth in one of the fastest growing service territories in the us in late  portland general filed a customer choice plan proposal and rate case with the oregon public utility commission opuc which would open its service territory to competition 
under the proposed customer choice plan  portland general would separate its generation business from its transmission and distribution businesses and portland general would become a regulated transmission and distribution company focused on delivering  but not selling  electricity 
in july  the opuc staff issued its position  disagreeing with portland general s proposal for full customer choice 
in january  the opuc issued an order  which is contingent upon the adoption of certain regulatory changes by the oregon legislature  with recommendations that included allowing small retail customers a limited set of options including the ability to continue to purchase rate regulated electricity  allowing most commercial and industrial users to have the ability to choose their electricity provider and allowing portland general to sell its coal and gas fired generation plants but rejecting portland general s request to sell its hydroelectric assets 
additionally  the order requires portland general  should it choose to adopt opuc s recommendations  to file a new rate case 
portland general is reviewing the opuc order  but will not implement any of the recommendations until the changes are agreed upon by all parties 
the issue of restructuring will be further addressed by the oregon legislature 
portland general will support legislation that creates a comprehensive approach to the electricity industry that helps develop a market that is truly competitive 
wholesale energy operations and services enron s wholesale energy operations and services business enron wholesale operates in north america  europe and other countries 
activities are conducted primarily by enron capital trade resources and enron international 
enron wholesale is categorized into two business lines a commodity sales and services and b energy assets and investments 
integrated energy related products and services related to these business lines are offered to wholesale customers in varying degrees in each of enron wholesale s markets 
enron manages its commodity and asset portfolios in order to maximize value  minimize the associated risks and provide overall liquidity 
in this process  enron utilizes portfolio and risk management disciplines including certain hedging transactions to manage portions of its market exposures commodity  interest rate  foreign currency and equity exposures 
enron wholesale from time to time monetizes its contract portfolios producing cash and transferring counterparty credit risk to third parties and sells interests in investments and assets 
the following table reflects ibit for each business line in millions commodity sales and services energy assets and investments unallocated expenses reported income before interest  minority interests and taxes the following discussion analyzes the contributions to ibit for each business line 
commodity sales and services 
enron wholesale provides reliable delivery of energy commodities at predictable prices 
the commodity sales and services operations includes the purchase  sale  marketing and delivery of natural gas  electricity  liquids and other commodities  restructuring of existing long term contracts and the management of enron s commodity contract portfolios 
in addition  enron provides risk management products and services to energy customers that hedge movements in price and location based price differentials 
enron s risk management products and services are designed to provide stability to customers in markets impacted by commodity price volatility 
also included in this business is the management of certain operating assets that directly relate to this business  including domestic intrastate pipelines and storage facilities 
enron wholesale markets and transports a substantial quantity of energy commodities as reflected in the following table including intercompany amounts physical volumes bbtue d a b gas united states    canada    europe and other  transport volumes total gas volumes    crude oil and liquids    electricity c    total physical volumes bbtue d    electricity volumes marketed thousand mwh united states    europe and other total    financial settlements notional bbtue d    a billion british thermal units equivalent per day 
b includes third party transactions by enron energy services 
c represents electricity volumes marketed  converted to bbtue d 
the earnings from commodity sales and services operations increased in as compared to the change is primarily due to increased earnings from originations of risk management products and services in north america  including contract restructurings  and increased power marketing earnings  where volumes have increased over  partially offset by fewer originations in europe  lower earnings related to domestic operating assets and higher expenses 
the earnings from commodity sales and services operations decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower domestic gas and power margins in compared with although volumes were higher in  greater seasonal volatility of domestic natural gas prices provided higher margins in domestic liquids marketing activity was also lower in compared with these decreases were partially offset by increased activity in the european markets related to natural gas and power contracts  including originations with utilities and independent power producers ipps in originations from long term contracts in north america decreased in for both natural gas and power 
energy assets and investments 
enron wholesale s energy assets and investments activities include investments in debt and equity securities of oil and gas producers and other energy intensive companies 
additionally  enron wholesale develops  constructs  operates and manages a large portfolio of energy investments such as power plants and natural gas pipelines 
earnings primarily result from changes in the market value of merchant investments held during the period  equity earnings and gains on sales or restructurings of energy investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these investments 
earnings from energy assets and investments increased in as compared to primarily as a result of earnings from the sale of interests in the puerto rico  turkey  italy and uk power projects  from which enron realized the value created during the development and construction phases  partially offset by development costs and decreased earnings from the management of enron wholesale s merchant investments 
some of these transactions involved securitizations in which enron retained certain interests associated with the underlying assets 
earnings from energy assets and investments increased in compared with due primarily to a significant increase in the market value of its investments  including the positive impact of a change in the structure of a joint venture investment  as well as increased earnings from originations and earnings from the sale of interests in uk power projects 
also contributing to the increase were fees earned on projects in the uk unallocated expenses 
net unallocated expenses include rent  systems expenses and other support group costs 
outlook enron anticipates continued growth in enron wholesale during due to further expansion into new products and markets 
in the commodity sales and services business  volumes are expected to continue to increase as enron maintains or increases its market share in the growing unregulated us power market and the european gas and power markets 
in addition  enron expects to benefit from opportunities related to its substantial portfolio of commodity contracts 
enron also expects to continue increased integration of financial products with its energy commodity portfolio 
in the energy assets and investments business  enron will continue to benefit from opportunities related to its energy investments  including sales or restructurings of appreciated investments  and in providing capital to energy intensive customers 
equity earnings from operations are expected to increase as a result of commencement of commercial operations of new power plants and pipeline in early including the larger power project in india 
at december   the following international projects were under construction estimated commercial size capacity operations date pipeline a bolivia brazil phase i  miles q power plants a cuiaba brazil phase i mw b q dabhol india phase i mw q piti guam mw q sutton bridge uk mw q trakya turkey mw q corinto nicaragua mw q ecoelectrica puerto rico mw q nowa sarzyna poland mw q sarlux italy mw q a enron holds varying interests in these projects 
b megawatts 
earnings from enron wholesale are dependent on the origination and completion of transactions  some of which are individually significant and which are impacted by market conditions  the regulatory environment and customer relationships 
enron wholesale s transactions have historically been based on a diverse product portfolio  providing a solid base of earnings 
enron s strengths  including its ability to identify and respond to customer needs  access to extensive physical assets and its integrated approach to meeting customers needs  are important drivers of the expected continued earnings growth 
in addition  significant earnings are expected from enron wholesale s commodity portfolio and investments  which are subject to market fluctuations 
external factors  such as the amount of volatility in market prices  impact the earnings opportunity associated with enron wholesale s business 
risk related to these activities is managed using naturally offsetting transactions and hedge transactions 
the effectiveness of enron s risk management activities can have a material impact on future earnings 
see financial risk management for a discussion of market risk related to enron wholesale 
retail energy services enron energy services energy services  formed in late  is extending enron s energy expertise to end use business customers 
this includes sales of natural gas  electricity and outsourcing energy management services directly to commercial and industrial customers 
energy services reported losses before interest  minority interests and taxes of million in and million in related to significant investments in building its sales and service capabilities  developing products and services  establishing a support system to service its contracts and supporting energy services regulatory efforts 
during  energy services completed a significant number of transactions which will provide future revenues and margins 
energy services revenues totaled billion during  a increase from in late  enron sold approximately of its ownership of energy services for million  to defray startup costs and establish a valuation for this new business 
the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of million  which has been reflected in corporate and other 
this sale of energy services ownership reflected a total enterprise value of billion 
since that time  significant new customers and long term contracts have been obtained 
outlook during  enron anticipates continued growth in the demand for energy outsourcing solutions 
energy services will focus on delivering these services to its existing customers  while continuing to expand its commercial and industrial customer base for total energy outsourcing 
energy services also plans to continue integrating its service delivery capabilities  focusing on the development of best practices  nation wide procurement opportunities  efficient use of capital and centralized decision making

enron also recorded a million charge to reflect losses on contracted mtbe production 
during  enron recorded a non recurring charge of million  primarily reflecting the impact of enron s amended j block gas contract in the uk  and a million charge primarily to reflect losses on contracted mtbe production 
in  a gain of million was recognized  primarily related to the sale of million outstanding shares of eog stock held by enron 
the results included an million reserve related to the required disposition of certain assets in connection with the merger with portland general 
interest and related charges  net interest and related charges  net of interest capitalized  increased million in and million in the increase in as compared to was primarily a result of higher debt levels  including the issuance of approximately billion in debt between november and the end of  mainly to finance capital expenditures and investments 
the interest expense also reflects the impact of twelve months of interest expense on debt related to the merger with portland general 
the increase was primarily due to higher debt levels  including debt of billion from portland general following the merger on july  see note to the consolidated financial statements

income tax expense decreased for as compared to primarily as a result of pretax losses due to the non recurring charges for the restructuring of enron s j block contract and for losses on contracted mtbe production 
in addition  the tax provision was reduced for differences between the book and tax basis of certain assets and stock sales 
year the year problem results from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the use of two digits was a common practice for decades when computer storage and processing was much more expensive than today 
when computer systems must process dates both before and after january   two digit year fields may create processing ambiguities that can cause errors and system failures 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive features may recognize a date represented by as the year  instead of these errors or failures may have limited effects  or the effects may be widespread  depending on the computer chip  system or software  and its location and function 
the effects of the year problem are exacerbated because of the interdependence of computer and telecommunications systems in the united states and throughout the world 
this interdependence certainly is true for enron and enron s suppliers  trading partners  and customers  as well as for governments of countries around the world where enron does business 
state of readiness enron s board of directors has been briefed about the year problems generally and as they may affect enron 
the board has adopted a year plan the plan covering all of enron s business units 
the aim of the plan is to take reasonable steps to prevent enron s mission critical functions from being impaired due to the year problem 
mission critical functions are those critical functions whose loss would cause an immediate stoppage of or significant impairment to major business areas a major business area is one of material importance to enron s business 
implementation of enron s year plan is directly supervised by a senior vice president who is aided by a year project director 
the project director coordinates the implementation of the plan among enron s business units 
as part of the overall plan  each business unit in turn has developed  and is implementing  a year plan specific to it 
enron also has engaged outside consultants  technicians and other external resources to aid in formulating and implementing the plan 
enron is implementing the plan  which will be modified as events warrant 
under the plan  enron will continue to inventory its mission critical computer hardware and software systems and embedded chips computer chips with date related functions  contained in a wide variety of devices  assess the effects of year problems on the mission critical functions of enron s business units  remedy systems  software and embedded chips in an effort to avoid material disruptions or other material adverse effects on mission critical functions  processes and systems  verify and test the mission critical systems to which remediation efforts have been applied  and attempt to mitigate those mission critical aspects of the year problem that are not remediated by january   including the development of contingency plans to cope with the mission critical consequences of year problems that have not been identified or remediated by that date 
the plan recognizes that the computer  telecommunications  and other systems outside systems of outside entities outside entities have the potential for major  mission critical  adverse effects on the conduct of enron s business 
enron does not have control of these outside entities or outside systems 
in some cases  outside entities are foreign governments or businesses located in foreign countries 
however  enron s plan includes an ongoing process of identifying and contacting outside entities whose systems  in enron s judgment  have or may have a substantial effect on enron s ability to continue to conduct the mission critical aspects of its business without disruption from year problems 
the plan envisions enron attempting to inventory and assess the extent to which these outside systems may not be year ready or year compatible 
enron will attempt reasonably to coordinate with these outside entities in an ongoing effort to obtain assurance that the outside systems that are mission critical to enron will be year compatible well before january  consequently  enron will work prudently with outside entities in a reasonable attempt to inventory  assess  analyze  convert where necessary  test  and develop contingency plans for enron s connections to these mission critical outside systems and to ascertain the extent to which they are  or can be made to be  year ready and compatible with enron s mission critical systems 
it is important to recognize that the processes of inventorying  assessing  analyzing  converting where necessary  testing  and developing contingency plans for mission critical items in anticipation of the year event are necessarily iterative processes 
that is  the steps are repeated as enron learns more about the year problem and its effects on enron s internal systems and on outside systems  and about the effects that embedded chips may have on enron s systems and outside systems 
as the steps are repeated  it is likely that new problems will be identified and addressed 
enron anticipates that it will continue with these processes through january  and  if necessary based on experience  into the year in order to assess and remediate problems that reasonably can be identified only after the start of the new century 
as of february   enron and all its business units were at various stages in implementation of the plan  as shown in the following tables 
the first table deals with the enron business units mission critical internal systems including embedded chips and the second deals with the business units mission critical outside systems of outside entities

costs to address year issues under the plan and otherwise  enron has not incurred material historical costs for year awareness  inventory  assessment  analysis  conversion  testing  or contingency planning 
further  enron anticipates that its future costs for these purposes  including those for implementing its year contingency plans  will not be material 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance  for the reasons stated in the summary section below  that the actual costs of implementing the plan will not differ materially from the estimated costs or that enron will not be materially adversely affected by year issues 
year risk factors regulatory requirements 
certain of enron s business units operate in industries that are regulated by governmental authorities 
enron expects to satisfy these regulatory authorities requirements for achieving year readiness 
if enron s reasonable expectations in this regard are in error  and if a regulatory authority should order the temporary cessation of enron s operations in one or more of these areas  the adverse effect on enron could be material 
outside entities could face similar problems that materially adversely affect enron 
shortage of resources 
between now and year there will be increased competition for people with the technical and managerial skills necessary to deal with the year problem 
while enron is taking substantial precautions to recruit and retain sufficient people skilled in dealing with the year problem and has hired consultants who bring additional skilled people to deal with the year problem as it affects enron  enron could face shortages of skilled personnel or other resources  such as year ready computer chips  and these shortages might delay or otherwise impair enron s progress towards making its mission critical systems year ready 
outside entities could face similar problems that materially adversely affect enron 
enron believes that the possible impact of the shortage of skilled people is not  and will not be  unique to enron 
potential shortcoming 
enron estimates that its mission critical systems  domestic and international  will be year ready substantially before january  however  there is no assurance that the plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforeseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect enron 
cascading effect 
enron and its business units are taking reasonable steps to identify  assess  and  where appropriate  replace devices that contain embedded chips 
despite these reasonable efforts  enron anticipates that it will not be able to find and remediate all embedded chips in systems in enron s business units 
further  enron anticipates that outside entities on which enron depends also will not be able to find and remediate all embedded chips in their systems 
some of the embedded chips that fail to operate or that produce anomalous results may create system disruptions or failures 
some of these disruptions or failures may spread from the systems in which they are located to other systems in a cascade 
these cascading failures may have adverse effects upon enron s ability to maintain safe operations and may also have adverse effects upon enron s ability to serve its customers and otherwise to fulfill certain contractual and other legal obligations 
the embedded chip problem is widely recognized as one of the more difficult aspects of the year problem across industries and throughout the world 
enron believes that the possible adverse impact of the embedded chip problem is not  and will not be  unique to enron 
third parties 
enron cannot assure that suppliers upon which it depends for essential goods and services will convert and test their mission critical systems and processes in a timely and effective manner 
failure or delay to do so by all or some of these entities  including us federal  state or local governments and foreign governments  could create substantial disruptions having a material adverse affect on enron s business 
contingency plans as part of the plan  enron is developing contingency plans that deal with two aspects of the year problem that enron  despite its good faith  reasonable efforts  may not have satisfactorily remediated all of its internal mission critical systems  and that outside systems may not be year ready  despite enron s good faith  reasonable efforts to work with outside entities 
enron s contingency plans are being designed to minimize the disruptions or other adverse effects resulting from year incompatibilities regarding these mission critical functions or systems  and to facilitate the early identification and remediation of mission critical year problems that first manifest themselves after january  enron s contingency plans will contemplate an assessment of all its mission critical internal information technology systems and its internal operational systems that use computer based controls 
this process will commence in the early minutes of january   and continue for hours  days  or weeks as circumstances require 
further  enron will in that time frame assess any mission critical disruptions due to year related failures that are external to enron 
the assessment process will cover  for example  loss of electrical power from utilities  telecommunications services from carriers  or building access  security  or elevator service in facilities occupied by enron 
enron s contingency plans include the creation of teams that will be standing by on the evening of december   prepared to respond rapidly and otherwise as necessary to mission critical year related problems as soon as they become known 
the composition of teams that are assigned to deal with year problems will vary according to the nature  mission criticality  and location of the problem 
because enron operates internationally  some of its year contingency teams will be stationed at enron s mission critical facilities overseas 
worst case scenario the securities and exchange commission requires that public companies forecast the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
analysis of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios enron may face leads to contemplation of the following possibilities which  though unlikely in some or many cases  must be included in any consideration of worst cases widespread failure of electrical  gas  and similar supplies by utilities serving enron domestically and internationally  widespread disruption of the services of communications common carriers domestically and internationally  similar disruption to means and modes of transportation for enron and its employees  contractors  suppliers  and customers  significant disruption to enron s ability to gain access to  and remain working in  office buildings and other facilities  the failure of substantial numbers of enron s mission critical information computer hardware and software systems  including both internal business systems and systems such as those with embedded chips controlling operational facilities such as electrical generation  transmission  and distribution systems and oil and gas plants and pipelines  domestically and internationally  and the failure  domestically and internationally  of outside systems  the effects of which would have a cumulative material adverse impact on enron s mission critical systems 
among other things  enron could face substantial claims by customers or loss of revenues due to service interruptions  inability to fulfill contractual obligations  inability to account for certain revenues or obligations or to bill customers accurately and on a timely basis  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following mission critical failures  and the execution of contingency plans 
enron could also experience an inability by customers  traders  and others to pay  on a timely basis or at all  obligations owed to enron 
under these circumstances  the adverse effect on enron  and the diminution of enron s revenues  would be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
further in this scenario  the cumulative effect of these failures could have a substantial adverse effect on the economy  domestically and internationally 
the adverse effect on enron  and the diminution of enron s revenues  from a domestic or global recession or depression also is likely to be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
enron will continue to monitor business conditions with the aim of assessing and minimizing adverse effects  if any  that result or may result from the year problem 
summary enron has a plan to deal with the year challenge and believes that it will be able to achieve substantial year readiness with respect to the mission critical systems that it controls 
however  from a forward looking perspective  the extent and magnitude of the year problem as it will affect enron  both before and for some period after january   are difficult to predict or quantify for a number of reasons 
among these are the difficulty of locating embedded chips that may be in a great variety of mission critical hardware used for process or flow control  environmental  transportation  access  communications and other systems  the difficulty of inventorying  assessing  remediating  verifying and testing outside systems  the difficulty in locating all mission critical software computer code internal to enron that is not year compatible  and the unavailability of certain necessary internal or external resources  including but not limited to trained hardware and software engineers  technicians  and other personnel to perform adequate remediation  verification and testing of mission critical enron systems or outside systems 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that all of enron s systems and all outside systems will be adequately remediated so that they are year ready by january   or by some earlier date  so as not to create a material disruption to enron s business 
if  despite enron s reasonable efforts under its year plan  there are mission critical year related failures that create substantial disruptions to enron s business  the adverse impact on enron s business could be material 
additionally  while enron s year costs are not expected to be material  such costs are difficult to estimate accurately because of unanticipated vendor delays  technical difficulties  the impact of tests of outside systems and similar events 
moreover  the estimated costs of implementing the plan do not take into account the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of year related failures that occur despite enron s implementation of the plan 
new accounting pronouncements on april   the aicpa issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that costs for all start up activities and organization costs be expensed as incurred and not capitalized in certain instances  as had previously been allowed 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after and initial adoption is required to be reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
although enron continues to evaluate the impact of adopting sop  it expects to recognize an after tax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of related primarily to differences in timing of commencement of capitalization of project development costs compared to enron s current policy 
this charge will be reflected net of tax as a separate line item in enron s consolidated income statement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement the statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance  however  sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
enron has not yet determined the timing of adoption of sfas no 
enron believes that sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its accounting for price risk management activities but has not yet quantified the effect on its hedging activities or physical base contracts 
in december  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires energy trading contracts to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet  with the changes in fair value included in earnings 
the effect of initial application of eitf will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
because enron currently records its trading activities at fair value  management believes that the adoption of eitf will not have a materially adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
financial condition cash flows in millions cash provided by used in operating activities  investing activities    financing activities   net cash provided by operating activities increased  million in  reflecting positive operating cash flow from enron s major business segments other than retail energy services  which continued investing in its new business 
operating cash flow in also included proceeds from sales of interests in energy related financial assets and cash from timing and other changes related to enron s commodity portfolio 
new investments in merchant assets and investments totaling million partially offset these increases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease of million in was primarily a result of a cash payment of million made in connection with the resolution of the j block gas contract 
net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects increased capital expenditures and equity investments  which total  million in   million in and  million in see capital expenditures and equity investments below 
partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from the sales of assets totaling million in  million in and million in these proceeds were primarily from the sales of liquids assets in and from the sales of million shares of eog common stock held by enron and non strategic gathering and processing assets in cash provided by financing activities in included million from the net issuance of short and long term debt  million from the issuance of common stock and million primarily from the sale of a minority interest in a subsidiary see note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by payments of million for dividends

these inflows were partially offset by payments of million for cash dividends and million for treasury stock 
primary cash inflows from financing activities during included million from the net issuance of short and long term debt  million from the issuance of preferred securities by subsidiary companies and million from the issuance of enron common stock 
cash outflows in included cash dividend payments of million 
working capital at december   enron had a working capital deficit of million 
enron has credit facilities in place to fund working capital requirements 
at december   those credit lines provided for up to billion of committed and uncommitted credit  of which million was outstanding at december  certain of the credit agreements contain prefunding covenants 
however  such covenants are not expected to restrict enron s access to funds under these agreements 
in addition  enron sells commercial paper and has agreements to sell trade accounts receivable  thus providing financing to meet seasonal working capital needs 
management believes that the sources of funding described above are sufficient to meet short and long term liquidity needs not met by cash flows from operations 
capital expenditures and equity investments capital expenditures by operating segment are as follows in millions estimate exploration and production a transportation and distribution wholesale energy operations and services retail energy services corporate and other total    a excludes exploration expenses of million estimate  million  million and million for   and  respectively 
capital expenditures increased million in and million during as compared to the previous year 
during  increased expenditures in exploration and production were primarily a result of the acquisition of producing properties in the gulf of mexico  and enron wholesale expenditures increased primarily related to domestic and international power plant construction 
during  increased expenditures in exploration and production reflect increased development expenditures in the united states and increased property acquisitions in canada 
transportation and distribution expenditures increased due to expansion projects by the interstate natural gas pipelines 
included in enron wholesale were send or pay payments totaling million in and million in related to a transportation agreement in the uk cash used for equity investments by the operating segments is as follows in millions estimate exploration and production transportation and distribution wholesale energy operations and services retail energy services corporate and other total   equity investments increased in as compared to primarily due to the acquisitions of elektro and wessex  net of proceeds from transactions reducing enron s interest in these investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the level of spending for capital expenditures and equity investments will vary depending upon conditions in the energy markets  related economic conditions and identified opportunities 
management expects that the capital spending program will be funded by a combination of internally generated funds  proceeds from dispositions of selected assets  short and long term borrowings and proceeds from the sale of common stock in february capitalization total capitalization at december  was billion 
debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased to at december  as compared to at december  the decrease primarily reflects the issuance during of approximately million shares of common stock and the conversion in late of million exchangeable notes into eog shares held by enron  partially offset by increased debt and minority interests 
enron is a party to certain financial contracts which contain provisions for early settlement in the event of a significant market price decline in which enron s common stock falls below certain levels prices ranging from to per share or if the credit ratings for enron s unsecured  senior long term debt obligations fall below investment grade 
the impact of this early settlement could include the issuance of additional shares of enron common stock 
enron s senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated bbb by standard poor s corporation and baa by moody s investor services 
enron s continued investment grade status is critical to the success of its wholesale businesses as well as its ability to maintain adequate liquidity 
enron s management believes it will be able to maintain or improve its credit rating 
in february  enron issued million shares of common stock in a public offering and approximately million shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of certain assets 
enron has investments in entities whose functional currency is denominated in brazilian reals 
subsequent to december  the exchange rate for brazilian reals to the us dollar has declined 
as a result  enron anticipates recording a non cash foreign currency translation adjustment  reducing shareholders equity  in the first quarter of based on the exchange rate in mid february  the equity reduction would be approximately million 
item a 
financial risk management enron wholesale offers price risk management services primarily related to commodities associated with the energy sector natural gas  crude oil  natural gas liquids and electricity 
these services are provided through a variety of financial instruments including forward contracts  which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity  swap agreements  which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity  options and other contractual arrangements 
interest rate risks and foreign currency risks associated with the fair value of its energy commodities portfolio are managed in this segment using a variety of financial instruments  including financial futures  swaps and options 
in order to mitigate the risk associated with its merchant investments  enron actively manages the systematic or market risks inherent in the investments 
using various analytical methods  enron generally disaggregates and manages the equity index  interest rate and commodity risks embedded in the investments  leaving the specific asset or idiosyncratic risk which is diversified among the investments 
enron s other businesses also enter into forwards  swaps and other contracts primarily for the purpose of hedging the impact of market fluctuations on assets  liabilities  production or other contractual commitments 
changes in the market value of these hedge transactions are deferred until the gain or loss is recognized on the hedged item 
management of the market risks associated with its portfolio of transactions is critical to the success of enron 
therefore  comprehensive risk management processes  policies and procedures have been established to monitor and control these market risks 
enron manages market risk on a portfolio basis  subject to parameters established by its board of directors 
market risks are monitored by an independent risk control group operating separately from the units that create or actively manage these risk exposures to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
enron s fixed price commodity contract portfolio is typically balanced to within an annual average of of the total notional physical and financial transaction volumes marketed 
market risk the use of financial instruments by enron s businesses may expose enron to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity and equity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for enron s wholesale businesses  the major market risks are discussed below commodity price risk 
commodity price risk is a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers as well as owning and operating production facilities 
as discussed above  enron actively manages this risk on a portfolio basis to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
forwards  futures  swaps and options are utilized to manage enron s consolidated exposure to price fluctuations related to production from its production facilities 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is also a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers and having variable rate debt obligations  as changing interest rates impact the discounted value of future cash flows 
enron utilizes swaps  forwards  futures and options to manage its interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the result of enron s international operations and price risk management services provided to its worldwide customer base 
the primary purpose of enron s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency purchase and sale transactions 
enron primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts  futures and purchased options to manage enron s risk profile 
equity risk 
equity risk arises from the energy assets and investments operations of enron wholesale  which provides capital to customers through equity participations in various investment activities 
enron manages this risk by disaggregating the market risks such as equity index  interest rate and commodity risks from the individual investments and managing these risks on a portfolio basis through the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
the idiosyncratic risk or specific risk is managed on both an individual and portfolio basis within the risk management polices 
enron measures the market risk in its investments on a daily basis utilizing value at risk and other methodologies 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products 
the use of these methodologies requires a number of key assumptions including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses  the holding period for liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the value at risk methodologies  including liquidity risk and event risk 
value at risk represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses in earnings that would be recognized on its investments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and no change in positions 
this is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
value at risk enron has performed an entity wide value at risk analysis of virtually all of enron s financial assets and liabilities 
enron utilizes value at risk in its daily business to evaluate  measure and manage its overall risk exposure 
value at risk incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of enron s investments  including commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and associated volatilities  as well as correlation within and across these variables 
enron s methodology includes the use of delta gamma approximations for option positions and relies to a certain extent on historical correlations across commodity groups 
enron estimates value at risk commodity  interest rate and foreign exchange exposures using a model based on monte carlo simulation of delta gamma positions which captures a significant portion of the exposure related to option positions 
the value at risk for equity exposure discussed above is based on jp morgan s riskmetricst approach utilizing historical estimates of volatility and correlation 
both value at risk methods utilize a one day holding period and a confidence level 
cross commodity correlations are used as appropriate 
the use of value at risk models allows management to aggregate risks across the company  compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk 
because of the inherent limitations to value at risk  including the use of delta gamma approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period and reliance on historical data to calibrate the models  enron relies on value at risk as only one component in its risk control process 
in addition to using value at risk measures  enron performs regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of sudden market moves on the value of its portfolios 
the results of the stress testing  along with the professional judgment of experienced business and risk managers  are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and capture additional market related risks  including volatility  liquidity and event  concentration and correlation risks 
the following table illustrates the value at risk for each component of market risk december  year ended december  high low in millions average a valuation a valuation a trading market risk commodity price b interest rate foreign currency exchange rate equity non trading market risk c commodity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate equity a the average values presents a twelve month average of the month end values 
the high and low valuations for each market risk component represent the highest and lowest month end value during b in late june and early july  significant price swings in the us power markets caused enron s value at risk to increase significantly for a period of less than a month before returning to normal levels 
c includes only the risk related to the financial instruments that serve as hedges and does not include the related underlying hedged item 
accounting policies accounting policies for price risk management and hedging activities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
information regarding forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of although enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries  the ability of enron to penetrate new retail natural gas and electricity markets in the united states and europe  the timing and extent of deregulation of energy markets in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions  other regulatory developments in the united states and in foreign countries  including tax legislation and regulations  the extent of efforts by governments to privatize natural gas and electric utilities and other industries  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil  natural gas  electricity  foreign currency and interest rates  the extent of eog s success in acquiring oil and gas properties and in discovering  developing  producing and marketing reserves  the timing and success of enron s efforts to develop international power  pipeline  water and other infrastructure projects  the ability of counterparties to financial risk management instruments and other contracts with enron to meet their financial commitments to enron  enron s success in implementing its year plan  the effectiveness of enron s year plan  and the year readiness of outside entities  and enron s ability to access the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements  which will depend on general market conditions and enron s ability to maintain or increase the credit ratings for its unsecured senior long term debt obligations
