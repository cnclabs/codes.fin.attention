year issue management of the trust is well aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the potential problems associated with computer systems that may not be able to distinguish the year from the year  typically referred to as the year issue 
the trust does not own or use any information technology directly  because all services necessary to conduct the day to day operations of the trust are performed by aegon usa realty advisors  inc and its affiliates the advisor 
nevertheless  the trust could be adversely affected if computer systems  as well as certain embedded technology  used by the advisor  tenants  vendors  financial institutions and other third parties do not properly process and calculate date related information and data from and after january  the most significant risks associated with year issues that could negatively impact the trust include failure of tenants to pay rent  failure by the trust to pay its own obligations  failure of various building systems at the trust s real estate properties  failure of any and all third parties to provide services and failure of any and all information  accounting and recordkeeping systems or processes 
the reasons for such failures could range from a simple inability to process electronic information in a timely manner to a total business failure somehow related to  or the result of  the year issue 
the advisor has developed plans to modify  upgrade and or replace portions of its information technology to ensure that its computer systems will function properly in the year and thereafter  and is in process of obtaining reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the trust s other major service providers 
as of december   substantially all of the advisor s mission critical systems were year compliant 
the advisor will continue conducting revalidation testing of its systems throughout  including the development  review  and revision of business resumption and continuity plans 
the trust is not expected to incur any direct costs associated with year issues 
based on these efforts to date  management of the trust is not aware of any consequence of the year issue that it believes would have a material effect on the trust s business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that these efforts will be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the trust
