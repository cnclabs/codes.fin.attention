item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company s results of operations over the three year period ended december  reflect its continued shift toward anatomic pathology testing 
the acquisition of prl in february offset the impact of volume mix shifts during toward lower margin services  as well as reimbursement decreases which occurred throughout the reduced profit impact of these revenue factors was partially offset through cost savings in selling  general  administrative and other operating expenses  principally in the early part of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as their year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  issue bills  or engage in similar normal business activities 
while the company believes the remedial measures necessary to address its internal year issues are not material and will require minimal resources to resolve  it has determined that certain actions are necessary 
it has developed a plan to mitigate its year issues  which involves four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all material systems that could be affected by the year issue  and has identified specific systems requiring further action 
currently  of the company s software has been remediated  unit tested  and implemented 
substantial progress has been made with respect to personal computers  mainframes  servers and laboratory instrumentation 
the company expects all of its computer hardware to be year compliant by the end of the second half of the company will utilize internal resources to reprogram  or replace  test  and implement the software for year modifications 
management anticipates that its total year project costs will be less than  the company continues to query its important customers  suppliers and vendors to assess their year readiness 
as to customers  the most significant exposure is that associated with the federal government s medicare and medicaid programs and with major insurance companies 
these customers in aggregate represent a material portion of the company s revenues and corresponding cash flow 
as to suppliers and vendors  the most significant exposure is that associated with air transportation substantially all specimens are flown in overnight and the resulting reports overnighted back to the customer and laboratory supplies 
to date  the company is not aware of any problems that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that these customers  suppliers and vendors will be year compliant 
the inability of those parties to complete their year resolution process could materially impact the company 
as discussed above  the company is unaware of any year issues related to air transportation 
accordingly  the company has not developed a contingency plan in the event its vendors for air transportation are not year compliant 
the company will strive to maintain liquidity  through its credit line and cash position  to mitigate any cash flow risks associated with the aforementioned year exposures 
the company s plans to complete year modification are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
estimates regarding the status of remediation and the expected completion dates are based on hours expended to date compared to total expected hours 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel training in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
if the company s modifications and replacements are not made on a complete or timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
results of operations o net revenues net revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing annual increases of and  respectively 
anatomic pathology net revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  increases of and  respectively 
the revenue growth reflects increased penetration in the anatomic pathology area  including the impact of the prl acquisition in february  offset by pricing reductions 
clinical chemistry net revenues decreased over the three year period  from million in to million in and million in  decreases of and  respectively 
these decreases reflect the company s shifting emphasis toward anatomic pathology  and are the result of both volume and pricing reductions  the latter reflecting medicare reimbursement pressures 
o cost of sales cost of sales  which consists primarily of laboratory payroll and supplies  logistics and facility costs  increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales totaled  and in  and  respectively 
the increased percentages of revenue represented by cost of sales largely reflects the impact of a mix shift toward certain lower margin services  the aforementioned price decreases  and the integration of prl 
o gross profit gross profit totaled million in versus million in and million in  while gross profit margins were  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit and margins reflect the factors discussed above under cost of sales 
also  the increase in anatomic pathology sales as a percentage of total sales results in higher average unit pricing with lower gross margin percentages  due to the higher costs associated with providing these services 
the clinical laboratory industry  which includes both clinical chemistry and anatomic pathology  has seen steady and continuing downward pressure on prices exerted by both government and private third party payers 
payment for services such as those provided by the company is and will likely continue to be affected by periodic reevaluations made by payers concerning which services to reimburse or cease reimbursing  and over time congress has reduced the national cap on medicare laboratory fee schedules under which the company s clinical chemistry services are reimbursed to of the national median 
the president s fiscal year budget proposes to reduce this cap even further to of the national median 
in addition  legislation freezes fee schedule payments for the period 
with respect to the company s anatomic pathology services  which are not reimbursed under the medicare laboratory fee schedules  the medicare fees also generally declined with the implementation of the resource based relative value scale rbrvs system which went into effect in and was fully phased in by the end of in  there was an overall decrease of in payments for pathology services due to a five year review of the work value component and a decrease in the conversion factor applicable to pathology services  plus an additional decrease in connecticut  where the company s primary operations are located  because of the health care financing administration s hcfa reduction in the number of different payment localities recognized for rbrvs purposes 
on november   hcfa published its final medicare physician fee schedule regulation  which became effective on january  this regulation decreased the conversion factor by in it also recalculated physician practice expenses  a key component of the rbrvs  to reflect resource consumption rather than historical charge data 
the resulting new practice expense values will be phased in over the period to while the actual impact on the company s medicare pathology revenues will depend on the mix of pathology services furnished  hcfa estimates that the new system will decrease the medicare revenue for pathologists once it is fully phased in at the end of the four year period 
overall  these fee schedule changes likely will continue to have a negative effect on the company s average unit price 
the company estimates that the adverse impact on revenues in will not be material  however 
the balanced budget act of bba contains measures to establish market oriented purchasing for medicare  including prospective payment systems pps for outpatient hospital services  home health care  and nursing home care 
of these systems  only the skilled nursing facility snf pps has been implemented 
since the company does only minimal clinical laboratory testing for snf patients  this change is not expected to materially affect the company s business 
the bba also directs the secretary of the department of health and human services to implement a pps for hospital outpatient services by january  because of year computer problems  however  hcfa has asserted that it cannot implement the outpatient pps until april   at the earliest 
on september   hcfa published a proposed outpatient pps rule that would carve out clinical laboratory services from the outpatient pps rates  but would include the technical component of surgical pathology services 
the outpatient pps could affect the company s revenues for these surgical pathology services depending on the precise details of how and when the pps is implemented 
other potential changes in government and third party payer reimbursement  resulting from federal  state or local legislation  the impact of managed care  competitive bidding  or other market pressures  are also likely to continue the downward pressure on prices and make the market for clinical laboratory services more competitive  which could in turn have a material adverse impact on the company s gross profits 
o selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in  after increasing slightly over the million incurred in as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased significantly over the three year period from in to in  reflecting the operating leverage resulting from the prl acquisition and general revenue growth  lower marketing expenses in  and lower selling expenses in the early part of due to changes in the sales force 
these were offset somewhat by increased spending corresponding to an increase in personnel in the billing department 
o research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the higher expense in reflects the costs associated with launching the anatomic pathology testing services  including the cost of building the company s database 
the reduction in reflects the completion of this launch  and the further reduction in partially reflects the evolution of certain developmental test costs from r d into cost of sales as those tests have been brought to market and reimbursement rates are currently being established 
o income from operations income from operations decreased to million in  from million in and million in  reflecting the factors discussed above 
the relatively modest drop in year to date operating income  despite the larger drop in gross profit  partially reflects cost control initiatives implemented in anticipation of reimbursement reductions 
o net interest income net interest income grew to  in from  in and  in this reflects the increased cash and cash equivalent position of the company over the period  partially resulting from cash generated by operations 
o provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million in  from million in and million in  while the effective tax rate was  and  respectively 
o net income net income decreased to million  from million in and million in basic earnings per share decreased to per share in  from per share in and per share in diluted earnings per share decreased to per share in  from per share in and per share in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total cash and cash equivalents of million  substantially all of which was invested in a fund holding us treasury securities with maturities of less than three months 
working capital was million  million and million  as of december   and  respectively and the current ratios were  and  respectively 
accounts receivable net of allowances totaled million at both december  and versus as of december   representing approximately days  days and days of average sales  respectively 
capital expenditures for  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
expenditures in were primarily related to information systems enhancements  both medical and billing 
in addition   was expended in toward the acquisition of prl 
effective february   the company entered into a three year  million line of credit agreement with a bank 
the agreement includes various provisions regarding borrowings under the facility  including those related to financial covenants 
to date  there have been no amounts drawn down under this line 
as of december   the company holds  shares of common stock in treasury at a cost of approximately million 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized to repurchase up to an additional million shares of the company s common stock  on the open market or in a private transaction  and that the total expenditures for share repurchases be limited to an additional million  for a total authorization of approximately million shares and million in total expenditures 
the remaining authorized repurchases as of december  is approximately million shares and million in total expenditures 
on january   the company signed a letter of intent to acquire substantially all the assets of kyto meridien diagnostics  llc  an outpatient ob gyn laboratory with locations in woodbury and new city  new york 
the company is in the process of conducting due diligence and  subject to the result of this process  expects to close the acquisition in the second quarter of the company plans to finance the acquisition through a combination of available cash and drawdowns of the aforementioned credit line  as well as issuance of common stock  newly issued or treasury shares 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalents are adequate to fund the company s operations for the foreseeable future
