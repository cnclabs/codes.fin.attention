general through three wholly owned subsidiaries  we currently operate schools in states offering a range of graduate  undergraduate and non degree certificate or diploma programs primarily in the fields of information technology  healthcare and business to more than  students 
we are organized into a university degree division and an associate degree division 
the university degree division offers primarily doctorate  master and bachelor degrees through colorado tech and huron university 
the associate degree division offers associate degrees and diplomas or certificates through sanford brown and uds 
the revenues generated from these subsidiaries primarily consist of tuition and fees paid by students 
the majority of students rely on funds received from title iv programs to pay for a substantial portion of their tuition 
accordingly  a majority of our revenues are indirectly derived from title iv programs 
historically  our revenues have increased primarily as a result of the expansion of program offerings and the opening or acquisition of campuses 
at uds  the expansion of program offerings generated an increase in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal at colorado tech  the expansion of program offerings  opening of a campus  and the acquisition of huron university generated an increase in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal instructional and educational support consists primarily of costs related to the educational activity of our schools 
instructional and educational support includes faculty compensation  administrative salaries for departments that provide services directly to the students  occupancy costs  costs of books sold  and depreciation and amortization of equipment costs and leasehold improvements 
selling and promotional expenses consist primarily of advertising costs  production costs of marketing materials  and salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in student recruitment  admissions  and promotional functions 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  depreciation  bad debt  amortization of intangibles  and other related costs for departments that do not provide direct services to students

as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due to our ability to increase revenues at a greater rate than the rate of increase in administrative operating costs 
we periodically perform an analysis of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of current and expected operating results 
as of march   we determined that a  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary  which resulted in a decrease in the valuation allowance of  in fiscal we reported net income of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in net income in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in operating income of million generated from the associate degree division and a decrease in operating losses of million sustained by the university degree division 
the increase in operating income in the associate degree division was due to an increase in revenues of million resulting from increased student enrollment and an increased earning rate 
the decrease in the operating loss sustained by the university degree division was due to an increase in revenues of million resulting from an increase in student enrollment

the operating losses sustained by these two campuses  which were added during fiscal  increased by million in fiscal to million 
seasonality we experience seasonality in our quarterly results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
new enrollment in our schools tends to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters because these quarters cover periods traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
costs are generally not significantly affected by the seasonal factors on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  quarterly variations in net revenues will result in fluctuations in income from operations on a quarterly basis 
year issue we have implemented a process for identifying  prioritizing and modifying or replacing certain computer and other systems and programs that may be affected by the year issue 
we are also monitoring the adequacy of the manner in which certain third parties and third party vendors of systems are attempting to address the year issue 
we have substantially completed an assessment of our computer systems and believe that with the modifications made to existing software and the conversions made to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems to our information systems 
we expect to complete testing of the year issues by mid to late  which would be prior to any anticipated impact on our operating systems 
we are highly dependent on student funding provided through title iv programs 
processing of student applications for this funding and actual disbursement of a significant portion of these funds are accomplished through the department of education s computer systems 
should the department of education experience year related disruptions  it could result in interruption of funding for our students 
any prolonged interruption would have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in april  the department of education announced that all of its data systems  including its mission critical systems  are year compliant 
based on the assessment performed to date  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
while we believe our process is designed to be successful  because of the complexity of the year issue  and the interdependence of organizations using computer systems  it is possible that our efforts or those of third parties with whom we interact  will not be successful or satisfactorily completed in a timely fashion 
based on the modifications and conversions of software made to date and the assessment of embedded devices that have been identified at our facilities to date  we do not believe that contingency planning is warranted at this time 
the assessment of outside third parties is underway  and the results of this assessment  when completed  may reveal the need for contingency planning at a later date 
we will regularly evaluate the need for contingency planning based on the progress and findings of the year project 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our working capital totaled million at march    million at march  and million at march  net cash of million was provided by operating activities in fiscal  an increase in cash provided of million from fiscal and an increase of million from fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in net income of million and million from fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash of million was used for investing activities in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal and a decrease of million from fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures from million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  to million in fiscal we estimate that the capital expenditures expected to be incurred during fiscal will approximate million 
these anticipated capital expenditures primarily relate to the costs associated with the relocation and upgrade of campus facilities and the acquisition and upgrade of equipment for the schools 
funds required to finance such capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from additional capital lease obligations and from funds generated from operations 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in fiscal  an increase in cash used of million and million from fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal was due to an increase in the repayment of debt and due to proceeds received from a private placement in fiscal of  shares of our common stock to an unaffiliated institutional investor for million 
we had a million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature on april  at march   we had million outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding of  which reduced the amount available for borrowing 
the amounts borrowed under this facility in fiscal were primarily used for operations and capital expenditures 
at march   we had letters of credit outstanding of  including the  of letters of credit under the credit facility 
on april   we extended the maturity date on the credit facility to july  on may   we entered into an million line of credit with a new lender  which expires on june   and repaid the outstanding balance due under the old credit facility with borrowings under the new line of credit 
of the million line of credit   is reserved and thus not available for borrowing for draws which may be made under the outstanding letters of credit 
our primary source of operating liquidity is the cash received from payments of tuition and fees 
most students attending our schools receive some form of financial aid under title iv programs 
uds  sanford brown and colorado tech receive approximately  and of their funding  respectively  from the title iv programs 
disbursements under each program are subject to disallowance and repayment by the schools 
we believe that with our working capital  our cash flow from operations  our increased working capital facilities and our expected increased financings under capital lease obligations to fund capital expenditures  we will have adequate resources to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk related to our variable rate line of credit as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   our variable rate long term debt had a carrying value of million 
the fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value because the variable rates approximate market rates 
a increase in the period end interest rate would not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition
