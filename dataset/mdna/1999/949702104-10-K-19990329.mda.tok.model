item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of high quality polyester products  including fortrel r brand polyester textile fibers  polyester fibers made from recycled raw materials and permaclear r brand pet packaging resins 
in  the company had annual capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of fiber and million pounds of resins worldwide at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
the company is also the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in its manufacturing operations 
the company plans to substantially increase its polyester fiber and pet resins production capacity through the construction of its new  state of the art pearl river plant in mississippi 
this facility commenced operation of a pet resin production line in january this was the first of three production lines scheduled to commence operation in see recent developments above and outlook below 
the fibers group produces fortrel r textile fibers  which currently represent approximately of the company s fiber production 
these fibers are used in apparel and home furnishings and are produced from two chemical raw materials  pta and meg 
the other of fiber production  primarily fiberfill and carpet fibers  is manufactured by the rpg from recycled raw materials  including postindustrial fiber  resin and film materials and postconsumer pet soft drink bottles 
the company s pet resins  produced by the ppg from pta and meg  are primarily used in the manufacture of clear plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the company s markets are highly competitive 
it competes in these markets primarily on the basis of product quality  customer service  brand identity and price 
it believes it is the second largest polyester staple and fourth largest poy producer in the united states and the fourth largest pet resins producer in north america 
several of the company s competitors are substantially larger than the company and have substantially greater economic resources 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical  as it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
since late  the far east has been experiencing a significant economic and financial crisis 
this crisis has led to higher imports of polyester fiber  fabric and apparel  resulting in fiber price pressure in the united states and europe  which has adversely affected profitability 
global pet resins demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
sales for pet resins  primarily for soft drink bottles and other beverages  may be influenced by weather demand 
the company s profitability is primarily determined by its raw material margins the difference between reduced selling prices and raw material costs 
both fiber and resin raw material margins experience increases or decreases primarily based on selling price and raw material cost changes  which stem from supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given the company s substantial unit volumes  the impact of selling price and raw material cost changes are significant 
raw material margins for both fibers and resins are currently at levels among the lowest in recent history  primarily due to reductions in selling prices which have occurred over the last few years 
see results of operations compared to below for explanation of selling price changes 
the net cost of the company s chemical raw materials  pta and meg  decreased in  primarily due to worldwide oversupply 
lower chemical costs have partially offset lower selling prices 
however  costs of domestic recycled raw materials  which are also dependent upon worldwide supply and demand  increased in compared to worldwide supply of fibers and resins continues to undergo significant expansion 
supply  demand  prices and raw material costs  each may be affected by global economic and market conditions  export activity  and the prices of competing materials 
recent and contemplated changes in ownership of certain fiber and resin competitors have had a destabilizing influence in the company s markets 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan to consolidate and lower the overall operating costs of the business units in the rpg 
in connection with this plan  the company will close operations of a leased manufacturing facility in new jersey and a sales office in england in the first quarter of the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in its fourth quarter of  primarily including a million write off of equipment and other assets to be sold or scrapped  a million accrual for the removal and dismantling of the equipment and restoration of the leased facility to its original state  and a million accrual for termination benefits of approximately employees 
there were no charges against the accruals during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and enhance the overall competitiveness of its european operations 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately million during its second quarter of this consisted of restructuring costs of approximately million  less a previously recorded million charge to cost of goods sold to provide for inventory losses related to the company s take or pay supply arrangement entered into as part of the acquisition of its netherlands based pet resins business in approximately million of the restructuring charge was an accrual for estimated costs to modify certain supply and service agreements at the company s netherlands based pet resins business 
this included the modification of its take or pay supply contract that previously required the company to purchase million pounds of pet resin on a declining basis during the period from to  to reduce the number of pounds to be purchased to an immaterial amount 
the restructuring accrual also included approximately million of termination benefits for employees at its recycled fiber operation in ireland and the pet resins business 
the restructuring is expected to be completed during see results of operations compared to below for benefits derived from the restructuring 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for details of charges to the reserves since the plan was adopted 
loss on fixed rate treasury lock commitment in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a one time pre tax charge of million on the termination of a fixed rate financial instrument 
this instrument was designed to provide a specified fixed year interest rate on a planned issuance of million of public fixed rate debt 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided more favorable financing was available and postponed its plan for public debt issuance and terminated the financial instrument 
results of operations compared to total net sales for declined to million from billion in this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in worldwide polyester fiber selling prices  as the crisis in the far east exerted intense price pressure on worldwide markets  the loss of sales of creative forming  inc cfi  which was sold in december  and a reduction in pet resin unit volumes in europe due to the modification of a take or pay supply contract in net sales for the fibers group decreased to million in from million in primarily due to an decline in the average selling price per pound of polyester fiber in compared to in addition  polyester fiber unit volumes declined in compared to net sales for the rpg decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of lower polyester fiber average selling prices  which declined in compared to  which was partially offset by a increase in unit volume 
in addition  in  the rpg experienced a decline in net sales at other divisions 
sales for the ppg decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the divestiture of cfi  which had sales of million in  and a decrease in net sales in the pet resins business in europe  stemming from lower unit volumes in due to the modification of a take or pay supply contract in this decrease offset a increase in us pet resin unit volumes in compared to cost of sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower worldwide chemical raw material costs 
as a percentage of sales  however  cost of sales increased to in from in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment totaling million unfavorably impacted the cost of sales for the fibers group and ppg in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales for the fibers group increased in from  primarily due to lower fiber selling prices and lower production volumes  which were partially offset by lower chemical costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the rpg increased in compared to primarily due to higher us recycled raw material costs and lower worldwide fiber selling prices 
the company experienced lower production costs in its european operations in compared to as a result of the aforementioned restructuring plan 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the ppg decreased in from  primarily due to lower chemical raw material costs  which more than offset lower selling prices 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit for the declined to million in from million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of cfi and reduced costs at the company s european operations as a result of the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of see results of operations compared to below 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a restructuring plan to consolidate and lower the overall operating costs of its recycling business 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in see restructuring charges above 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income declined to million in compared to million in interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is due to higher interest capitalization resulting from the company s ongoing capital investment program 
see outlook below for information with respect to the impact on interest expense expected in from the startup of the pearl river plant 
the effective income tax rate was for compared to in the rate decreased primarily as a result of increased earnings at the company s irish recycled fiber operation  which is subject to significantly lower tax rates than the us operations  and the reduction in foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit had been provided 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in compared to million  or per diluted share  in excluding the inventory adjustment  restructuring charges and loss on the fixed rate financial instrument  net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in compared to earnings exclusive of one time charges of million  or per diluted share 
results of operations compared to net sales for remained unchanged as compared to at billion primarily as a result of higher sales volumes offsetting lower selling prices 
sales for the fibers group decreased to million in from million in due to significantly lower polyester fiber selling prices which more than offset slightly higher sales volumes 
sales for the rpg increased to million in from million in due to increased polyester fiber sales volumes and higher sales in other divisions which offset worldwide declines in polyester fiber selling prices 
sales volumes in were negatively impacted by a week strike at the company s irish fiber operation  which kept the facility closed from mid july through early october 
despite substantially higher domestic sales volumes  sales for the ppg increased only slightly to million in from in as a result of significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices 
in the second quarter of  the company commenced operation of an additional million pounds per year pet resins production line at its darlington  sc plant 
the cost of sales decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  the cost of sales was in compared to in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily the result of higher unit volumes and lower costs in the rpg  which more than offset lower worldwide fiber and resin selling prices 
cost of sales in was negatively impacted by a week strike at the company s irish fiber operation and a charge of million to establish an inventory reserve resulting from large declines in raw material costs 
for the fibers group  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased in from  primarily due to significantly lower polyester fiber selling prices  which more than offset lower chemical raw material and manufacturing costs 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales for the rpg declined in from due to increased sales volumes at the company s irish fiber operation  as a result of the period being negatively impacted by the aforementioned strike 
also benefiting the rpg s cost of sales in were substantially lower recycled raw material costs and higher unit sales volumes in the domestic fibers business and lower costs at other divisions 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the ppg increased in from primarily due to significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices  which more than offset higher domestic unit sales volumes resulting from the aforementioned capacity expansion and lower chemical raw material costs 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit for increased to million from million in the gross profit margin in was compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales 
the decrease is due to reduced costs at the company s european operations resulting from the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of see restructuring charges above as well as the company s continued efforts to reduce overall spending 
during the second quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and enhance the overall competitiveness of its european operations  resulting in a pretax charge of approximately million 
see restructuring charges above 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income was million in  or million excluding the restructuring charge  compared to million in net interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense was due principally to higher interest capitalization resulting from the company s ongoing capacity expansion program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pretax loss of million which decreased net earnings by million  or per diluted share 
the loss is comprised of two parts a loss on the sale of a subsidiary and a gain from an insurance reimbursement related to a warehouse fire at the company s irish fiber operation in july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective income tax rate was in compared to in the rate decreased primarily as a result of increased earnings at the company s irish fiber operation  which is subject to significantly lower tax rates than the us operations  and the reduction in foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit had been provided 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings for were million  or per diluted share 
excluding the one time charges  net earnings for were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in outlook the us and european fiber markets have been severely impacted by the far eastern economic crisis and the resultant increase in imports of fiber  yarn  fabric and apparel from that region 
in the united states  high levels of asian imports are still present throughout the textile chain 
as a result  demand for polyester fiber remains weak  with higher inventory levels  excess capacity and downward selling price pressure continuing to affect domestic fiber producers 
ongoing selling price pressure may further erode fiber profit margins  which ended at the lowest levels of the year 
demand for pet packaging resins remains relatively strong 
the company believes continued growing demand may improve both selling prices and profit margins in the company is nearing completion of construction of its pearl river plant in mississippi 
the first of two million pound resin production lines at this facility came on line in january the second resin line is scheduled to commence operation in the second quarter of as a result  resin unit volumes are expected to increase significantly in the plant s million pound fiber production line is scheduled to commence operation later in in line with the current start up plan  the company plans to perform previously delayed maintenance on various production lines at other fiber facilities in as a result  fiber volumes are initially expected to increase only modestly 
the start up of the pearl river plant and other worldwide fiber and resins capacity expansions may result in downward pressure on selling prices and profit margins 
in  the company s results of operations will also be impacted by certain increased expenses associated with the start up of the pearl river plant 
interest costs  previously capitalized during the construction of the facility  will be expensed as incurred 
the company will also begin depreciating the facility in phases as each production line commences operation 
the estimated impact of the adoption of sop on the results of operations will be an after tax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  start up costs to be incurred and expensed in are estimated to be in a range of million to million 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings from continuing operations are expected to be adversely affected during certain of the company s major competitors have engaged in and are contemplating changes in the ownership and management of their businesses 
these activities have had and may continue to have a destabilizing influence on the company s markets 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
the company takes a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to its manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
the company has identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations as well as to support planned future expansion 
the majority of the identified situations are found at the company s largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
the company s policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company currently estimates its future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  the company has accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these accruals represent management s best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
the company believes that it is entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during  and  net expenses associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the measurement of liability is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information which becomes available 
the company believes it is either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or is operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

year computer issue overview the year computer issue is the result of computer programs being written using only two digits rather than four to refer to a year 
if uncorrected  these computer programs may not be able to distinguish between the years and and may fail to operate or may produce unpredictable results 
wellman has been addressing the year computer issue within its information technology and non information technology systems through a company wide year project 
non information technology systems typically include embedded technology such as computer chips within manufacturing equipment and building security systems 
the company s year project formally commenced in december and is proceeding on schedule 
the company anticipates completing its year project no later than june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
year project the company organized its year project into five broad phases development of a company wide inventory of both information technology and embedded systems  company wide assessment  with focus on vital and critical items  which was completed in february  renovation remediation  which is targeted for completion by june   validation and testing  which is targeted for completion by june   and implementation 
when a system passes the company s established test criteria  it is certified as year ready and cleared for implementation 
the company focuses on the following vital and critical items in its remediation efforts a information systems portfolio  b embedded systems  c purchasing and trading partners  d end user owned applications  and e network and personal computers 
a information systems portfolio these have been divided into two categories corporate systems and manufacturing systems 
corporate systems  which consist largely of third party applications and  to a lesser degree  in house written applications  include  but are not limited to  human resources payroll  accounts payable  general ledger  order fulfillment shipping  receiving  and invoicing  electronic data interchange edi  and phone voice mail 
the company believes all of the vital and critical corporate systems are year ready 
manufacturing systems are located at and support manufacturing processes at company facilities 
the company is currently remediating three manufacturing systems  which are approximately complete  with target completions in the second quarter of the remaining systems that were classified by the company as vital and critical have been remediated and are either currently being tested or are scheduled for testing with expected completion dates no later than june  b embedded systems these include items such as programmed logic controllers  drives  and process controllers 
based on its assessment  the company believes that approximately of its embedded systems have no date related issues 
the remaining of the company s embedded systems are in the process of being tested or remediated 
of the  the company has completed its testing of approximately  and less than of these tested required remediation 
c purchasing and trading partners the company has surveyed all of its vital and critical trading partners suppliers and customers concerning their year efforts in general 
edi trading partners have been surveyed specifically with regards to the compliance of their software 
the company has received written responses to their surveys but is aware that these written responses may not accurately represent the year compliance status of a trading partner 
certain targeted suppliers are being interviewed personally 
as part of this project  contracts are being reviewed and rewritten where necessary to include year clauses 
d end user owned applications there are various end user written desktop applications throughout the company s locations 
the vast majority of these applications are not vital and critical to the business 
of those that are vital and critical to operations  the company believes that the majority have no year date issues 
for those that are vital and critical with date issues  a desktop remediation tool has been selected and is being used as needed 
e network and personal computers approximately of the company s vital and critical local area network servers and personal computers are believed to be year ready 
the remainder are being replaced with compliant hardware 
costs the total cost of the company s year project is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
risks due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in the year computer issue  the company cannot ensure  despite its ongoing communications with its trading partners  that its most important suppliers and customers will be year compliant on time 
the failure of critical suppliers or customers to timely correct their year computer problems could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition  even resulting in interruption of normal business operations if a critical supplier is unable to meet contractual obligations in a timely way 
the company is in the process of preparing  but has not completed  contingency plans which will involve  among other actions  managing inventories and adjusting staffing strategies 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans during the second quarter of based on current plans and efforts to date  the company does not anticipate that the year issue will have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition 
however  the above expectations are subject to uncertainties 
for example  if the company is unsuccessful in identifying or remediating all year problems in its critical operations  or if it is affected by the inability of suppliers or major customers to continue operations due to such a problem  then the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially impacted 
forward looking statements contained in this year computer issue section should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties beginning on page transition to the euro although the euro was successfully introduced on january   the legacy currencies of those countries participating will continue to be used as legal tender through january  thereafter  the legacy currencies will be cancelled and euro bills and coins will be used in the eleven participating countries 
transition to the euro creates a number of issues for the company 
business issues that must be addressed include product pricing policies and ensuring the continuity of business and financial contracts 
finance and accounting issues include the conversion of accounting systems  statutory records  tax books and payroll systems to the euro  as well as conversion of bank accounts and other treasury and cash management activities 
the company continues to address these transition issues and does not expect the transition to the euro to have a significant effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
at wil  systems are compatible with the euro  and beginning in  the subsidiary will prepare its financial statements in euros 
the company has not yet set conversion dates for its pet resins europe accounting systems  statutory reporting and tax books  but will do so in in conjunction with its efforts to be year compliant 
capital resources and liquidity the company s overall cash needs for were provided from operations and long term borrowings 
net cash provided by operations was million for compared to million for the decrease in cash from operations was primarily the result of lower net income as discussed above in results of operations compared to and increased inventory levels in preparation for the start up of the company s pearl river plant 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to million in capital spending amounted to million in and million in  reflecting the company s ongoing capital investment program 
the major portion of the company s ongoing capital investment program is the construction of its pearl river plant in mississippi and  to a lesser extent  a new production line in the engineering resins business 
the total capitalized cost of the facility is estimated to range between and million 
this facility is scheduled to be operational in three phases  the first of which began in january the company expects capital expenditures to approximate to million in net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in compared to million in net borrowings amounted to million in compared to million in as a result of the company s ongoing capital investment program 
the company s financing agreements contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
certain subsidiaries have guaranteed substantially all of the company s indebtedness for borrowed money 
the financial resources available to the company at december  include million under its million revolving credit facility  unused short term uncommitted lines of credit aggregating approximately million  and internally generated funds 
at december  the company could only borrow an additional million without amending the terms of its revolving credit facility 
the company believes these financial resources and other credit arrangements will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends

forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions that a number of important factors could cause actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
such statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  demand and competition for polyester fiber and pet resins  availability and cost of raw materials  levels of production capacity and announced changes thereto  changes in financial markets  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  work stoppages  natural disasters  us  european  far eastern and global economic conditions and changes in laws and regulations  prices of competing products  and the company s ability to complete expansions and other capital projects on time and budget and to maintain the operations of its existing production facilities 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes which could adversely affect its operating results in one or more fiscal quarters 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which the company is subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties which may be more significant to the company 
impact of economic conditions capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply  is a critical factor affecting the company s financial performance 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical because it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fiber and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions 
worldwide supply is expanding for both fiber and resins 
any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce profitability 
a material change in demand  supply or in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
impact of far eastern financial crisis beginning in the fourth quarter of  the far eastern economies have been experiencing a significant economic and financial crisis 
this crisis has reduced demand in the far east for polyester fiber and textile products and led to a significant increase in low priced us imports of these products  which has adversely affected the company s results of operations and may continue to do so 
dependency on availability of raw materials the company s operations are substantially dependent on the availability of its two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
the company currently relies on a single source for the domestic supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any of such sources  of a disruption in their business or failure to meet the company s product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that precautions taken by the company would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
construction program the company is currently constructing a new pet resins and polyester fiber production facility in mississippi at a total estimated capitalized cost to range between and million 
the facility commenced operation of a pet resin production line at this facility in january when completed  the facility will have an initial annual capacity of approximately million pounds of pet packaging resins and million pounds of polyester fiber 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to commence operations of the remaining two production lines as scheduled  that it will not encounter significant disruptions in its operations  that the facility will operate as effectively as expected  or that the company will be able to sell at acceptable prices the added volumes from this facility 
environmental matters actual costs to be incurred for identified environmental situations in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies 
year as part of the company s procedures relating to the year see year computer issue above  the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the costs of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company also utilizes a derivative financial instrument to manage its exposure to compensation expense under a supplemental employee retirement plan serp 
for additional discussion of the company s use of such instruments  see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because the company s obligations under the revolving credit loan facility  competitive bid loans and uncommitted lines of credit bear interest at floating rates  the company s earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
however  due to its purchase of interest rate swaps  the effect of interest rate changes are limited 
a decrease in market interest rates from december  that affect the company s financial instruments would reduce income before income taxes by approximately million  and reduce cash flow from operations by million 
the potential decrease in fair value of all financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical shift in interest rate from december  would be approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
foreign currency risk the company uses foreign currency debt and derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments primarily denominated in dutch guilders and irish punts are specifically used to reduce the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments for its pet resins business in the netherlands  to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations relative to fixed asset purchase commitments  and to hedge certain accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december   would decline by approximately million 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in fair value of the company s underlying exposure 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices 
equity risk the company also uses an equity linked investment to hedge its exposure to compensation expense to a serp 
this equity linked investment  on which the value fluctuates based on the market price of the company s stock  is marked to market  and gains or losses are recognized as an offset to compensation expense related to the serp 
a decrease in the market value of the company s stock would not materially affect the fair value of the equity linked investment
