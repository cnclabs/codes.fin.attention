item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general medford co operative bank the bank completed its conversion from a mutual to a stock institution and was simultaneously acquired by mystic financial  inc mystic or the company on january  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included within this report 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains safe harbor provisions regarding forward looking statements 
when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipates  contemplates  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
those risks and uncertainties include changes in interest rates generally and changes in real estate values and other economic conditions in eastern massachusetts  the bank s principal market area 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the business of the bank consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using these funds to originate various types of loans primarily in eastern middlesex county  massachusetts  including mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences  commercial loans secured by general business assets  commercial real estate loans secured by commercial property  and to invest in us government and federal agency and other securities 
to a lesser extent  the bank engages in various forms of consumer and home equity lending 
the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio and its cost of funds  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and on borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlb 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of other noninterest income and operating expenses 
other income consists primarily of service fees  loan servicing and other loan fees and gains on sales of investment securities 
operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits  occupancy related expenses  and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution s regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
business strategy the bank s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to financing home ownership  small business and consumer needs in its market area and providing quality service to its customers 
the bank has implemented this strategy by i monitoring the needs of customers and providing quality service  ii emphasizing consumer oriented banking by originating residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  and by offering various deposit accounts and other financial services and products  iii recently increasing its emphasis on commercial banking and lending by originating loans for small businesses and providing greater services in its commercial and commercial real estate loan department  iv maintaining high asset quality through conservative underwriting  and v producing stable earnings 
asset liability management a principal operating objective of the bank is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
since the bank s principal interest earning assets have longer terms to maturity than its primary source of funds  ie  deposit liabilities  increases in general interest rates will generally result in an increase in the bank s cost of funds before the yield on its asset portfolio adjusts upward 
the bank has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
the term interest rate sensitivity refers to those assets and liabilities which mature and reprice periodically in response to fluctuations in market rates and yields 
as noted above  one of the principal goals of the bank s asset liability program is to maintain and match the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of the asset and liability portfolios 
in order to properly manage interest rate risk  the bank s board of directors has established an asset liability management committee alco made up of members of management to monitor the difference between the bank s maturing and repricing assets and liabilities and to develop and implement strategies to decrease the negative gap between the two 
the primary responsibilities of the committee are to assess the bank s asset liability mix  recommend strategies to the board that will enhance income while managing the bank s vulnerability to changes in interest rates and report to the board the results of the strategies used 
since the early s  the bank has stressed the origination of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate home equity loans 
the bank regularly sells fixed rate loans with terms in excess of years 
since  the bank has also emphasized commercial loans with short term maturities or repricing intervals as well as commercial real estate mortgages with short term repricing intervals 
in addition  the bank has used borrowings from the fhlb to match fund the maturity or repricing interval of several larger commercial real estate mortgages 
at june   the bank s loan portfolio included million of adjustable rate one to four family mortgage loans  million of adjustable rate commercial real estate loans  million of adjustable rate or short term commercial loans  and million of adjustable rate home equity loans 
together  these loans represent of the bank s net loans at june  see business lending activities 
in the future  in managing its interest rate sensitivity  the bank intends to continue to stress the origination of adjustable rate mortgages when possible and loans with shorter maturities and the maintenance of a consistent level of short term securities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would negatively affect net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at june  which are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods shown 
in the table  investment securities held to maturity are presented at amortized cost  other interest earning assets include marketable equity securities  fhlb stock  due from co operative central bank  federal funds sold and other short term investments  fixed rate one to four family loans  adjustable rate one to four family loans  commercial real estate loans  and commercial loans do not include any amortization or prepayment amounts 
money market accounts  now accounts  regular and other deposits are shown to mature or reprice within a three month time period based on the contractual status of each type of account 
at june  over three over six months over one over three three months through six through one through three through seven over seven or less months year years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities held to maturity  investment securities available for sale  at fair value       other interest earning assets   adjustable rate one to four family loans       fixed rate one to four family loans    commercial real estate loans       commercial loans     home equity loans   consumer loans  construction loans  net    total interest earning assets        interest bearing liabilities certificates of deposit      money market accounts   now accounts   regular and other deposits   fhlb borrowings       total interest bearing liabilities        interest rate sensitivity gap        cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap        cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities ratio of cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap to total interest earning assets ratio of cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap to total assets management believes the current one year gap of negative presents a risk to the net interest income should a sustained increase occur in the current level of interest rates 
if interest rates increase  the bank s negative one year gap should cause the net interest margin to decrease 
a conservative interest rate risk gap policy provides a stable net interest income margin 
accordingly  management emphasizes a structured schedule of investment securities with greater emphasis on maturities and repricings within one year 
it is possible that the actual interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities could vary significantly from the information set forth in the table due to market and other factors 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  an interest rate increase may make it more difficult for borrowers to service their debt  thereby increasing the credit risk in the bank s loan portfolio 
average balances  interest and average yields the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s average balance sheet and reflect the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated and the average yields earned and rates paid for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average monthly balances of assets and liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
average balances are derived from daily balances 
loans on nonaccrual status are included in the average balances of loans shown in the table

operating results are also significantly affected by provisions for loan losses  other income and operating expenses 
each of these factors is significantly affected not only by the company s policies  but  to varying degrees  by general economic and competitive conditions and by policies of state and federal regulatory authorities 
comparison of financial condition at june  and june  the company s total assets amounted to million at june  compared to million at june   an increase of million or 
the increase in total assets is primarily attributable to an increase in net loans of million and an increase in investment securities of million  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash and cash equivalents was million at june  compared to million at june  cash and cash equivalents decreased at june  due to a decrease of million in federal funds sold to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in federal funds sold was caused by a decrease in the liquidity needed for a large deposit relationship with a law firm which maintains short term deposits in real estate conveyancing accounts and has significant fluctuations in its deposit account balances  particularly at month ends

the average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june   while the average cost on interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  as a result  the interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  the interest rate spread declined due to interest rates on interest earning assets falling more quickly than interest rates on interest bearing liabilities during a period of generally falling interest rates 
the company s net loans to total assets ratio increased to at june  from at june  as a result of growth in loan originations and an increase in loan portfolio retention 
provision for loan losses

liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds consist of deposits  borrowings  repayment and prepayment of loans  sales and participations of loans  maturities of investments and interest bearing deposits  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank uses its liquidity resources primarily to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund net deposit outflows  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity and to meet operating expenses 
the bank is required to maintain adequate levels of liquid assets 
this guideline  which may be varied depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank has historically maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of regulatory requirements 
the bank s liquidity ratio at june  was 
the bank began using fhlb borrowings in to augment its liquidity as its loan originations have continued to increase since a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  short term us government and federal agency obligations  and corporate bonds 
the level of these assets is dependent upon the bank s operating  investing  lending and financing activities during any given period 
the primary investing activities of the bank include origination of loans and purchase of investment securities 
during the year ended june   loan originations and purchases totaled million while purchases of investment securities and fhlb stock totaled million 
these investments were funded primarily from loan repayments and loan sales of million  investment security maturities and calls of million  net deposit increases of million  a net increase in borrowings of million 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of management 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  the bank believes it could borrow additional funds from the fhlb 
at june   the bank had borrowings of million from the fhlb 
at june   the bank had million in outstanding commitments to originate loans and unadvanced funds on lines of credit and credit card loans 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million at june  based upon historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at june   the company and the bank exceeded all of their regulatory capital requirements 
for further information regarding the company s and the bank s regulatory capital at june   see regulation federal banking regulations capital requirements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time because of inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accounting principles generally require all recognized revenue  expenses  gains and losses to be included in net income 
various fasb statements  however  require companies to report certain changes in assets and liabilities as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities 
this such item  along with net income  is a component of comprehensive income 
it is required under sfas that all items of comprehensive income are to be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
additionally  sfas requires the classification of items comprising other comprehensive income by their nature  and the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income must be displayed separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
management adopted this new disclosure requirement as of july  also  in june of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas 
sfas is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  sfas establishes standards for the way that public companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
sfas also requires companies to report information about the way that the operating segments were determined  the product and services provided by the operating segments  differences between the measurements used in reporting segment information and those used by the company in its general purpose financial statements  and changes in the measurement of segment amounts from period to period 
the company s operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company wide basis 
accordingly  all of the company s banking operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable segment 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
sfas generally provides for matching the timing of a gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of a the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or b the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
sfas was originally effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 sfas 
sfas defers the effective date of sfas to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years  beginning after june  retroactive application to prior periods is prohibited 
the bank does not generally use derivative instruments and therefore the adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
year the year problem centers on the inability of computer systems to recognize the year many existing computer programs and systems were originally programmed with six digit dates that provided only two digits to identify the calendar year in the date field  without considering the upcoming change in the century 
with the impending millennium  these programs and computers will recognize as the year rather than the year like most financial service providers  the bank and its operations may be significantly affected by the year problem due to the nature of financial information 
software  hardware  and equipment both within and outside the bank s direct control and with whom the bank electronically or operationally interfaces eg third party vendors providing data processing  information system management  maintenance of computer systems  and credit bureau information are likely to be affected 
furthermore  if computer systems are not adequately changed to identify the year  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
as a result  many calculations which rely on the date field information  such as interest  payment or due dates and other operating functions  will generate results which could be significantly misstated  and the bank could experience a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  under certain circumstances  failure to adequately addressthe year problem could adversely affect the viability of the bank s suppliers and creditors and the creditworthiness of its borrowers 
thus  if not adequately addressed  the year problem could result in a significant adverse impact on the bank s products  services and competitive condition 
in order to address the year issue and to minimize its potential adverse impact  in management began a process to identify areas that will be affected by the year problem  assess its potential impact on the operations of the bank  monitor the progress of third party software vendors in addressing the matter  test changes provided by these vendors  and develop contingency plans for any critical systems which are not effectively reprogrammed 
the bank s plan is divided into the five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  testing  and implementation 
because the bank outsources its data processing and item processing operations  a significant component of the year plan is working with external vendors to test and certify their systems as year compliant 
the bank s external vendors surveyed their programs and have corrected the applicable computer programs and replaced equipment so that the bank s information systems were year compliant at the end of this enabled the bank to devote substantial time to the testing of the upgraded systems by june  in order to comply with all applicable regulations 
the bank has completed its timetable for addressing year issues 
the company presently believes that with the modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem will be mitigated without causing a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not effective  the year problem could have an impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  monitoring and managing the year project has resulted in additional direct and indirect costs to the company and the bank 
direct costs include charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance  and costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which are not enhanced 
indirect costs principally consist of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
the company has incurred aggregate direct and indirect costs of approximately  and expects to incur an additional  of costs 
both direct and indirect costs of addressing the year problem are charged to earnings as incurred 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
the company has developed a contingency plan which would be implemented in the unforeseen event year problems occur 
the company will continue to closely monitor its year compliance plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies affecting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the alco committee is composed of members of management to monitor the difference between the company s maturing and repricing assets and liabilities and to develop and implement strategies to decrease the negative gap between the two 
the primary responsibilities of the committee are to assess the company s asset liability mix  recommend strategies to the board that will enhance income while managing the company s vulnerability to changes in interest rates and report to the board the results of the strategies used 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby affecting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling one year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to board and alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the company uses various other assumptions in its sensitivity analysis 
for investment securities  in the event of a call provision  if the interest rate is lower than the contractual rate  reinvestment is assumed at the lower rate 
for residential mortgage loans  the company uses the psa method to generate different prepayment assumptions 
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans do not include any amortization or prepayment amounts 
for money market accounts  now accounts  regular savings deposits  not all deposits within these categories are assumed to increase by the full extent of the interest rate shift based upon management s judgment as to deposit elasticity 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of june  estimated nii rate change sensitivity basis points basis points the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
in addition  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
