amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling and administrative expense    environmental remediation costs operating income    year end backlogs piping systems and process equipment    comparison of to sales declined percent producing much lower operating income of  after six years of noteworthy unit volume growth  showed a percent decline because of lower demand and a surge in imports 
the unit volume decline came from lower commodity stainless pipe sales resulting primarily from a surge in cheap imports coupled with significantly low piping systems and process equipment sales 
the company chose not to compete for business when pricing was driven solely by low priced imports  as average prices for commodity pipe declined eight percent for the year compared to last year 
lower gross profits were caused by low plant utilization rates  more competitive pricing for pipe  and a loss from piping systems 
although the stainless steel fabrication shop about broke even  a  loss was incurred in the carbon pipe fabrication shop opened in low demand in the pulp and paper industry resulting in lower unit volumes caused the poor performance in piping systems 
lower sales commissions and profit based incentives accounted for the nine percent decline in selling and administrative expenses 
for information related to environmental matters  see note h to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to sales and operating income declined and percent  respectively  from these percentages as well as others in this report are after giving effect to the extra production days from having weeks included in the fiscal year 
the dollar decline in sales for was the result of an percent decrease in average selling prices verses unit volume was actually up slightly in after experiencing an unprecedented surge in pipe prices during  the trend reversed and prices declined precipitously in back to levels existing before the price increases 
a primary factor contributing to the decline in prices was the pricing trends of flat rolled stainless steel  the raw material from which pipe is made 
pipe prices are closely tied to the cost of flat rolled stainless steel  which experienced similar pricing fluctuations over the past three years 
the bulk of the decrease in operating income occurred in the first quarter of the year when market dynamics were completely different from the first quarter of during the first quarter of  the price declines in stainless steel pipe prices had just begun and profits were still good 
by the first quarter of  prices were down percent from a year earlier and profits were at extremely low levels 
exacerbating the big decline in first quarter profits from stainless pipe was a loss from piping systems and process equipment compared to good profitability in the first quarter of the loss from these products was primarily due to low production levels caused by customer stretch outs in delivery dates 
lower profit based incentives accounted for the decline in selling and administrative expenses 
chemicals segment the following table summarizes operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note q to consolidated financial statements 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling and administrative expense    environmental remediation costs  operating income   comparison of to the chemicals segment experienced a sales decline of seven percent for the year and operating income fell significantly to   before the special charge for environmental remediation costs 
both colors and specialty chemicals experienced a decline in sales from the prior year 
colors sales were down two percent 
without the acquisition of organic pigments on july   total chemicals segment sales would have declined percent and colors sales would have been down percent 
the continued downsizing of the domestic textile industry  because of low cost imports  led to less unit volume demand for colors compared to a year earlier 
sales prices were also lower continuing the deflationary trend that has been evident for several years 
sales of specialty chemicals were down percent because of lower demand for certain products and sales in from a toll project that ended in december the combination of weaker pricing for color products and low level of capacity utilization in both colors and specialty chemicals contributed to the decline in gross profits 
selling and administrative expenses increased percent because of the organic acquisition and additions to the sales staff 
for information related to environmental matters  see note h to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to sales and operating income increased and percent  respectively  aided by the acquisition of mc 
the prolonged decline in textile colors sales ended in the first quarter of with each of the subsequent quarters showing improvement over the prior year quarter 
the increased sales in these three quarters of about percent led to a five percent increase for the year 
the improvement resulted from increases in unit volumes in several of the product groups offset somewhat by falling prices from competitive pressure experienced throughout all of the textile colors product lines 
the acquisition of mc propelled specialty chemicals to percent of total chemicals segment sales for specialty chemicals sales  without mc s sales for  increased insignificantly over last year 
essentially all of the growth in the chemicals segment s operating income was produced by specialty chemicals  as profits from textile colors experi enced only a moderate gain 
the competitive pressure on selling prices continued to impair profitability throughout in textile colors 
the significant increase in specialty chemicals profits came from increased volume from projects  creating improved manufacturing variances that resulted in better profit margins  and the addition of mc 
selling and administrative expenses increased percent from including expenses of mc for a full year in versus two months in  and from additional selling expenses related to the addition of a bu product manager in november of unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note q to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of these items 
comparison of to the percent decrease in corporate expenses resulted from lower profit based incentives and professional fees 
the company benefited from lower interest expense on reduced borrowings under the line of credit with a bank  and higher interest income earned on cash invested during the year 
comparison of to the decrease in corporate expenses resulted from lower profit based incentives 
interest expense declined from reduced borrowings under the line of credit with a bank and a  reduction in long term debt paid in june current conditions and outlook the metals segment experienced a percent decline in unit volume in the fourth quarter together with average sales prices that were percent lower 
this decline led to a percent decrease in sales to  compared to a year earlier 
a surge in cheap imports  producing lower commodity stainless pipe sales  and historically low piping systems and process equipment sales caused the unit volume decline 
average prices suffered from a shift in product mix to a much lower percentage of higher priced products as well as percent lower prices for commodity pipe 
operating income in the fourth quarter fell percent to  from the prior year resulting from more competitive pricing for pipe  the shift in product mix  a loss from piping systems  and the decline in unit volume  which produced low plant utilization rates 
the well publicized economic turmoil in asia and the pacific rim countries is largely responsible for the cheap import surge in stainless pipe 
as long as the u 
s 
remains the dumping ground for the world s excess capacity  the stainless pipe business will remain uncertain 
on the other hand  the outlook for piping systems and process equipment is excellent 
the year begins with a solid backlog of  up percent from a year earlier 
management expects significant profits from these products in compared to the losses suffered in the carbon shop was closed in december and a smaller shop was opened adjacent to our stainless shop 
because of the greatly reduced costs  management expects this carbon shop to operate profitably in the chemicals segment suffered an operating loss in the fourth quarter of  after a  pretax environmental charge  on a percent sales decline to  colors sales were down two percent 
without the acquisition of organic  total chemicals segment sales would have declined percent and colors sales would have been down percent 
factors causing the sales decline were identical to those experienced throughout the year as discussed in the chemicals segment analysis 
the operating loss for the quarter came primarily from specialty chemicals as sales for the quarter were down percent 
the sales decline was caused by the timing of production under certain toll contracts  lower demand for certain products  and sales in from a toll project that ended in december the low level of capacity utilization led to significantly lower gross profits 
management believes that initiatives taken in will lead to better operating results in and beyond 
the acquisition of organic makes the company a leader in the domestic textile pigments business with an unmatched ability to provide unique high quality printing systems 
organic also gives the company an entree into aqueous dispersions used in printing inks for paper 
the benefits from this acquisition are expected to become evident in the company devoted much time and effort in perfecting the process and installing the equipment needed to manufacture an agricultural chemical under a toll agreement 
initial production has now begun and plans call for this to become the company s largest toll product as the year progresses 
in mid  the company added a salesman to market color and chemical products to the textile industry in central america

year compliance the company has completed its assessment of all systems that could be affected by the year based on the assessment  the company completed software reprogramming and replacement  testing and implementation during the work included both information and production systems 
the work was completed by company employees and no significant costs were incurred other than normal personnel costs 
in addition  the company has gathered information about the year compliance status of significant suppliers and customers and continues to monitor their compliance 
to date  the company is not aware of any year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that a supplier or customer will be year ready 
management believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue 
since the company has been operating the revised software since the second quarter of  and the assessment of its suppliers did not reveal a material issue that would prevent receiving necessary materials and supplies to continue normal operations  the company has no contingency plans in place 
although all internal programming work has been completed  if an undetected system failure should occur  or one of the company s key suppliers does not become year ready  the company may not be able to complete customer orders 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also affect the company 
if issues related to year should arise  the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
