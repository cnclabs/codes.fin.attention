item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview first sierra financial  inc customizes lease financing products and offers servicing  consulting and technology solutions for commercial customers 
we acquire  originate  sell and service equipment leases relating to a wide range of equipment  including computers and peripherals  software  medical  dental  diagnostic  telecommunications  office  automotive servicing  hotel security  food services  tree service and industrial 
the equipment we finance generally has a purchase price of less than  with an average of approximately  for leases originated in and  for leases originated in because of their relatively small size  the leases we finance are commonly referred to in the finance industry as small ticket leases 
during  we consummated mergers with independent capital corporation  integrated lease management  inc  vendor leasing  inc  tfs  inc  st century credit leasing services  inc  and the republic group  inc 
which were accounted for as poolings of interests 
the accompanying financial statements and the related discussion of results of operations for the years ended december  and have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations of all material acquired companies 
prior to july   we structured our securitization transactions to meet the criteria for sales of lease financing receivables under generally accepted accounting principles 
thus  for all securitizations completed prior to this date  we recorded a gain on sale of lease financing receivables when we included the receivables in a securitization 
effective as of july   we made a strategic decision to alter the structure of our future securitization transactions so as to retain the leases we acquire and originate on our balance sheet and earn an interest margin on those assets over the life of the leases 
prior to making this strategic decision  our senior management and board of directors analyzed the impact of recognizing interest income over the life of the assets held on our balance sheet  our funding strategies  the credit quality of our lease receivables  the overall strength of our balance sheet and our positive cash flow characteristics 
we determined that cash flows from our securitized assets would not be significantly different whether securitizations were structured as financings or as sales 
accordingly  we do not expect this change to have a significant impact on our cash flow 
we do expect that  initially  our earnings per share will be negatively affected by the change 
however  we believe that the change will build long term value for first sierra and its stockholders by establishing consistent portfolio earnings  removing uncertainty in recognition of income  limiting earnings volatility and enhancing franchise value 
we began operations in june and initially developed a program to purchase leases from leasing companies that had the ability to originate significant lease volume and were willing and able to provide us with credit protection and perform some of the more labor intensive servicing functions on an ongoing basis with respect to the leases sold to us 
this program  referred to as our private label program  was designed to provide us with access to high volumes of leases eligible for the securitization market  while minimizing our risk of loss 
each private label lease source provides us with credit protection through a combination of recourse and purchase price holdback features and performs servicing functions such as credit collection  equipment repossession and liquidation with respect to the leases they sell to us 
generally  we receive and process all lease payments on leases that we purchase under our private label program 
we have experienced significant growth in our private label program since its inception 
under this program  we purchased million of leases in  million of leases in  million of leases in  million of leases in and million of leases in our weighted average yield on private label leases from inception through december  was 
in  as part of our growth strategy  we began targeting additional sources of lease volume from small ticket lease brokers who were unable or unwilling to provide the credit protection or perform the servicing functions required under our private label program and through relationships with manufacturers  dealers and other vendors of equipment 
we established our wholesale and retail programs in through two strategic acquisitions and have expanded these programs through additional acquisitions in and in a typical wholesale or retail arrangement  we originate leases without recourse to the lease source 
we also perform all servicing functions on leases acquired or originated under our wholesale and retail programs 
as a result  our yields are higher than those on our private label leases 
our weighted average yields on our wholesale leases were in  in  and in our weighted average yields on our retail leases were in  in and in under our wholesale program  we funded million of leases in  million of leases in and million of leases in under our retail program  we funded million of leases in  million of leases in  and million of leases in we established our captive finance program with our acquisition of independent lease management  inc in march during  we funded million of leases under our captive finance program  all of which we subsequently sold to third parties 
as a result  substantially all of the revenue we generated under this program during was from servicing income rather than yield income 
in the future  we intend to retain a portion of leases funded under our captive finance program in our lease portfolio until they can be financed  securitized or otherwise sold 
results of operations compared to gain on sale of lease receivables decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease in leases sold was largely the result of our strategic decision  effective july   to alter the structure of our securitization transactions so as to retain our lease financing receivables on our balance sheet after securitization and recognize interest income over the life of the leases  rather than recognizing gain on sale at the time of securitization 
because of this decision  the volume of lease receivables securitized that met the criteria for sales of lease financing receivables under generally accepted accounting principles decreased from million in to million in gains from direct sales of lease financing receivables increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase directly resulted from an increase in volumes of leases brokered or discounted to third parties 
interest income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily related to a increase in our average balance of lease receivables outstanding during as a result of our decision to retain lease receivables on our balance sheet after securitization 
an increase in our weighted average yield of lease receivables  resulting from the fact that leases acquired under our retail program  which are higher yielding  represented a larger percentage of our total originations in than in  also contributed to the overall increase in interest income 
servicing income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from a increase in the weighted average balance of lease receivables serviced under our securitization program  which was partially offset by a decrease in the ratio of late fees collected to total assets owned and serviced 
the ratio of late fees collected to total assets owned and serviced decreased because of lower delinquencies in our portfolio of owned and serviced leases 
the change in the structure of our securitization transactions also served to offset the increase in servicing income 
effective july   when we began retaining lease receivables on our balance sheet after securitization  servicing fees related to lease receivables securitized after such date were recorded as reduction of interest expense rather than as servicing income 
other income decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  other income consists of miscellaneous income items and documentation and other fees we collect in connection with our origination and administration of leases 
although documentation and administration fees increased by  in due to the overall expansion of our business  other miscellaneous income items decreased by  in salaries and benefits increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to a increase in the number of people we employed from december  to december  the number of employees increased because of our acquisitions as well as the general expansion of our business 
during the fourth quarter as a part of our ongoing effort to increase the efficiency of our operations  we eliminated certain administrative positions and underperforming sales people thereby reducing our work force by people  or  from people on september  interest expense increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily related to a increase in outstanding borrowings as a result of our decision  effective july   to retain lease receivables and the related borrowings on our balance sheet after securitization 
the increase was partially offset by the servicing fees and cash flows allocable to trust certificates that we received from lease receivables securitized after july  as we retain lease receivables on our balance sheet  the related servicing fees and cash flows allocable to the trust certificates are recorded as a reduction of interest expense 
provision for credit losses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million charge to write down the carrying value of our investment in trust certificates as a result of the widening of the spread over treasuries paid to investors in securitization transactions from the time we initially securitized our leases in our securitized funding facilities to the time we permanently securitized our leases in december the widening of spreads was due to economic turmoil in russia and asia and other economic factors 
in december  we were successful in completing a public securitization in a difficult market 
this write down affects only the lease receivables we securitized prior to july  as for leases securitized after july   we no longer record an investment in trust certificate and gain on sale related to such securitizations 
the increase in provision for credit losses was also the result of an increase in lease receivables retained on our balance sheet during  which also resulted from our decision to retain leases on balance sheet effective july  depreciation and amortization increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in goodwill and other intangible assets during  due to our acquisition of five businesses from april through october which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a increase in our fixed assets from december to december also contributed to the increase in deprecation and amortization 
other general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the general expansion of our business and the acquisitions referred to above 
in april  we acquired nexsoft  inc of denver  colorado 
nexsoft is a software development firm specializing in software for the equipment leasing industry 
we accounted for this transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the purchase price to the net assets acquired and to purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development includes the value of products in the development stage which were not considered to have reached technological feasibility 
as a result  we expensed million of acquisition costs during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of expenses in connection with the acquisition or proposed acquisition of companies accounted for as poolings of interests 
approximately  of this amount related to our proposed merger with the oliver allen corporation  which we mutually agreed to terminate in august we did not incur any of these acquisition costs during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the relocation of our operations center from jupiter  florida to houston  texas 
we did not incur any of these relocation costs during the year ended december  compared to during the years ended december  and  we sold leases with an aggregate principal balance of million and million  respectively  net of unearned income  through our securitization program 
we recognized gains of million and million  respectively  as a result of these sales and retained trust certificates in the related trusts 
the gains we recognized upon sales of leases through securitization transactions increased as a percentage of leases sold through securitization transactions from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  this increase was directly attributable to an increase in the weighted average interest rate of leases we sold as a result of the inclusion of higher yielding leases acquired under our wholesale and retail programs and a decrease in the level of trust certificates we were required to retain in the securitization trusts 
additionally  we recognized gains of million on leases we sold or discounted to third parties during the year ended december   an increase of million from the previous year 
we also recognized a gain of  upon the sale of a portfolio of lease receivables with an aggregate principal balance of million to a third party during interest income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily related to an increase of million during of interest income recognized on trust certificates we retained in our securitization transactions 
the remaining difference resulted from a increase in the average rate earned on the leases 
the increase in the average rate earned on the leases was directly attributable to the formation of our wholesale and retail programs in july servicing income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in leases serviced for others from december  to december  other income increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily related to an increase in documentation and other fees we collected in connection with our origination and administration of leases due to the expansion of our retail and wholesale originations 
salaries and benefits increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of people we employed 
the number of employees increased because we acquired ten companies from july through november in addition  salaries and benefits increased due to the higher level of servicing required as a result of the formation of our wholesale and retail programs in july interest expense increased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase related to additional indebtedness we assumed in connection with acquisitions at higher interest rates than those under our existing warehouse facilities  which were substantially offset by shorter periods that we held leases prior to securitization due to the formation of our securitized funding facilities  and reduced amounts of subordinated notes payable outstanding due to our repayment of one note with proceeds from our initial public offering in may provision for credit losses increased million  or  from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the origination of million of leases under our wholesale and retail programs during the year ended december   which have a greater exposure to credit losses than leases originated under our private label program 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions referred to above as well as a increase in depreciation of fixed assets owned at december  other general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the general expansion of our business and our acquisition of eight businesses in liquidity and capital resources our lease finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new equipment leases 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through borrowings under our funding facilities  sales of our common stock and by including our leases in public and private securitization transactions 
during the first quarter of  we sold  shares of common stock in a secondary public offering  raising net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we expect to continue to require access to large amounts of capital to maintain and expand our volume of leases funded and  depending upon market conditions  to complete acquisitions of additional lease finance companies 
our uses of cash include the acquisition and origination of equipment leases  payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under our securitized funding facilities  and the payment of operating and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
the structure of our lease funding programs  including the holdback and recourse features of our private label program  along with the structure of our securitized funding facilities and public securitization transactions  enabled us to generate positive cash flow from operations in  and we do not expect the strategic decision we made in the third quarter of to retain our lease receivables on our balance sheet as long term investments to affect our cash flows from operations 
we use our securitized funding facilities to fund the acquisition and origination of leases that satisfy the eligibility requirements established under each facility 
these funding facilities provide us with advance rates that generally do not require us to utilize our capital during the period that we are financing lease receivables under the facilities 
the liquidity provided under some of our facilities is generally interim in nature and we seek to refinance or resell the lease receivables that we fund under these interim facilities through our public securitization program within six to twelve months after we acquire or originate the leases 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances  cash flow from operations  net proceeds from future securitization transactions and amounts available under our securitized funding facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
securitized funding facilities as of december   our five securitized funding facilities had an aggregate funding capacity of million 
as of december   million was available under these facilities 
through june   our securitized funding facilities were structured so that transfers to those facilities were considered sales under generally accepted accounting principles 
effective july   concurrent with our strategic decision to retain our lease receivables on our balance sheet as long term investments  we modified the structure of our securitized funding facilities so that advances under the facilities would be considered debt under generally accepted accounting principles 
the cash flows available to us  which are generally based on the advance rates and discount rates set forth in the facility agreements  were generally unaffected by the modifications to the agreements 
public securitization transactions to date  the proceeds that we have received in our public securitization transactions have generally been sufficient to repay amounts we have borrowed under our securitized funding facilities  as well as issuance expenses related to each securitization 
we generally structure our securitization transactions to qualify as financings for income tax purposes 
therefore  no income tax is payable in the current period on the gain recognized 
we anticipate that our future financings of equipment leases will be principally through securitization transactions and  to a lesser extent  through portfolio sales and sales to third party financing sources 
as of december   we had completed four public securitization transactions involving the issuance of million of senior and subordinated securities 
we completed the series and transactions in  the series transaction in september  and the series transaction in december in connection with the series and transactions  class a certificates  rated aaa by standard and poor s  aaa by moody s investor services and aaa by duff phelps credit rating co  were sold in the public market 
the class b and class b certificates were rated bbb and bb  respectively  by duff phelps credit rating co  and were sold on a non recourse basis in the private market 
in connection with the series transaction  four tranches of class a notes  rated aaa by standard and poor s  aaa by moody s investor services  inc and aaa by duff phelps credit rating co  were sold in the public market 
the class b and class b notes were rated bbb and aa  respectively  by duff phelps credit rating co  and were sold on a non recourse basis in the private market 
the class b note was enhanced through a letter of credit with dresdner bank ag  which resulted in the higher ratings 
we retained a class b note  which was rated b by duff phelps credit rating co  for future sale in the private market 
due to our ability to structure and sell class b and class b rated components of our securitizations  the remaining interest that we were required to retain was reduced  which allowed us to maximize the cash proceeds generated from each transaction 
in connection with the series transaction  four tranches of class a notes  rated aaa by standard and poor s  aaa by moody s investor services  inc  aaa by duff phelps credit rating co 
and aaa by fitch ibca  inc were sold in the public market 
the class b and class b notes were rated bbb and bb by duff phelps credit rating co 
and fitch ibca  inc  and were sold and financed on a non recourse basis in the private market 
a class b note was rated b by duff phelps credit rating co  and fitch ibca  inc and was retained by the company for future sale in the private market 
we were able to realize approximately of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the equipment leases included in our series and securitizations  approximately of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the equipment leases included in our series securitization  and approximately of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the equipment leases included in our series securitization 
subordinated notes in may  we entered into a million subordinated revolving credit facility with an affiliate 
the commitment level on this facility is scheduled to decrease by million per year 
advances under this facility bear interest at per annum 
as of december   we had not borrowed any money under this facility 
in connection with the acquisition of heritage in may  we issued a million subordinated note payable to the former owner of heritage 
such note bears interest at per annum  with principal payable semi annually over years 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of titan finance  limited  a company incorporated in england and wales  in exchange for  in cash and  in convertible subordinated promissory notes 
the promissory notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually  with the outstanding principal amount due october  the notes will automatically convert into shares of the company s common stock when the average trading price of the common stock for the twenty days preceding conversion equals or exceeds 
upon conversion  the company will issue one share of common stock for each of outstanding principal amount of the notes 
interest rate management activities our implicit yield on all of our leases is based on a fixed interest rate because the leases have scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the leases 
when we acquire or originate leases  we base our pricing on the spread we expect to achieve between the implicit yield to us on each lease and the effective interest we will have to pay when we include the lease in a public securitization transaction or otherwise sell the lease 
increases in interest rates between the time we acquire or originate the lease and the time we include the lease in a public securitization transaction or otherwise sell the lease could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
our policy is to generally mitigate the risk on changes in interest rates 
we mitigate the volatility of interest rate movement between the time we acquire or originate a lease and the time we include the lease in a public securitization transaction by hedging movements in interest rates using interest rate swap derivatives which match the underlying cash flow associated with the leases we originate 
under these swap agreements  we receive interest on the notional amount at either the day libor or the day aa corporate commercial paper index  and we pay a fixed rate which is equal to a spread over the yield to maturity of us treasury securities similar to the maturities of the specific leases being held for securitization 
we generally implement these hedging arrangements when our portfolio of unhedged leases reaches million 
at certain times  changes in the interest rate market present favorable conditions to hedge against future rate movement 
we may  from time to time  enter into hedges against interest rate movement in anticipation of future origination volume in order to take advantage of unique market conditions  but we generally limit this activity to levels where we are confident of origination in the near term 
year readiness the year problem exists because many computer programs  embedded systems and components were designed to refer to a year by the last two digits of the year  such as for as a result  some of these systems may not properly recognize that the year that follows is and not if those problems are not corrected  the systems could fail or produce erroneous results 
no one knows the extent of the potential impact of the year problem generally 
our state of readiness during  we began our year program by making initial inquiries of the software vendors for our major applications as to the year readiness of such applications 
we received assurances from these vendors that these applications are year ready 
we also began making inquiries of significant customers and other counterparties as to their year readiness 
for purposes of our year program  we have divided all of our applications  systems  relationships and services into three groups mission critical items are those that we require to operate our business without disruption  important items are those that we do not require to operate our business without disruption but that are important to our day to day operations  and ordinary items are those that do not depend on date specific data or are not important to our day to day operations 
our year program for all of our hardware  software  operating systems  relationships and services consists of the following six phases inventory during this first phase of our year program  we compiled information relating to all hardware  software  operating systems  relationships and services that may be affected by the year problem 
as of the date of this report  we have substantially completed this phase 
impact analysis this phase will encompass the initial analysis of all of our hardware and software  including embedded technologies and other non information technology applications  and our operating systems  relationships and services  to determine whether there is a possibility that they are not year ready  and how this may affect us 
we will also investigate and categorize the hardware  software  systems  relationships and services as mission critical  important  or ordinary 
we expect this phase to be completed during the second quarter of solution planning based on the results of our impact analysis  we will identify the necessary steps to ensure year readiness 
this analysis will determine whether the hardware  software  systems  relationship or services will be scanned using year scanning software  manually checked  or will be checked for readiness through website or personal letter confirmation 
we expect this phase to be completed by the end of the second quarter of corrective procedures in this phase  we will detail and perform the steps outlined from the results of the solution planning phase to identify those fields or processes that contain a year problem  and to develop appropriate corrective procedures 
these corrective procedures may include remediation  replacement  or retirement 
we expect this phase to be completed by the end of the third quarter of for mission critical applications and the end of the fourth quarter of for important applications 
quality assurance during this phase  we will ensure that the necessary steps that are taken to test any date related issues can be properly executed to create year readiness for the specific process or system 
in addition  this phase will ensure that all related processes and systems are not affected by the corrective action 
we expect this phase to be completed by the end of the third quarter of for mission critical applications and the end of the fourth quarter of for important applications 
contingency planning in the event that we are unable to correct a year problem in a mission critical process or system prior to september   a contingency plan will be completed to ensure continued operation after december  in completing this contingency plan  we will identify alternatives  including manual processes  the expected correction date  and any conversion issues from the manual process to the corrected system 
costs to address our year issues we did not incur any material cost to address year issues during the year ended december  we estimate that we will incur costs approximating  during to complete our resolution of year issues 
risks of our year issues 
we have not identified any specific known events  trends or uncertainties which are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
we will continue to review these issues as we evaluate the progress of our year program 
the foregoing constitutes a year statement and readiness disclosure subject to the protections afforded it by the federal year information and readiness disclosure act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  and exchange rates 
we have instituted risk management policies to monitor and limit these exposures as follows interest rate risk to manage our interest rate risk  we have implemented policies that are designed to minimize changes in our cost of funds associated with changes in benchmark interest rates after lease receivables have been funded 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful when all related and offsetting transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
our implicit yield on all of our leases is based on a fixed interest rate 
we generally obtain initial funding for lease acquisitions and originations through borrowings under our securitized funding facilities and  from time to time  depending on market conditions  we include the lease receivables in a securitization transaction or portfolio sale 
because the securitized funding facilities bear interest at floating rates  whereas the permanent securitizations or portfolio sales bear interest at a spread over the benchmark treasury rate which is fixed at the time the transaction is completed  we are exposed to the risk of an increase in the cost of funds from adverse interest rate movements during the period from the date of borrowing through the date that the underlying leases are included in a securitization transaction or otherwise sold 
we seek to minimize our exposure by entering into amortizing interest swap transactions under which the notional amount of the contract changes monthly to match the anticipated amortization of the underlying leases 
as of december   we were engaged in various interest rate swap transactions 
the total notional amount involved in these transactions closely matched our outstanding balance of lease receivables 
the following earnings sensitivity analysis assumes an immediate closing of a permanent securitization transaction on lease receivables outstanding as of december  and an increase of basis points in the benchmark treasury 
as indicated in the analysis  an immediate change in the interest rate would have a minimal impact on our earnings because the increase in our cost of funds from an increase in the benchmark treasury would be substantially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds from the amortization of swap settlement proceeds received when our swap positions are unwound 
pre tax earnings change from increase in benchmark treasury by basis points decrease in pre tax earnings from increase in interest expense  increase in pre tax earnings from decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of swap proceeds  net decrease in pre tax earnings  credit spread risk we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in credit spreads between the time we borrow money under our securitized funding facilities and the time we securitize or otherwise sell the leases 
we can partially offset this type of increase in our cost of funds by engaging in interest rate swap transactions and benefiting from an increase in interest rate swap spreads 
however  it is not possible for us to completely offset our credit spread risk through hedging transactions 
based on our lease receivables outstanding as of december   an increase of basis points in the credit spread would result in a  decrease in our pre tax earnings in  provided that there is no corresponding increase in the swap spread which would partially offset the decrease in pre tax earnings 
foreign exchange risk we entered the small ticket leasing market in the united kingdom in the third quarter of through our acquisition of suffolk street group 
as of december   our pound sterling denominated lease receivables totaled approximately million 
as of the same date  our pound sterling denominated borrowings had an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately million 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates when translating these pound sterling denominated revenues and expenses to united states dollars 
based on lease receivables and borrowings outstanding as of december   a decrease in the relative value of the british pound compared to the united states dollar would result in a  decrease in our pretax earnings in while the earnings sensitivity analyses presented above represent our best estimate of the impact on our earnings and balance sheet of various market rate movements  the actual behavior will likely differ from what we project 
from time to time  we recalibrate our assumptions and adjust our modeling techniques as needed to improve the accuracy of the risk measurement results 
you should also be aware that actual movements of market interest rates can include changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the basis relationship between various market rates  among other changes  which are not captured in the sensitivity analyses presented here
