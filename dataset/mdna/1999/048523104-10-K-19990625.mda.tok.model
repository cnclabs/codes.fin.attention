item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide it strategy consulting and systems integration services to customers exclusively in the financial services industry  primarily banks 
our service offerings are organized around four practice areas it strategy consulting  consolidations and conversions  year resolution and electronic commerce and home banking 
our revenues are derived primarily from professional fees billed to customers on a time and materials basis  or in certain instances on a fixed price basis 
included in revenues are reimbursable contract related travel and entertainment expenses  which are separately billed to clients 
substantially all of our contracts  other than fixed price contracts  are terminable by the customer following limited notice and without significant penalty to the customer 
revenues from fixed price contracts represented approximately and of the company s revenues for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
revenues from our five largest customers in fiscal  and were  and  respectively  as a percentage of revenues 
in fiscal  first security information technology  inc  national city corporation  associated banc corp  ust data services  inc and susquehanna bancshares corp 
accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of revenues 
in fiscal  associated banc corp  first security information technology  inc  national city corporation  nations bank corp 
and abn amro information technology services accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of revenues 
in fiscal  first security information technology  inc  citizens savings bank and citizens trust company  fleet services corporation  electronic payments services  inc and associated banc corp 
accounted for    and  respectively  of revenues 
because a significant portion of our revenues are derived from services related to deregulation and consolidation activities in the financial services industry  changes in the regulatory environment or a reduction in consolidation activity have in the past  and could in the future  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the loss of a major customer or termination of a major project as a result of an acquisition of a customer by an organization to which the company does not currently provide services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on december   we announced that one of our major customers  national city corporation  would not be extending its contract with us beyond december  for the nine months ended december   this customer accounted for approximately of our revenues 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from customers located in north america 
cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits for personnel dedicated to customer assignments  fees paid to subcontractors for work performed in connection with customer assignments  and reimbursable contract related travel and entertainment expenses incurred in connection with the delivery of our services 
customer project margins and personnel utilization percentages are the most significant variables in determining our income from continuing operations 
we manage our personnel utilization rates by monitoring personnel needs and generally adjust personnel levels based on specific project requirements 
the number of staff assigned to particular projects may vary widely depending on the size  duration  degree of completion and complexity of each engagement 
delays in project completion and in implementation may result in periods when personnel are not assigned to active projects and  accordingly  result in lower average utilization rates during such periods  which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  we must maintain appropriate numbers of senior professionals both to oversee existing engagements and for business development activities 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses and promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with our management  finance and administrative groups  including recruiting  training  depreciation and amortization  and occupancy costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of revenues year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes discontinued operations  net of tax net income recent developments during the second half of fiscal  we experienced lower than anticipated bookings and our financial results have been  and continue to be  effected by a slowdown in merger and consolidation activity within the banking and financial services sector 
in addition  many of our clients are nearing completion of their yk projects which is having a negative impact on revenues in the near term 
further  on december   we announced that one of our major customers  national city corporation  would not be extending its contract with us beyond december  for the nine months ended december   this customer accounted for approximately of our revenues 
as a result of these factors  we expect  at least through the remainder of calendar  that we will continue to experience lower revenue growth rates compared to prior fiscal years and will likely have revenue less than the corresponding quarters in the prior fiscal year which  in turn  will have an adverse impact on our earnings 
in an effort to bring expenses more in line with expected near term revenue  the company reduced its headcount by sixty five people or approximately of total workforce effective april  at may   we had a total of full time employees 
variability of operating results variations in our revenues and operating results have occurred from quarter to quarter and may continue to occur as a result of a number of factors 
quarterly revenues and operating results can depend on the number  size and scope of customer projects commenced and completed during a quarter  changes in employee utilization rates  changes in average billing rates  the number of working days in a quarter  the timing of introduction of new service offerings  both by us and our competitors  changes in pricing  both by us and our competitors  loss of a significant customer  loss of key personnel  other factors that adversely impact the financial services industry  and general economic conditions 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle is relatively long  ranging from one to six months for new projects with existing customers and three to six months for new customers  and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of projects or other factors that adversely impact the financial services industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  the relatively long length of our sales cycle may negatively impact the operating results for any particular quarter as a result of increased sales and marketing expenses without associated increases in revenues in the particular quarter 
furthermore  many of our projects are  and may be in the future  terminable without customer penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project or loss of a major customer could require us to maintain or terminate underutilized employees  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned persons or higher than expected severance expenses 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues increased for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march   to million from million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in volume of services delivered to customers and an increase in the average billing rate 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing and of revenues  respectively 
the dollar increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the average number of billable personnel from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues is due primarily to decreased utilization rates 
based on current industry conditions  we expect that decreased utilization rates will continue into fiscal year sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing and of revenues  respectively 
the overall dollar increase resulted primarily from an increase in travel related expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues reflects the significant increase in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing and of revenues  respectively 
the overall dollar increase is primarily due to increases in recruiting  occupancy and equipment costs to support the company s expansion during the year  as well as costs associated with being a public company 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the significant increase in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal interest income interest income increased million to million in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in the amount of cash and cash equivalents available for investment through the net proceeds received from the our initial public offering completed on may  of million and cash generated from operations of million 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
our tax rate may vary from period to period based on our expansion into areas with varying state and local statutory income tax rates 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to differences in applicable state income tax rates 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  to million from million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in volume of services delivered to customers and an increase in the average billing rate 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal  representing and  respectively  of revenues in each period 
the dollar increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in billable personnel from at march  to at march  the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues is due to increased utilization rates and billing rate increases 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal  representing and of revenues  respectively 
this increase resulted primarily from our decision to expand our sales and marketing group from eight employees at march  to seventeen employees at march  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal  representing and of revenues  respectively 
the overall dollar increase is primarily due to increases in recruiting  occupancy and equipment costs to support our expansion during the period 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the significant increase in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
our tax rate may vary from period to period based on our expansion into areas with varying state and local statutory income tax rates 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to differences in applicable state income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our initial public offering ipo of  shares of which  shares were offered by the company at a price of per share including  shares offered under an overallotment option 
our net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses were approximately million 
in addition to the ipo  we generated million in cash flows from operations in fiscal we have no long term debt and continue to operate primarily debt free 
working capital increased to million at march  compared to million at march  this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash of million 
net proceeds from the ipo of million contributed to the increase in cash as well as increased profitability 
our days sales in accounts receivable at march  was compared to days at march  the decrease in days sales outstanding was the result of increased emphasis on collections 
while we believe that the risk with respect to collection of accounts receivable is minimized by the creditworthiness of our customers  primarily banks and other financial institutions  and our credit and collection policies  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter collection problems in the future 
we attempt to further minimize this risk by performing ongoing credit valuations of our customers and maintaining an allowance for potential credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts and collection policies are adequate 
capital expenditures were approximately million and  for fiscals and  respectively  and were used principally for computer and other equipment software and to a lesser extent leasehold improvements 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  and will be used principally for computers and other equipment 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  together with cash provided from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
computer systems based on a two digit format will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
the year problem affects virtually all computer systems  processes  and products in all segments of the economy 
we are aware of the issues associated with the year issue and believe there are three general areas of potential exposure our own service offerings  our internal informational systems  and the effects of third party compliance efforts 
based on our analysis through march   we do not believe that the year issue will materially affect our business 
service offerings and products 
we believe that our information technology it strategy consulting and systems integration services will not be affected by the year issue because such it service offerings do not involve computer processes that store or manipulate date related fields 
we will continue to monitor newly developed or acquired it service offerings and products for year compliance 
in the event that any of our developed or acquired it service offerings or products are not year compliant in a timely manner  our sales may decline materially  customers and those with whom they do business may assert product liability and other claims  and our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
internal information systems 
we have conducted an assessment of our information technology systems and non it systems such as voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors 
as a result of our assessment  we have remediated our voice mail  telephone system  corporate workstation computers and their servers  making them year compliant 
we determined during this assessment that our mission critical focus would be the accounting and finance area 
as a result  we have scrutinized and tested for year compliance both the accounting software created by third parties and internally developed time and expense reporting and project accounting software applications 
for such third party software applications  we have obtained written confirmation that the software applications are year compliant 
we also expect that results of the independent testing of our third party payroll application adp will be completed by adp on schedule 
we believe that our internally developed applications are already year compliant and testing of the mission critical areas  as outlined above  will be completed by june  based on currently available information  expenses to date  plus the expenses we believe will be associated with these efforts in the future  will be immaterial and have provided for the enhancements of these systems in our operating and capital budgets for the current fiscal year 
however  if compliance efforts of which we are not currently aware are required and are not completed on time  or if the cost of any required updating  modification or replacement of any of our it systems exceeds our estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
effects of third party compliance 
in addition to our internal systems  we rely on third party relationships in the conduct of our business 
for example  third party vendors handle the payroll function for us  and we also rely on the services of the landlord at our facility  telecommunication companies  banks  utilities and commercial airlines  among others 
we have obtained assurances from our landlord and our material vendors and suppliers that there will be no interruption of service as a result of the year issue 
we have prepared contingency plans to ameliorate the negative effects on us in the event the year issue results in the unavailability of any of these services 
however  contingency plans developed by us may not prevent a service interruption on the part of one or more of our third party vendors or suppliers 
in addition  the failure on the part of the accounting systems of our clients due to the year issue could result in a delay in the payment of invoices issued by us for services and expenses 
a material service interruption from a material vendor or supplier or a failure of the accounting systems of a significant number of our clients would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have prepared written contingency plans to address failures in our major it and non it systems 
these plans include identification of major systems  dependencies on third parties  and resources and strategies necessary to restore operations or work around failures 
the failure of our accounting systems resulting from a year related power system outage  particularly at the end of a fiscal period  could represent a reasonably likely worst case scenario 
our contingency plan provides for an alternate site that is equipped with back up power systems that can support the mission critical areas 
the information concerning our year compliance effort includes forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause actual events or costs to be materially different than indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  unanticipated costs of remediation and replacement of our year compliance efforts  our inability to meet our targeted dates as scheduled and the failure of our material suppliers and other strategic relationships to ensure year compliance 
any estimates and projections described have been developed by management and are based on our best judgments together with the information that is available to date 
due to the many uncertainties surrounding the year issue  our stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
certain factors that may affect future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
variability of quarterly operating results variations in our revenues and operating results have occurred from quarter to quarter and may continue to occur as a result of a number of factors 
quarterly revenues and operating results can depend on the number  size and scope of customer projects commenced and completed during a quarter  changes in employee utilization rates  changes in average billing rates  the number of working days in a quarter  the timing of introduction of new service offerings  both by us and our competitors  changes in pricing  both by us and our competitors  loss of a significant customer  loss of key personnel  other factors that adversely impact the financial services industry  and general economic conditions 
additionally  we have experienced difficulty forecasting the timing of revenues because the length of our sales cycle ranges from one to six months for new projects with existing customers and three to six months for new customers 
in addition  the relatively long length of our sales cycle may negatively impact the operating results for any particular quarter as a result of increased sales and marketing expenses without associated increases in revenues in that particular quarter 
because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of customer projects  particularly at or near the end of a quarter  can cause us to have significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and can result in losses 
we attempt to manage our personnel utilization rates by closely monitoring project timetables and staffing requirements for new projects 
while we must adjust our professional staff to reflect active projects  we must maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing customer projects and participate with our sales force in securing new customer projects 
furthermore  we may experience a significant time lag between the date we hire professional staff and the date they become fully productive 
the rate at which new professional staff become productive could cause us to have material fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
additionally  to the extent such increased operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of our projects are  and may be in the future  terminable without customer penalty 
a customer s unanticipated termination of a major project or the loss of a major customer could require us to maintain or terminate underutilized employees  causing us to have a higher than expected number of unassigned persons or higher than expected severance expenses 
due to all of the foregoing factors  our results of operations may at times be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event our stock price could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on the financial services industry we derive substantially all of our revenues from customers in the financial services industry  primarily banks 
furthermore  we expect that we will continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from such customers for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions which adversely impact the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience cyclical fluctuations in profitability 
these fluctuations have in the past  and may in the future  affect our customers willingness or ability to fund projects for which we may be engaged 
in addition  because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from services related to the deregulation and consolidation of the financial services industry  regulatory changes or a reduction in consolidation activity have in the past  and may in the future  have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of revenues  dependence on major customers we have derived and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers 
for example  our five largest customers in fiscal  first security information technology  inc  national city corporation  associated banc corp  ust data services  inc and susquehanna bancshares corp  accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of revenues 
in fiscal  associated banccorp  first security information technology  inc  national city corporation  nationsbank corp 
and abn amro information technology services accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of revenues 
because a significant portion of our revenues are derived from services related to deregulation and consolidation activities in the financial services industry  changes in the regulatory environment or a reduction in consolidation activity have in the past  and may in the future  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the loss of a major customer or termination of a major project as a result of an acquisition of a customer by an organization to which the company does not currently provide services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from customers located in north america 
additionally  we may be materially adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or termination of a major project as a result of an acquisition of a customer by an organization to which we do not currently provide services 
for example  in december we announced that national city corporation  which accounted for and of our revenues in fiscal and  respectively  decided not to extend its contract with us beyond december  although our largest customers have varied from period to period  we anticipate that our results of operations will continue to significantly depend upon revenues of a small number of customers 
we cannot assure you that our major customers will continue to purchase our services at current levels  if at all  or that we will be able to replace revenues from such customers with revenues from other customers 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in revenues from  any of our major customers could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of fixed price contracts revenues from fixed price contracts represented approximately and of our revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
in making proposals for fixed priced contracts  we rely on estimated costs for completing the projects 
these estimates reflect  among other things  our calculations of the effectiveness of our technology and services as applied to a particular project 
any unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with our performance of fixed price contracts could materially adversely effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on the year market  reductions in year spending by our customers a portion of our revenue growth in fiscal and resulted from our customer s increased demand for services relating to the diagnosis and resolution of the year problem 
however  in fiscal we saw a significant slowdown in year spending by financial services companies 
in addition  we anticipate this demand will continue to diminish through the remainder of calendar and after the year as many customers resolve their year issues 
due to these factors  we cannot predict the market for year products and services 
the failure of growth in the market for year products and services could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key management personnel  including our chairman and chief executive officer  robert w 
howe  and our president and chief operating officer  william h 
gallagher 
the loss of either executive could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have employment agreements with each of these individuals  and with senior vice president  finance and administration and chief financial officer  paul k 
mcgrath  executive vice president and director of operations  peter a 
cahill and senior vice president  corporate development  paul james lynch 
these agreements include certain restrictive covenants relating to non disclosure of confidential business information and our right to inventions and technical improvements made by the employee 
such covenants are beneficial to us 
the agreements also prohibit the employee from soliciting our employees or customers for a period of two years after any termination of the employee s employment  but otherwise do not contain non competition provisions 
additionally  we have purchased million in key man insurance policies on the life of each of mr 
howe and mr 
gallagher 
availability of professional staff our business involves the delivery of professional services which is labor intensive 
thus  our success depends in large part on our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees 
many companies seek to hire qualified project managers causing them to be in great demand and likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and or retain our existing project managers and other senior personnel 
the loss of some or all of our senior staff could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our ability to secure and complete customer projects on a timely basis 
management of growth during fiscal  our staff increased from at march  to over employees at september  we ended fiscal year with employees 
to effectively manage such growth and change  we need to continue to improve our operational  financial  and other internal systems  and to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain our employees 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  or if our new employees do not achieve anticipated performance levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition many companies compete against us in the information technology and systems integration market  especially in the financial services industry 
additionally  rapid technological and market changes occur frequently 
we compete for customer projects and experienced personnel against a number of companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and revenues than us 
many of these competitors also have greater name recognition in the financial services industry 
our competitors operate in a variety of market segments including systems consulting and integration  application software  professional services such as computer equipment companies like international business machines corporation  multinational accounting firms  and general management consulting firms such as andersen consulting  computer sciences corporation and electronic data systems corporation 
in addition  numerous firms  many with focused local markets  have highly fragmented the custom software development market 
additionally  we also face competition from internal information technology departments of our customers 
in the future  we expect to experience increasing competition from companies offering established integration services and new service offerings and technologies 
in addition  strategic acquisitions or cooperative relationships among our current or potential competitors may increase their ability to expand or increase their service offerings to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors  may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such increased competition could result in lower utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  and reduced gross margin and loss of market share for the company  any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to be successful in the future we must respond promptly and effectively to customer demands  technological changes and competitors innovations 
we may not be able to respond as quickly as our competitors to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
furthermore  we may be unable to devote as many resources as our competitors to the development  promotion and sale of new service offerings to prospective customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully compete with existing or new competitors or that such competition will not effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change our success depends in part on our ability to develop information technology solutions that keep pace with rapid changes in computer technology  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs and preferences 
in particular  our future success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce new service offerings  improve existing service offerings and develop and maintain the skills necessary to keep pace with changing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing  introducing and marketing such service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis  or that the market will accept such service offerings  if developed 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our products will not become uncompetitive or obsolete as a result of products  technologies or service offerings developed by others 
our failure to address these challenges could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential for contract liability  project risks our services  especially solutions addressing the year problem  involve key aspects of our customers businesses and computer systems 
a customer could assert a claim against us as a result of a system failure regardless of our actual responsibility for such failure 
we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes or omissions in rendering our services 
despite this precaution  we cannot assure you that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable or will protect us from liability for damages 
additionally  we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions in excess of the applicable deductible amount 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such coverage on acceptable terms  or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not deny us coverage on a future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage  or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we would incur substantial costs and possibly suffer a diversion of management s attention from operations if litigation  regardless of its outcome  were to occur 
any contract liability claim or litigation against us could  therefore  materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because many of our projects are mission critical projects for major financial institutions  our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 
control by management our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
thus  while the members of our management have not entered into any agreement regarding the voting of their common stock  if they were to vote together  they could effectively control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of directors  adopting or amending provisions of our articles of organization and by laws  and approving mergers or other similar transactions  such as sales of substantially all of our assets 
because of this control possible acquirors may be discouraged from entering into transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which a possible acquiror might offer you a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
in addition  certain investors may only be willing to pay a reduced price for shares of our common stock because of such management control 
furthermore  our articles of organization do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors 
potential acquisitions in our normal course  we evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies that could complement or expand our business 
the risks associated with acquisitions include the retention of personnel  diversion of management s attention  unexpected liabilities  and tax and accounting issues 
if we were to complete an acquisition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to successfully integrate the acquired business or technologies into our existing business and operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the acquisition of any business or technology will cause us to successfully develop new service offerings  or that any such service offerings  if developed  will achieve market acceptance or profitability 
if we consummate one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock  or is financed with the net proceeds of the issuance of stock  you may suffer a significant dilution of your equity interest 
additionally  if we were to complete an acquisition to expand internationally  our business may be subject to a variety of risks affecting international operations  including difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  currency fluctuations  exchange rates  changes in regulatory requirements  and difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights 
thus  we cannot assure you that our business  financial condition or results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by a potential acquisition 
volatility of stock price the market price of the shares of common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have especially affected the market prices of equity securities of many information technology companies 
often these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies or have resulted from the failure of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter 
broad market fluctuations  or any failure of our operating results to meet market expectations in a particular quarter  may materially adversely affect the market price of your shares of common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  stockholders have sometimes instituted a securities class action suit against such company 
if such litigation were to arise against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
this could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as of march   we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in corporate money market accounts and collateralized repurchase agreements 
these securities are not subject to interest rate risk and will not fall in value if market interest rates increase 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars and take place in north america 
we do not believe foreign currency exchange rates or the introduction of the euro will have an impact on us
