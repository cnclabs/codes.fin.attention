see the discussion at the beginning of part i 
overview dtm corporation designs  develops  manufactures  markets and supports  on an international basis  rapid prototyping and rapid tooling systems and related powdered sintering materials and services 
the company s sinterstation systems and powdered sintering materials are based on proprietary and patented selective laser sintering technology 
dtm was incorporated in and completed its initial public offering ipo of common stock in may prior to shipment of its first generation sinterstation in  the company derived revenues solely from a rapid prototyping service bureau it operated in austin  texas 
in  the company sold its service bureau 
since  dtm has shipped over sinterstation systems worldwide 
the company s selective laser sintering process uses laser energy to sinter powdered material to create solid objects that aid in the design and manufacture of products 
the company s sinterstation systems employ a combination of software and hardware to produce functional models  patterns  injection holding tooling and metal ports from a variety of powdered materials 
customers input designs into the sinterstation systems in the form of the drawings 
the functional models are used to verify a design s form and fit 
the patterns can  in turn  be used for secondary processes such as the production of non durable molds and investment casting 
the company s rapidtool process employs selective laser sintering along with a furnace cycle to produce steel copper composite mold inserts that are used by the injection molder to produce production parts in quantity 
a variant of the rapidtool process is the production of mold inserts in the sinterstation system from a copper reinforced thermoplastic based material system  without the need for a furnace cycle 
these inserts produced with this product are used by the injection molder to produce short run production parts 
sinterstation systems also can be used in combination with the company s rapidtool process with a furnace cycle to produce metal parts 
customers input designs into the sinterstation systems in the form of cad drawings 
the company s sinterstation systems employ a combination of software and hardware to produce functional models  patterns  injection molding tooling and metal parts from a variety of powdered materials 
the company s sinterstation systems are purchased by manufacturers  universities  military and defense organizations and by service bureaus 
these service bureaus utilize rapid prototyping equipment to provide services to other companies involved in product development 
the company distributes its products in the united states  canada  western europe and certain pacific rim and south american countries 
in the united states and canada  the company employs a direct sales force 
in germany  dtm gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary  distributes dtm s products 
dtm gmbh is a sales and service organization whose efforts are augmented by sales agents in france  italy  portugal  spain and sweden 
in the united kingdom  dtm uk ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary  distributes and services dtm s products 
the company also distributes its goods and provides services in the pacific rim and south america through a network of independent agents  including agents in brazil  china  india  japan  singapore  south korea and taiwan 
dtm s sinterstation systems typically include hardware  material handling equipment  documentation  licenses for using dtm supplied software  licenses for using dtm supplied powdered sintering materials and installation 
they can be configured for use with a single sintering powder or for any combination of thermoplastic  foundry sands or metal sintering powders 
dtm typically offers its sinterstation systems packaged with a month limited warranty and preventive maintenance contract  installation services  training services and an initial supply of sintering materials 
dtm offers a wide range of proprietary sintering materials and software that optimizes their use in the sinterstation system 
the total value of a packaged offering is allocated among its various components systems and related equipment sintering materials  immediate services and deferred services 
revenues from the sale of products are recognized when title has transferred to the customer  the company s remaining obligations are insignificant and collection of the related receivable is probable  which typically is upon shipment 
the company defers from three to six percent of the revenues  excluding certain accessories  from each sinterstation system sale to cover the cost of a one year warranty period 
this deferred amount represents the company s estimate of the cost of providing such warranty and preventive maintenance service and is recognized ratably as service and support revenue over the month warranty period 
upon expiration of the month warranty period discussed above  the company offers for sale to its customers an annual maintenance contract  the revenues from which are recognized ratably as service and support revenue over the related support period 
in august  dtm commenced delivery of a third generation selective laser sintering system platform  named the sinterstation plus 
manufacture of the previous system platforms  marketed as the sinterstation and sinterstation  were discontinued in july with the introduction of the sinterstation plus  dtm has over the past year introduced a completely new generation of platforms  sintering materials and sintering processes 
the company believes that the increased demand for its products beginning in the second quarter of is a result of the new sintering materials that were introduced in the previous ten months 
however  there can be no assurance that this increased demand will continue 
the introduction of the new sinterstation plus in august of was the culmination of a year long project to design a system with a lower manufactured cost that would permit the company to be more price competitive while improving its gross margins 
mainly as a result of the sinterstation plus  fourth quarter total gross margins improved to from in the fourth quarter of these higher gross margins allowed the company to become profitable in the fourth quarter of revenues for were at record levels 
overall  revenues overcame a weak first quarter and increased by over the prior year 
the company has been attempting to remedy the softening in north american demand that the company experienced in mid through the introduction of second generation sintering materials for functional prototyping  short run tooling and long run tooling applications 
in  revenues derived from north american customers were up over internationally  revenues derived from european customers were up over revenues derived from customers in the pacific rim were down from  due to the economic conditions in that region

revenues increased to million in as compared to million in and million in the growth in revenues in was attributable to market growth in north america as domestic revenues grew by to million and international revenues declined by to million 
this decline in international revenues was  primarily  due to the economic conditions in the pacific rim countries 
the growth in occurred in the last three quarters of  with revenues contracting in the first quarter of the growth in revenues in was attributable to market growth internationally as revenues derived internationally grew by  while revenues derived from customers in north america declined by 
the growth in occurred in the first two quarters of  with revenues contracting in the last two quarters of see selected quarterly results below 
unit volumes of sinterstation systems and most powdered materials increased during and as stated above  the company s international revenues were million  or  of total revenues  compared to and of total revenues in and  respectively 
germany was the only foreign country from which more than of the company s revenues were derived 
revenues derived from german customers amounted to  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
except for sales occuring in germany  japan and the united kingdom  the company s international revenues were primarily denominated in u 
s 
dollars 
the company does not hedge all of its foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on exchange transactions and translation of foreign operations did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results in any period 
however  in and dtm did experience downward pressure on its international prices as the us dollar strengthened significantly against most european and asian currencies 
if this strengthening continues  the company expects continued downward pressure on the company s sales prices in the international markets 
revenues in past periods may not be indicative of revenues in the future  which may be affected by other business environment and risk factors previously discussed  as well as other factors included elsewhere herein 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or  of revenue  in  compared to million  or  and million  or  of total revenues in and  respectively 
the gross profit increases in and were due to sequentially higher worldwide unit volume each year 
the gross margin percentage increases in and were affected primarily by a product mix shift toward powdered materials  including increased volumes of nylon powders 
the gross margin would have been had it not been depressed by an inventory write off of  in the second quarter of caused by new product introductions 
the gross margin improved to in the fourth quarter of  reflecting a full quarter shipment of the new sinterstation plus 
the service and support gross margin in returned to levels  primarily due to reduced travel costs of servicing certain international customers as a result of using more on site employees 
the company believes there is a risk that gross margin percentages may decline in the face of the strong us dollar 
other factors  including changes in material and labor costs  may also have an adverse effect on gross margins 
past gross margins are not necessarily indicative of future gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense was million or of revenues in  compared to million or of revenues and million or of revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in both and in was primarily related to the increased costs associated with sales and sales support staffs and commission expense resulting from higher sales levels 
selling  general and administrative expense may vary as a percentage of revenues in the future 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased by to million in  from million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense was  and in  and  respectively 
the higher expense levels were  primarily  due to initial design and prototype cost associated with multiple significant new product development projects that were commenced in and culminated in with the introduction of several new material systems and the new sinterstation model plus 
the company plans to continue its commitment to research and development in  as the company believes that the markets for its products are characterized by technological innovation for hardware  software and powdered materials 
research and development expense may increase in absolute dollars in future periods  and such expenditures may vary as a percentage of sales 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors 
provision for litigation settlement 
in  dtm settled the shareholder class action lawsuit pending against it 
the charge to its second quarter statement of operations in the amount of million  consisted of million  the proposed value of the settlement  and  in other costs  net of the insurance recovery of million 
see item of quarterly report on form q for the period ended june   filed on august  stock compensation eap 
in connection with the ipo  the company incurred a one time non cash stock compensation expense of approximately million as a result of previously outstanding stock appreciation rights converting by formula into immediately vested stock options at exercise prices below the market value of the common stock 
this charge was recorded in the second quarter of interest expense 
net interest expense for was  a decrease of  compared to interest expense of  for and million for this reflects the decrease in the average daily balance of the company s outstanding indebtedness stemming from the repayment of substantially all outstanding indebtedness in may from the proceeds of the ipo 
gain on sale of assets 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the company sold used sinterstation model and model systems under a previously announced program to sell systems that had been used internally for development and support activities or under a discontinued rental program 
the company recognized a net gain of  on those sales in cost of discontinued registration 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expensed  of legal  accounting and other professional services related to an attempted initial public offering  which was commenced in and postponed 
income taxes 
as a result of its tax sharing arrangement with bfgoodrich  its then controlling shareholder  the company was allocated an income tax benefit of  in and million in in may  bfgoodrich s ownership interest fell below and such benefits were no longer available to the company 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded the final accounting for this tax allocation arrangement 
net loss 
the company had net losses  excluding special charges  of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million decrease in net loss from to was primarily due to increased product and service revenues  improved gross margins on sinterstation systems  reduced research and development expense  reduced interest expense and gains from the sale of internally used sinterstation systems 
operating results for included a special charge of million for the estimated cost of settling the shareholder class action litigation and  of an inventory write off relating to new product introductions 
the operating results for were adversely affected by a special charge of million arising from the conversion of stock appreciation rights by dtm employees in connection with the company s ipo in may additionally  operating results for were benefited from  of tax credits allocated from the company s parent 
the allocation of income tax benefits ended with the company s ipo in may net loss  including special charges  for was million  compared to million in and million in selected quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for the three month periods ended march  through december  this information has been presented on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes

liquidity and capital resources during  operating activities used million in net cash  compared to a use for such purposes of million in and million in the cash flows from operating activities would have been positive had it not been for settlement and legal expenditures of million on the two lawsuits that were settled in in  inventory levels and collection cycles returned to normal levels from the higher levels experienced in as result of a soft north american market 
accounts receivable  less allowance  represented approximately days of quarter sales at december   compared to days at december  inventory  less allowance  represented approximately days on hand at december   compared to at december  the company s investing activities include expenditures for patents and licenses  capitalized software costs and furniture and equipment  principally consisting of the company s sinterstation systems built for internal use and rental purposes 
capital expenditures for of million included the first quarter acquisition of  of sinterstation plus systems for internal use in support of the new platform and older models for support and a now discontinued rental program 
in the third quarter  the company recognized  in proceeds from the sale of the previously mentioned sinterstation plus systems to a leasing company and then leased them back under an operating lease 
the sale leaseback transaction for the sinterstation plus systems represents off balance sheet financing that will be partially repaid over the next two years 
operating expenses for the next two years are not significantly affected by this sale leaseback transaction 
also in the third and fourth quarters of  the company recognized  in proceeds from the sale to customers of older model sinterstation systems that had been used internally or in the rental program 
thus after these transactions  net cash used by investing activities was approximately  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  the company has planned for approximately  in capital expenditures 
this includes an additional sinterstation plus system to support the new platform and year compliance expenditures 
the company intends to fund this additional investment from operations as well as from any proceeds from the sale of older model internally used systems 
the company continues to market its refurbished model program 
any income resulting from these sales will be recognized as proceeds from the sale of assets 
at december   the company had a million line of credit with chase bank  texas na  expiring in april at december   there were no amounts outstanding on this line of credit 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at prime minus and were guaranteed by bfgoodrich  the then controlling shareholder 
due to the change in control of the company that occurred on february   this credit line is no longer available to dtm 
on february   the company received a commitment from a bank to replace the line of credit with a temporary spot factoring line while it negotiates a permanent line of credit 
at december   the company s only indebtedness was its advance from bfgoodrich in the amount of  in connection with the february  change in control  proactive  the new shareholder  informed the company that it had acquired the company s liability to bfgoodrich in the amount of approximately  this liability is currently non interest bearing and is due on demand 
proactive has informed the company that it intends to require formalization of this indebtedness on commercial terms 
the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet business requirements  including capital expenditures  working capital requirements  the debt obligations outstanding and operating lease commitments for facilities and equipment through december  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
effect of inflation the company s business operations are subject to inflationary pressures 
due to the competitive environment in this industry  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase prices in the event of increased labor and material costs 
new accounting standard in june  the accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company has not yet determined what the effect of statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
will be on its earnings and financial position and has not yet determined the timing or method of adoption 
however  the statement could increase volatility in earnings and comprehensive income 
year plan many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in date code fields 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company has evaluated its sinterstation systems and believes that it will have no exposures with respect to the year issue 
the company has begun to develop a plan to upgrade or replace its internal information technology to comply with year requirements and begun to evaluate packaged software solutions to assess year compliance 
the company currently expects this compliance project to be substantially completed by mid and to cost between  and  this estimate includes internal costs  but excludes the costs to upgrade and replace systems in the normal course of business 
the company does not expect this project to have a significant effect on its operations 
as of december   approximately  has been expensed 
such expenses are being funded through operating cash flows 
in a worst case scenario  the company believes its information systems might not properly account for amounts due from customers or due to suppliers at the end of and the preparation of its financial statements may be delayed 
the company has performed an evaluation of its non information systems embedded technology such as microcontrollers and does not believe that it has significant exposures in this area with respect to the year issue 
the company has not made inquiries of its key vendors as to their status with respect to the year compliance issues 
there can be no assurance that year compliance issues at these vendors may not cause these vendors to disrupt the company s production plans 
based upon available information  the company does not believe any material exposure to significant business interruption exists as a result of year compliance issues  or that the cost of the remedial actions will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
accordingly  the company has not adopted any formal contingency plan in the event its year compliance project is not completed in a timely manner 
the estimates and conclusions set forth herein regarding year compliance contain certain forward looking statements and are based on management s estimates of future events and information provided by third parties 
there can be no assurance that such estimates and information provided will prove to be accurate 
risks to completing the year compliance project include the availability of resources  the company s ability to discover and correct potential year problems and the ability of suppliers and other third parties to bring their systems into year compliance 
risk factors that may affect future results and safe harbor statement investors are cautioned that this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the following i the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations and intentions are subject to change at any time at the discretion of management and the board of directors  ii the company s plans and results of operations will be affected by the company s ability to manage its growth and working capital  iii the company s business is highly competitive and the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of the operations by existing competitors in the company s markets could adversely affect the company s plans and results of operations 
in addition  the company identifies the risk factors discussed below which may affect the company s actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
limited operating history and lack of profitability the company was incorporated in and shipped its first sinterstation systems in the company only became profitable in the fourth quarter of prior to the fourth quarter of  the company had been unprofitable from its inception  most recently recognizing net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the nine months ended september  there can be no assurance that the company can achieve  or if it achieves  maintain  profitability in the future 
possible delisting of securities from the nasdaq national market  limited liquidity of trading market shares of the company s common stock are quoted on the national market system nms of the nasdaq stock market nasdaq 
nasdaq has recently promulgated new rules that make continued listing of companies on the nms more difficult and has significantly increased its enforcement efforts with regard to the nasdaq standards for such listing 
the company has been having difficulty maintaining one such standard  the million market value of public float requirement 
public float is defined for purposes of this calculation as shares that are not held directly or indirectly by any officer or director of the company or any person who is the beneficial owner of more than percent of the total shares outstanding 
on march   the company s public float was believed to be no less than  shares of common stock and the minimum bid price was per share 
this resulted in a market value of public float of million 
the company plans to seek an appeal of any attempt by nasdaq to delist the company s securities 
however  there can be no assurance that such an appeal would be successful and  therefore  that the company could avoid having its securities delisted 
in addition  nasdaq also requires companies whose stock is included for quotation on the nms maintain  in net tangible assets and a minimum bid price of 
as of december   the company had net tangible assets of  for such purpose 
however  during the fourth quarter of  the company failed to maintain a minimum bid price of 
while the company believes it is currently in compliance with these standards  if the company fails to continue to satisfy these requirements  its common stock may be delisted from the nms 
if the company is delisted from the nms  it may choose to list its common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market  the otc bulletin board or some other quotation medium  such as the pink sheets  depending on its ability to meet the specific listing requirements 
if the company is delisted from the nms  it is unlikely that the company would be able to have its common stock included for quotation on the nasdaq smallcap market 
as a result  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of  the company s common stock 
additionally  if the company s common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange or on nasdaq  it may be subject to so called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice and market making requirements on broker dealers who sell or make a market in such securities 
consequently  the delisting of the company s common stock from the nms could adversely affect the ability or willingness of broker dealers who sell or make a market in the company s common stock and the ability of investors of the company s common stock to sell their securities in the secondary market 
such delisting may also have the adverse effect of reducing the visibility  liquidity and prestige of the company s common stock 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional financing  possibility of significant dilution the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including its profitability  growth rate  working capital requirements  expenses associated with protection of its patents and other intellectual property and costs of future research and development activities 
developing technology companies such as dtm typically need large amounts of capital to fund growth 
however  the company s cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned as a result of unforeseen changes that could consume a significant portion of the available resources before that time 
future operating results will depend  in part  on the company s ability to obtain and manage capital sufficient to finance its business 
to the extent that funds expected to be generated from the company s operations are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements or to maintain its listing on the nasdaq nms  the company will seek to obtain additional funds through bank facilities  equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and others from other sources 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay or to eliminate certain expenditures or to license to third parties the rights to commercialize technologies that the company would otherwise seek to develop itself 
in addition  in the event that the company obtains any additional funding  such financing may have a substantially dilutive effect on the holders of the company s securities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources quarterly fluctuations in operating results the company s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and may continue to do so 
dtm typically experiences a relatively long lead time  often from six to months  to complete a sinterstation system sale and has historically experienced no backlog 
furthermore  new product introductions  seasonality of customer buying patterns and other factors can cause fluctuations in quarterly results 
these fluctuations have precluded  and may continue to preclude  the company from managing its inventories effectively from quarter to quarter 
further  a majority of the sales of the company s sinterstation systems occur at the end of the quarter  often in the last weeks of the quarter 
accordingly  the company s ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is limited  and the deferral or loss of one or more significant sales could materially adversely affect operating results in a particular quarter 
the current week manufacturing cycle of the new sinterstation system model plus negatively impacts the company s ability to control its inventories 
the failure of the company to complete a particular sinterstation system sale in any given quarter can have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance for that quarter and quarterly fluctuations could cause a material adverse effect on the price at which the company s common stock trades 
the tendency for a large number of the company s sales made during a quarter to be completed at or near the end of the quarter also hinders the company s ability to predict sales  control sales prices and enforce its standard terms 
emerging rapid protyping market the market for rapid prototyping products and services  such as those marketed by the company  is in an early stage of development and includes multiple  competing technologies  many of which are not yet fully developed 
participants in this market are moving to address new applications  many of which may not yet be known or accepted by potential users 
rapid prototyping requires that a cad file describe a design 
organizations who are not using cad are not  generally  potential customers for rapid prototyping products and services 
significant education of the end user in both cad modeling and rapid prototyping in general has in some cases been a prerequisite to product acceptance 
it is not clear at this time which one or more technologies will gain broad market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that dtm will emerge as a market leader  or even a major market participant  as the market evolves and matures 
emerging rapid tooling market the market for rapid tooling products and services  such as those marketed by the company  is in an even earlier stage of development than rapid prototyping 
participants in this market  including the company  are moving to address new applications  many of which may not yet be known or accepted by potential users 
the companies who use traditional machining methods to make tooling have made large capital investments in traditional equipment and have mature infrastructures for doing so 
they may be highly resistant both on financial and cultural bases to adopting new technologies 
there can be no assurance that rapid tooling technologies will evolve to the point that the perceived value will overcome those obstacles 
there can be no assurance that dtm will emerge as a market leader  or even a major market participant  as the market evolves and matures 
competition the market for rapid prototyping systems is intensely competitive 
in marketing its sinterstation systems  the company experiences competition from many sources 
certain of the company s competitors are better known and have greater financial  research and development  production and marketing resources than dtm 
the principal worldwide competitors are d systems corporation and stratasys  inc eos gmbh is a significant competitor outside of north america 
competition has increased as a result of the introduction of new products or product enhancements by these competitors and the entry into the industry by other companies 
increased competition has in the past resulted  and may in the future continue to result  in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which have materially adversely affected the company s business and financial results 
limited product company the company currently offers one model of sinterstation systems for sale 
the sale of sinterstation systems comprised of revenues in the year ended december  and of revenues in each of the years ended december  and the remaining revenues were comprised of sales of powdered sintering materials  spare parts and services to the installed base of sinterstation owners 
sinterstation systems are priced at the premium end of the range of today s rapid prototyping products and are sold on the basis of performance and suitability to specific applications 
in a downturn or a soft market  the company s dependence upon a limited range of products  as opposed to a wide range of products at different price points  has caused the company s financial performance to be adversely affected and may continue to do so 
intellectual property and proprietary rights in pursuing protection for its proprietary rights in its sinterstation systems  materials and related technology  the company currently relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  as well as contractual provisions 
the company typically seeks patent protection for its selective laser sintering technology  including  where deemed appropriate  the selective laser sintering process  its sinterstation systems and the materials used in its sinterstation systems 
however  patent protection may not always be available 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued under any or all of the patent applications to which the company has rights 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition  the company can give no assurance that the issued patents to which it holds rights will be adequate to protect its interests or  if challenged  held valid 
the company s competitors could develop non infringing systems  materials or technologies that are equivalent or superior to those of the company 
a competitor currently does and others also may practice technology covered by dtm s patents or other legal or contractual protections regardless of the fact that it is legally protected 
any litigation to enforce the company s intellectual property rights would be expensive  time consuming  may divert management resources and may not be adequate to protect the company s business 
while dtm defends its intellectual property vigorously  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in its various litigation in many countries 
if the company were unsuccessful in enforcing its intellectual property rights or other contractual rights in the context of third party offers to sell selective laser sintering systems or sintering powders or if the company were found to have violated state or federal antitrust laws  the company s future revenues might be adversely affected 
for example  a court granted a temporary summary judgment against the company in  ruling that a customer had been given an implied personal license by dtm to one of dtm s patented sintering materials 
although the summary judgment was stayed in connection with a settlement agreement in this case  there can be no assurance that intellectual property claims against the company in the future will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial performance and results of operations 
furthermore  unrelated third parties hold many patents and pending patent applications under which the company is not a licensee that relate to the design and manufacture of rapid prototyping systems and materials 
if such a third party brought infringement litigation against the company  and if the company was not successful in defending such litigation or in obtaining a license  the company s business and financial performance could be materially adversely affected 
the company has been threatened with such litigation by a competitor 
certain key intellectual property used in the selective laser sintering process is licensed to the company by the university of texas system 
as a licensee  the company s rights to practice the technology are not absolute 
the university of texas could terminate  attempt to terminate or amend the license if the company could be shown to be in material default of the terms of the license 
even if dtm has a basis for objection  defense of its rights as a licensee could be costly and the outcome would be uncertain 
loss of significant rights as a licensee under this license could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a substantial extent on a relatively few key management employees
