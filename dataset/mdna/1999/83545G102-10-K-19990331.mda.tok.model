item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview sonic is one of the top five automotive retailers in the united states  operating dealerships and collision repair centers in the southeastern  southwestern and midwestern united states 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  sells replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services and arrange related f i for its automotive customers 
our business is geographically diverse  with dealership operations in the atlanta  charlotte  chattanooga  columbus  daytona beach  greenville spartanburg  houston  montgomery  nashville  and tampa clearwater markets 
sonic sells domestic and foreign brands  which consist of acura  bmw  cadillac  chevrolet  chrysler  dodge  ford  honda  hyundai  infiniti  isuzu  jeep  kia  lincoln  mercedes  mercury  mitsubishi  oldsmobile  plymouth  subaru  toyota  volkswagen and volvo 
new vehicle revenues include both the sale and lease of new vehicles 
used vehicle revenues include amounts received for used vehicles sold to retail customers  other dealers and wholesalers 
other operating revenues include parts and services revenues  fees and commissions for arranging f i and sales of third party extended warranties for vehicles 
in connection with vehicle financing contracts  sonic receives a finance fee from the lender for originating the loan 
if  within days of origination  the customer pays off the loans through refinancing or selling trading in the vehicle or defaults on the loan  the finance company will assess a charge a chargeback for a portion of the original commission 
the amount of the chargeback depends on how long the related loan was outstanding 
as a result  sonic has established reserves based on its historical chargeback experience 
sonic also sells warranties provided by third party vendors  and recognizes a commission at the time of sale 
while the automotive retailing business is cyclical  we sell several products and services that are not closely tied to the sale of new and used vehicles 
such products and services include our parts and service and collision repair businesses  both of which are not dependent upon near term new vehicle sales volume 
our cost of sales and profitability are also affected by the allocations of new vehicles which our dealerships receive from manufacturers 
when we do not receive allocations of new vehicle models adequate to meet customer demand  we may purchase additional vehicles from other dealers at a premium to the manufacturer s invoice  reducing the gross margin realized on the sales of such vehicles 
in addition  we follow a disciplined approach in selling vehicles to other dealers and wholesalers when the vehicles have been in our inventory longer than the guidelines set by us 
such sales are frequently at or below cost and  therefore  reduce our overall gross margin on vehicle sales 
sonic s salary expense  employee benefits costs and advertising expenses comprise the majority of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
sonic s interest expense fluctuates based primarily on the level of the inventory of new vehicles held at our dealerships  substantially all of which is financed through floor plan financing  as well as the amount of indebtedness incurred for acquisitions 
we have accounted for all of our dealership acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  we do not include in our financial statements the results of operations of these dealerships prior to the date they were acquired by us 
the consolidated financial statements of sonic discussed below reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of each of our dealerships acquired prior to december  as a result of the effects of our acquisitions  the historical consolidated financial information described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of sonic in the future or the results of operations  financial position and cash flows which would have resulted had such acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the automobile industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns  characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
many factors affect the industry including general economic conditions and consumer confidence  the level of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit 
sonic s profit margins are primarily impacted by changes in the percentage of revenues attributed to new vehicle sales 
results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods presented  the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in sonic s statement of operations 
percentage of total revenues for year ended december  revenues new vehicle sales used vehicle sales parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative operating income interest expense income before taxes twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues 
revenues grew in each of sonic s primary revenue areas for as compared with  causing total revenues to increase to billion 
this increase was due primarily to revenues contributed by our acquisitions completed in and of approximately million 
new vehicle sales revenue increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in new vehicle unit sales of to  as compared with  in resulting principally from  units contributed by the acquisitions completed during and the remainder of the increase was due to a increase in the average selling price of new vehicles resulting principally from sales of higher priced luxury and import vehicles contributed by sonic s acquisitions 
used vehicle revenues from retail sales increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in used vehicle unit sales of to  as compared with  in  resulting from additional unit sales contributed by the acquisitions completed in and the remainder of the increase was due to a increase in the average selling price of used vehicles  resulting principally from sales of higher priced luxury and import vehicles contributed by our acquisitions  along with an increase in used vehicle revenues from stores owned for longer than one year of in over sonic s parts  service and collision repair revenue increased to million in compared to million in  due principally to our acquisitions 
finance and insurance revenue increased million  or  due principally to increased new vehicle sales and related financing contributed by the acquisitions completed in and gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in due principally to increases in revenues contributed by our acquisitions 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to from due to increases in new vehicle gross margins from to resulting from sales of higher margin import vehicles contributed by our acquisitions  as well as improved gross margins of used vehicles from to resulting from efforts made to improve management of used vehicle inventories 
in addition  because gross margins from used vehicle revenues are higher than gross margins from new vehicle revenues  an increase in used vehicle revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  and a decrease in new vehicle revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  also contributed to the overall increase in gross profits as a percentage of total revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased to million in from million in such expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to from due principally to expenses inherent with the rapid growth and formation of sonic 
in addition  because sales compensation  which comprises over of total selling  general  and administration expenses  is based on gross profits as opposed to revenues  the increase in gross profit margins resulted in an increase in total selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues 
interest expense  floor plan 
interest expense  floor plan increased to million from million  due primarily to floor plan interest incurred by our acquisitions 
as a percentage of total revenues  floor plan interest decreased from to due to decreased interest rates under sonic s floor plan financing arrangements  as well as improvement in turnover rates

new vehicle sales revenue increased to million  compared with million 
new vehicle unit sales increased from  to  accounting for of the increase in vehicle sales revenues 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to a increase in the average selling price resulting from changes in vehicle prices  particularly a shift in customer preference to higher cost light trucks and sport utility vehicles  and additional revenues from our acquisitions 
used vehicle revenues from retail sales increased from million in to million in the increase in used vehicle revenues was due principally to additional revenues contributed from dealerships acquired in the fourth quarter of sonic s parts  service and collision repair revenue increased to million from million  and declined as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increase in service and parts revenue was due principally to increased parts revenue  including wholesale parts  from our lone star ford and fort mill ford locations and additional revenues from our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of f i revenue increased million  due principally to increased new vehicle sales and related financings 
gross profit 
gross profit increased in to million from million in due to increases in new vehicle sales revenues principally at our lone star ford and fort mill ford locations and additional revenues from our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarter of parts and service revenue increases also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased from million to million 
these expenses increased due to increases in sales volume as well as expenses inherent with the initial growth and formation of sonic 
interest expense  floor plan 
interest expense  floor plan increased to million from million  primarily due to our acquisitions 
as a percentage of total revenues  floor plan interest decreased from to 
interest expense  other 
interest expense  other increased from million to million 
the increase in interest expense was due to interest incurred on acquisition related indebtedness 
net income 
as a result of the factors noted above  sonic s net income increased by million in compared to liquidity and capital resources sonic s principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions  and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under its various credit facilities  and borrowings and capital contributions from our stockholders to finance our operations and expansion 
on november   sonic completed its initial public offering of its class a common stock  providing approximately million of additional capital resources for the consummation of certain acquisitions 
on july   sonic completed its private placement of million of its senior subordinated notes which provided an additional million of capital resources for the consummation of certain acquisitions  for repayment of borrowings under our revolving line of credit and for future acquisitions 
sonic currently has a standardized floor plan credit facility with ford motor credit for all its dealership subsidiaries the floor plan facility used to finance purchases of new and used vehicle inventory 
as of december   there was an aggregate of million outstanding under the floor plan facility 
the floor plan facility at december  had an effective rate of prime less subject to certain incentives and other adjustments 
typically new vehicle floor plan indebtedness exceeds the related inventory balances 
the inventory balances are generally reduced by the manufacturer s purchase discounts which are not reflected in the related floor plan liability 
these manufacturer purchase discounts are standard in the industry  typically occur on all new vehicle purchases  and are not used to offset the related floor plan liability 
these discounts are aggregated and generally paid to sonic by the manufacturer on a quarterly basis 
the related floor plan liability becomes due as vehicles are sold 
the floor plan facility includes an available credit line for the purchase of used vehicle inventory 
sonic s general practice is to utilize used vehicle floor plan indebtedness only when purchasing large quantities of used vehicles in bulk 
as of december   there was approximately million available under sonic s used vehicle credit line of which approximately million was unused 
amounts outstanding under used floor plan indebtedness are due when vehicles are sold 
sonic makes monthly interest payments on the amount financed under the floor plan facility but is not required to make loan principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
the underlying notes are due when the related vehicles are sold and are collateralized by vehicle inventories and other assets of the relevant dealership subsidiary 
the floor plan facility contains a number of covenants  including among others  covenants restricting sonic with respect to the creation of liens and changes in ownership  officers and key management personnel 
sonic generated net cash of million from operating activities in  compared to million in the increase was attributable principally to increased net income and decreases in inventory levels 
cash used for investing activities  excluding amounts paid in acquisitions  was approximately million for the year ended december  and related primarily to acquisitions of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  including million  million and million of capital expenditures during such periods 
sonic s principal capital expenditures typically include building improvements and equipment for use in our dealerships 
of the capital expenditures in  million related to the construction of new dealerships and a body shop which upon completion is expected to be sold to an affiliate of mmrt and subsequently leased back 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in primarily reflected proceeds received from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes  plus borrowings under our revolving credit facility with ford motor credit the revolving facility  less repayments of other debt 
the purpose of these borrowings was to finance acquisitions in the revolving facility with ford motor credit currently has a borrowing limit of million 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility bear interest at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to above the month commercial finance paper rate as reported by the federal reserve board at december  
the revolving facility will mature in march  unless sonic requests that such term be extended  at the option of ford motor credit  for a number of additional one year terms to be negotiated by the parties 
no assurance can be given that such extensions will be granted 
on july   all amounts previously outstanding under the revolving facility were repaid with a portion of the net proceeds of the sale of senior subordinated notes 
the outstanding balance of million at december  represents amounts borrowed to finance certain of sonic s acquisitions completed in amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of march  total approximately million which reflects additional borrowings used to finance certain acquisitions closed subsequent to december  additional amounts to be drawn under the revolving facility are to be used for the acquisition of additional dealerships and to provide general working capital needs of sonic not to exceed million 
we agreed under the revolving facility not to pledge any of our assets to any third party with the exception of currently encumbered real estate and assets of sonic s dealership subsidiaries that are subject to previous pledges or liens 
in addition  the revolving facility contains certain negative covenants  including covenants restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends  capital expenditures and material dispositions of assets as well as other customary covenants 
additional negative covenants include specified ratios of o total debt to tangible base capital as defined in the revolving facility  o current assets to current liabilities  o earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and rent less capital expenditures to fixed charges  o ebitda to interest expense  o ebitda to total debt and o the current lending commitment under the revolving facility to scaled assets as defined in the revolving facility 
in addition  the loss of voting control over sonic by bruton smith  scott smith and their spouses or immediate family members or the failure by sonic  with certain exceptions  to own all the outstanding equity  membership or partnership interests in its dealership subsidiaries will constitute an event of default under the revolving facility 
sonic did not meet the specified total debt to tangible equity ratios required by the revolving facility at march  and at june  and obtained a waiver with regard to such requirement from ford motor credit 
in connection with sonic s offering of its senior subordinated notes  sonic and ford motor credit amended the revolving facility to provide that the senior subordinated notes which are subordinated to the revolving facility will be treated as equity capital for purposes of this ratio 
accordingly  sonic was in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants as of december  on july   sonic completed its private placement of its senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of  the notes are unsecured  mature on august   and are redeemable at sonic s option after august  interest payments are due semi annually on february and august  commencing february  the notes are subordinated to all present and future senior indebtedness of sonic  including the revolving facility 
redemption prices during month periods beginning august are in  in  in and thereafter 
net proceeds after commissions and discounts  including issuance discount of  amounted to  and were used to finance certain of our acquisitions and to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving facility 
on december   sonic completed an exchange offer to exchange the senior subordinated notes for identical senior subordinated notes registered under the securities act 
the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contains certain specified restrictive and required financial covenants 
we have agreed not to pledge our assets to any third party except under certain limited circumstances for example  floor plan indebtedness 
we also have agreed to certain other limitations or prohibitions concerning the incurrence of other indebtedness  capital stock  guaranties  asset sales  investments  cash dividends to shareholders  distributions and redemptions 
under sonic s amended and restated certificate of incorporation  million shares of preferred stock are authorized to be issued by sonic with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
in march  our board of directors designated  shares of preferred stock as class a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock  which was divided into  shares of series i preferred stock   shares of series ii preferred stock and  shares of series iii preferred stock 
the preferred stock has a liquidation preference of  per share 
each share of preferred stock is convertible  at the option of the holder  into that number of shares of class a common stock as is determined by dividing  by the average closing price for the class a common stock on the nyse for the days preceding the date of determination of the shares of preferred stock the market price 
conversion of series ii preferred stock is subject to certain adjustments which have the effect of limiting increases and decreases in the value of the class a common stock receivable upon conversion by of the original value of the shares of series ii preferred stock 
conversion of series iii preferred stock is subject to certain adjustments which have the effect of limiting increases in the value of class a common stock receivable upon conversion by of the original value of the shares of series iii preferred stock 
the preferred stock is redeemable at sonic s option at any time after the date of issuance 
the redemption price of the series i preferred stock is  per share 
the redemption price for the series ii preferred stock and series iii preferred stock is as follows i prior to the second anniversary of the date of issuance  the redemption price is the greater of  per share or the aggregate market price of the class a common stock into which it could be converted at the time of redemption  and ii after the second anniversary of the date of issuance  the redemption price is the aggregate market price of the class a common stock into which it could be converted at the time of redemption 
each share of preferred stock entitles its holder to a number of votes equal to that number of shares of class a common stock into which it could be converted as of the record date for the vote 
holders of preferred stock are entitled to participate in dividends payable on the class a common stock on an as if converted basis 
the preferred stock has no preferential dividends 
during  sonic acquired dealerships for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the aggregate purchase price was paid with approximately million in cash  with  shares of class a common stock having an estimated fair value at the time of issuance of approximately million  with  shares of preferred stock  shares of series i preferred stock   shares of series ii preferred stock  and  shares of series iii preferred stock having an estimated fair value at the time of issuance of approximately million and with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock having an approximate fair value of million 
the cash portion of the aggregate purchase price was financed with a combination of cash obtained from the net proceeds of sonic s private offering on july  of million in aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes  cash obtained from the revolving facility  and cash generated from sonic s existing operations 
in addition  sonic has issued to the sellers of certain of the acquired dealerships warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock having an approximate fair value of million 
payables for acquisitions as of december  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet includes million of the cash portion of the aggregate purchase price which was paid subsequent to december  the difference between the aggregate purchase price of million and amounts paid of represents the net of i million due from a former owner as a result of a shortage in the actual net book value of assets acquired compared to the minimum net book value required in the purchase agreement  ii million due to a former owner as a result of an excess in the actual net book value of assets acquired over the minimum net book value required in the purchase agreement  and iii million due to a former owner on the first and second anniversaries of the acquisition date 
the million due from a former owner has been included in other current assets on the accompanying balance sheet 
the million and million due to former owners have been included in payable for acquisitions on the accompanying balance sheet 
in accordance with terms of certain of the purchase agreements  sonic may be required to pay additional consideration contingent upon future earnings of certain of the dealerships acquired 
as of december   sonic had recorded approximately million relating to such consideration  which has been accounted for as goodwill 
any additional amounts which may be payable in the future will also be accounted for as goodwill 
during the first quarter of  sonic acquired dealerships for approximately million in cash and  shares of series iii preferred stock having a liquidation preference of  per share 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed with a combination of cash borrowed under the revolving facility and cash generated from sonic s existing operations 
the acquisitions were accounted for using purchase accounting 
sonic may be required to pay additional amounts based on pre tax earnings of certain of the dealerships acquired 
any additional amounts paid will be accounted for as goodwill 
in connection with the subsequent acquisition of a honda dealership located in chattanooga  tennessee in march  sonic sold substantially all of the assets of its honda dealership in cleveland  tennessee for approximately million 
sonic has signed definitive agreements to acquire dealerships for a minimum of approximately million in cash   shares of series ii preferred stock and  shares of series iii preferred stock having a liquidation value of  per share 
the aggregate purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the actual net book value of the assets acquired 
the cash portion of the purchase price will be paid with a combination of borrowings under the revolving facility and with cash generated from sonic s existing operations 
sonic may be required to pay additional amounts based on future pre tax earnings of certain of these acquired dealerships 
these acquisitions are expected to be consummated in the second and third quarters of sonic incurred a tax liability of approximately million in connection with the change in its tax basis of accounting for inventory from the last in  first out method of inventory accounting to the first in  first out method of inventory accounting  which is payable over a six year period beginning in january in addition  in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we incurred an additional tax liability in the amount of approximately million as a result of the change in accounting for the inventory from the last in  first out method of inventory accounting to the first in  first out method of inventory accounting  which will be payable over a four year period 
as of december   the remaining cumulative balance of this tax liability was million 
we expect to pay such obligation with cash provided by operations 
we believe that the net proceeds from the sale of the senior subordinated notes  together with funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our floor plan financing or any replacements thereof and our other credit arrangements will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth  for the foreseeable future 
sonic expects to fund any future acquisitions from its future cash flow from operations  additional debt financing including the revolving facility or the issuance of class a common stock  preferred stock or other convertible instruments 
seasonality sonic s operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first quarter generally contributes less revenue and operating profits than the second  third and fourth quarters 
seasonality is principally caused by weather conditions and the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers 
year compliance general due to the limited memory capacity of older computers  many computer systems and software applications in earlier years were programmed to store dates using six digit formats eg mm dd yy versus nine digit formats eg mm dd yyyy 
under the six digit format  most computer systems and software applications are limited to recognizing dates within the th century only  causing computers to interpret the year as the year rather than the year as we approach the beginning of year  there is widespread concern that the inability of computer systems to recognize dates beyond the year will result in software errors and system failures that could be disruptive to ordinary business operations 
we recognize the need to ensure that our operations will not be disrupted by year yk system failures either within our own computer systems or within the computer systems of our primary lenders and suppliers 
each of our dealerships has appointed a team comprised primarily of department managers that  using guides developed by the national automobile dealers association nada  is responsible for assessing and resolving potential year problems  and developing contingency plans to mitigate the impact of future problems on operations 
state of readiness internal dealership systems internal systems supporting the dealership s daily operations are comprised of four primary systems i the dealer management system dms  which supports the critical operations of the dealership including all vehicle sales  vehicle inventory  financing and insurance operations  service and parts operations  and accounting functions  ii the dealer communication system dcs  which provides on line communication with manufacturers necessary for ordering vehicles and parts inventory  submitting warranty claims  submitting dealership financial statements  receiving delivery reports  and receiving technical information used in service department operations  iii personal computer systems pc systems used in providing information to and communicating with the parent company  and iv embedded systems which use an electric processor or computer chip to control  monitor  or assist with the operation of equipment  machinery  and building management eg building access  security and fire alarms  automotive diagnostic equipment 
dealer management system the dms systems used by our dealerships are obtained from one of four primary vendors reynolds reynolds  infiniti net  adp and ucs 
each of these vendors has developed upgrades to correct yk problems within the dms systems  and we have completed the process of installing such upgrades to our systems 
in addition  we have received written verification from each of these vendors that the dms systems operating within dealerships currently owned by sonic are yk certified 
with respect to dealerships being acquired  dealerships using dms systems which are not yk certified are being transferred to existing systems which are yk certified 
dealer communication system the dcs systems used in our dealerships are provided by the respective manufacturers with whom the dealerships communicate 
as a result  the manufacturers have assumed responsibility for upgrading dcs systems to yk compliant systems 
to date  all but of our dealerships have received written verification from their respective manufacturer that their dcs system is yk compliant 
in addition  we have requested from each manufacturer that status reports be provided to both the dealership and parent company to inform us of remediation efforts at those dealerships that are not yet yk compliant  and when such remediation efforts are expected to be completed 
personal computer systems most pc systems currently operating in our dealerships were installed within the past year and were determined to be yk compliant at the time of installation 
pc systems and local and wide area networks used to communicate with our dealerships were also recently installed  and were yk certified upon purchase 
as a precautionary measure  we have provided all dealerships with diskettes containing programs designed to test pc systems for yk capability 
all pc systems that have not met certification standards for compliance will be upgraded or replaced with systems that are yk compliant 
embedded systems embedded systems refer to systems that use some sort of electronic process or computer chip to track time and date information used in the operation of that system 
for example  security systems  or heating  ventilation  and air conditioning systems hvac may be programmed to automatically be activated or deactivated at a certain time 
if a security system is programmed to lock up a dealership on weekends  then some dealerships may be locked out on thursday  january  because the computer interprets the date as saturday  january  all facilities are currently conducting an inventory of such systems  and will contact the manufacturer or supplier to test such systems and obtain verification of yk certification 
this process has not yet been completed  though these systems are not considered critical and a disruption in these systems is not expected to significantly affect dealerships daily operations 
external systems a dealership s operations may be adversely affected if the lenders  suppliers  or other third parties with whom it regularly conducts business are affected by yk problems within their systems 
other than automobile manufacturers  we are primarily concerned about yk failures with banks and other financial service providers  companies providing financing and insurance to our customers  and utilities providing electricity and water 
we have received verification from our primary banks and lenders that their systems are yk compliant and that service is not expected to be interrupted by yk problems 
we are still in the process of contacting other key vendors and suppliers regarding their yk remediation efforts 
costs the costs associated with converting our internal systems to yk compliant systems have not been  and are not expected to be  material to our financial position or results of operations 
costs associated with upgrading and converting the dms and dcs systems to yk compliant systems were covered by monthly maintenance contracts with the respective suppliers and were expensed as incurred 
costs associated with upgrading or replacing pc and embedded systems have not been material and were expensed or capitalized in accordance with our capitalization policy 
contingency plans we cannot state with certainty whether year system failures either within our own internal systems or within the systems of third parties with whom we are involved will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in order to mitigate the potential impact of any future year problems  each of our dealerships is in the process of developing contingency plans which include the following use of pre printed and pre numbered forms and checks including repair orders and parts counter tickets and manual journals and ledger books to assist in bookkeeping and accounting functions  use of hand held  battery operated finance computers in order to continue providing finance services to our customers  establishing emergency reserves of supplies in the event that service from third party lenders and suppliers is disrupted due to yk problems within their systems  and training of employees to manually perform functions that are currently performed on computers 
while we believe that we are taking appropriate steps to ensure we are adequately prepared to deal with year problems as they arise  we cannot make assurances that year problems will not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in a worst case scenario  year problems may delay our ability to sell vehicles  provide financing and insurance to our customers  provide parts and repair service to our customers  complete acquisitions or meet third party obligations until year problems can be resolved in the affected systems 
significant materiality of goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets acquired 
the cumulative amount of goodwill at december  was million and at december  was million 
as a percentage of total assets and stockholders equity  goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  represented and  respectively  at december   and and  respectively  at december  generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill and all other intangible assets be amortized over the period benefited 
we have determined that the period benefited by the goodwill will be no less than years 
accordingly  we are amortizing goodwill over a year period 
earnings reported in periods immediately following an acquisition would be overstated if sonic attributed a year benefit to an intangible asset that should have had a shorter benefit period 
in later years  sonic would be burdened by a continuing charge against earnings without the associated benefit to income valued by management in arriving at the price paid for the businesses acquired 
earnings in later years also could be significantly affected if management then determined that the remaining balance of goodwill was impaired 
we periodically compare the carrying value of goodwill with the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations of the businesses we have acquired in order to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill 
we have concluded that the anticipated future cash flows associated with intangible assets recognized in our acquisitions will continue indefinitely  and these is no pervasive evidence that any material portion will dissipate over a period shorter than years 
we will incur additional goodwill in future acquisitions 
effects of inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation in  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on sonic s results of operations for those periods 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this standard redefines how operating segments are determined and requires disclosure of certain financial and descriptive information about a company s operating segments 
this statement became effective for sonic s fiscal year ending december  the implementation of fas did not have a significant impact on sonic s financial statements or related disclosures 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities 
this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the statement will become effective for sonic beginning january  we have elected earlier application of all of the provisions of this statement beginning october  the implementation of the provisions of this statement did not have an impact on sonic s financial statements for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
sonic s only financial instruments with market risk exposure are variable rate floor plan notes payable  revolving facility borrowings and other variable rate notes and mortgages 
as of december   the total outstanding balance of such instruments was approximately million 
a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense for the year ended december  of approximately million 
in addition  a decrease or increase in interest rates would cause a respective increase or decrease in the present value of sonic s fixed rate senior subordinated notes  which have a carrying value of million at december
