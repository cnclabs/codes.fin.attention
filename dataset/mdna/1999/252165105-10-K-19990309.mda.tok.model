for information on environmental matters  see events  trends and vulnerabilities footnote on pages and  and the environmental liabilities footnote on page of the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference 
pursuant to authority granted under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  the us environmental protection agency usepa has issued a national priority list of sites at which action is to be taken to mitigate the risk of release of hazardous substances into the environment 
the company is engaged in continuing negotiations with the usepa and state authorities with regard to of the over twelve hundred sites on the national priority list 
due to the uncertainty of the remedial measures to be adopted at various sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability is possible under cercla  the liability of the company with respect to any site at which remedial measures have not been completed cannot be established with certainty 
nevertheless  based upon the information available at this time  the company believes it has properly provided for its best estimate of the liabilities and that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in the future 
impact of the year general the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems  equipment  or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to properly manufacture products  process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on its initial assessments  the company determined that it would be required to modify or replace portions of its equipment  hardware  and software so that affected systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that  with modifications and replacement of existing equipment  hardware  and software  the year issue will be mitigated 
project plan the company s plan to resolve the year issue is being implemented by each of the company s businesses and involves five phases inventory  risk assessment  prioritization  and ownership assignment  compliance research  remediation  and testing 
the inventory phase and the risk assessment  prioritization and ownership assignment phase  which were performed concurrently  are substantially complete 
the compliance research phase is expected to be substantially completed by march  the remediation and testing phases are expected to be substantially completed by september  although the company s year plan is being completed on a business by business basis  it is estimated that the compliance research phase is complete  the remediation phase is approximately to complete  and the testing phase is approximately to complete 
the company s year inventory of potentially affected items is segregated into four categories business applications developed software  customized extensions to purchased software and system interfaces  tools and platforms purchased commercial products  both hardware and software  intelligent devices manufacturing  laboratory  office  and facilities equipment  and external business partners suppliers  customers  and other service providers 
business applications and tools and platforms are considered information technology it systems while intelligent devices and external business partners are considered non it systems 
concerning it systems  two of the company s businesses will replace most of their existing applications with a year compliant version of new enterprise resource planning erp software 
those legacy systems for these businesses that will not be replaced by the erp system will either be made year compliant or replaced 
two businesses are in the process of repairing ie  making year compliant their existing core business systems and will replace some portions of their software with year compliant software 
the remaining businesses have upgraded their core business applications to a year compliant software version and are in the process of testing these applications for year compliancy 
with respect to non it systems  the company has dedicated resources to assist its businesses with identifying potentially affected intelligent devices and is using an outside firm that has a proprietary year compliance status database to assist in the compliance research for these devices 
determination of compliance status  remediation  and testing of these devices may be more difficult than it systems  as some of the manufacturers of potentially affected equipment may no longer be in business 
the external business partners category primarily includes the process of identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers and customers and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
the company has established a questionnaire to be used by the businesses for obtaining this information from key business partners 
to date  the company is not aware of any problems that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of insuring that these parties will be year ready and the inability of these parties to successfully complete their year compliance program could impact the company 
for key business partners  the initial assessments are evaluated and  as deemed necessary  follow up assessments are made 
we expect this process to be ongoing throughout the company is in the process of developing detailed contingency and business continuation plans for each business to address potential year exposures 
costs the company utilizes both internal and external resources to repair or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at between and million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million approximately expensed and capitalized related to all phases of the year project 
the remaining project costs are attributable to either repair or replacement of equipment  hardware  and software and will be expensed as incurred or capitalized  as appropriate 
risks the failure to remediate a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations  including the ability to produce or deliver products to customers 
such failures could materially or adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  the company is unable to determine with certainty at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company 
the company s year plan is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that by executing its year plan in a timely manner  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the company plans to complete the year project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including  but not limited to  the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
estimates of the status of completion and the expected completion dates are based on tasks completed to date compared to all required tasks 
however  there can be no guarantee that expected completion dates will be met  and actual results could differ materially from those forecasted 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in certain areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant equipment  devices and computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dexter is exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices  and selectively uses financial instruments to manage these risks 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the long term debt footnote on pages and  and the currency exchange effects footnote on page of the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference 
the company has two interest rate exchange agreements with a financial institution to limit exposure to interest rate volatility 
additionally  the company enters into forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the risks of doing business in foreign currencies 
the company hedges currency exposures of firm commitments and specific assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies to protect against the possibility of diminished cash flow and adverse impact on earnings 
the company s currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the german mark  swiss franc  british pound sterling  swedish krona and japanese yen 
selective translation exposures are hedged using foreign currency denominated debt 
the company s exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials 
the company manages its exposure to changes in those prices primarily through its procurement and sales practices 
at december   the company had no financial instruments outstanding as hedges of commodity price risk 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by dexter as an integral part of dexter s overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on dexter s results 
the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments is subject to change as a result of movement in market rates and prices 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate the impact of such possible movements on the valuation of these instruments 
based on a hypothetical ten percent change in the value of business unit functional currencies at december   the company estimates that the fair market value of the forward foreign currency contracts would have changed by million 
further  the impact on dexter s future cash flow related to foreign currency denominated debt would be million 
in addition  based on a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december   the company estimates that the fair market value of the interest rate exchange agreements would have decreased by million 
changes in the fair market value of the forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate exchange agreements are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged positions 
further  based on a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december   the company estimates that the fair market value of its fixed rate long term debt would have increased by million  which includes the effect of interest rate exchange agreements 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates related to floating rate debt at december  would decrease future pretax earnings and cash flow by million annually
