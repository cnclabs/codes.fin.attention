management believes that existing cash and investments  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating requirements through at least fiscal factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those detailed below  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the actual results that the company achieves may differ materially from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
intense competition 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new product versions and enhanced services 
a number of companies currently offer products and services that compete directly or indirectly with one or more of the company s products 
these companies include adobe systems inc adobe  apple computer  inc  asymetrix corporation  corel corporation corel  microsoft corporation microsoft and real networks  inc as the company competes with larger competitors such as adobe and microsoft across a broader range of product lines and different platforms  the company may face increasing competition from such companies 
in addition  the company s consumer business competes and partners with a number of other internet community  gaming and entertainment sites 
many of these businesses are much larger than the company s consumer business  and they have more resources devoted to these business efforts 
it is anticipated that the company s consumer business will face competition from these other sites both for consumers and for advertising and other future revenue sources on which the future success of the consumer business is dependent 
rapidly changing technology 
the developing digital media  internet and online services markets  and the personal computer industry are characterized by rapidly changing technology  resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company must continuously update its existing products  services and content to keep them current with changing technology and consumer tastes and must develop new products  services and content to take advantage of new technologies and consumer preferences that could render the company s existing products obsolete 
the company s future prospects are highly dependent on its ability to increase functionality of existing products in a timely manner and to develop new products that address new technologies and achieve market acceptance 
new products and enhancements must keep pace with competitive offerings  adapt to new platforms and emerging industry standards  and provide additional functionality 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
fluctuations of operating results  product introduction delays 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from its web publishing products 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products  and such delays may occur in the future 
if the company was unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce such products in a timely manner  this inability could have a material adverse page effect on the company s results of operations 
if the company does not ship new versions of its products as planned  sales of existing versions decline  or new products do not receive market acceptance  the company s results of operations in a given quarter could be materially adversely affected as they were during the fourth quarter of fiscal when the company delayed shipment of a new version of director to the following quarter 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may vary significantly depending on the impact of any of the following the timing of product introductions by competitors  changes in pricing  execution and volume of technology licensing agreements  the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast  and finally  any acquisitions of other companies or technologies 
the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  including the company s ability to continue to develop or acquire innovative products  its product and customer mix  and the level of competition 
the company s results of operations may also be affected by seasonal trends 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s forecasts  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase  or that new products introduced by the company  whether developed internally or acquired  will achieve market acceptance 
the company s historical rates of growth should not be taken as indicative of growth rates that can be expected in the future 
unproven business model 
the company s consumer business model depends upon its ability to leverage its existing and future web traffic and consumer audience to grow revenues and in the future generate multiple revenue streams 
the potential profitability of this business model is unproven  and to be successful  the company must  among other things  develop and market content that achieves broad market acceptance by its user community  internet advertisers and commerce vendors 
there can be no assurance that the consumer business will be able to effectively implement this business model  and even if the implementation is successful  there can be no assurance that the business model will prove to be able to sustain revenue growth or generate significant profits  if any 
furthermore  for the foreseeable future  the company anticipates that the consumer business will require significant expenditures  particularly related to sales and marketing and brand promotion  and that such expenditures may or may not result in revenue growth 
given the company s limited operating experience related to the consumer business  the prediction of future revenue growth or operating performance for the consumer business is difficult at best 
the company expects the consumer business to generate net losses for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the foregoing the consumer business will depend in part on success in building strategic alliances with other internet companies and media companies in order to be able to grow the user base and to provide compelling content to attract and maintain the user base 
there can be no assurances that such alliances can be created or maintained over an extended period of time 
dependence on distributors 
a substantial majority of the company s revenues is derived from the sale of its products through a variety of distribution channels  including traditional software distributors  mail order  educational distributors  vars  original equipment manufacturers oems  hardware and software superstores  retail dealers  and direct sales 
domestically  the company s products are sold primarily through distributors  vars  and oems 
in particular  one distributor  ingram micro  inc  accounted for  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the next three distributors combined  two of which are international distributors  accounted for of revenues in fiscal internationally  the company s products are sold through distributors 
the company s resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including in some cases  products that are competitive with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide them with adequate levels of support 
in addition  the company believes that certain distributors are reducing their inventory in the channel and returning unsold products to better manage their inventories 
distributors are increasingly seeking to return unsold product  particularly when a new version or upgrade of a product has superseded such products 
if the company s distributors were to seek to return increasing amounts of products  such returns could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
the loss of  or a significant page reduction in sales volume to  a significant reseller could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on technology platforms 
in the past  a majority of the company s revenues was derived from its products for the macintosh computing platform 
macintosh revenues accounted for of product revenues for fiscal  compared to of revenues for fiscal although the relative percentage of macintosh platform revenues will vary from quarter to quarter based on product release schedules  the company remains heavily dependent on the sale of products for the macintosh platform 
the success of the company s product and consumer businesses is dependent upon the existence and future growth of the internet as a business  entertainment and communications platform 
a change in the internet or the technology used for operation of the internet or a decline in the growth of the internet could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
risks of international operations 
for fiscal  the company derived approximately of its revenues from international sales 
the company expects that international sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of its revenues 
the company relies on distributors for sales of its products in foreign countries and  accordingly  is dependent on their ability to promote and support the company s products  and in some cases  to translate them into foreign languages 
international business is subject to a number of special risks  including foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  more prevalent software piracy  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  foreign currency risk  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
in addition  the company s results may be adversely affected by worldwide economic events beyond the control of the company  such as the prolonged economic downturn occurring in japan 
there can be no assurances that japan s economy will recover in the near term or that the company s results or growth rates in this geographic region will return to previous levels even if the recovery occurs 
the company s revenue from japan declined from of total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal  and to just of total revenue in fiscal the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce economic exposure associated with sales and asset balances denominated in various european currencies and japanese yen 
as of march   notional principal of forward contracts outstanding amounted to million 
there can be no assurance that such contracts will adequately hedge the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
euro dollar 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as the common legal currency and established fixed rates of conversion between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro will trade on currency exchanges and be available for non cash transactions 
a three year transition period is expected during which transactions can be made in the old currencies 
the conversion to the euro will eliminate currency exchange risk between the member counties 
the company does not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion as its financial information system can accommodate multiple currencies 
in addition  the company has confirmed with its international financial institutions that they have the ability to process transactions in either euros or sovereign currency 
however  there can be no assurance that all issues related to the euro conversion have been identified  and the company may be at risk if any of its principal suppliers are unable to deal with the impact of the euro conversion 
to date  none of the company s international suppliers have expressed an intention to invoice in euros 
page risks associated with acquisitions 
macromedia has grown in part because of combinations with other companies 
in october  the company acquired solis design  inc  a developer of computer managed instruction software for enterprise wide  web based learning solutions 
the acquisition was structured as a tax free merger and was accounted for under the purchase method 
the appraisal of the acquired research and development was based upon the present value of the operating cash flows generated by the current technology after taking into account the cost to realize the revenue  the relative risk of the products and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value of invested capital 
as a result of the acquisition  the company wrote off million of purchased in process research and development and other costs related to the transaction 
the purchased in process research and development expense related to completion of solis corporate training software 
at the time of the acquisition  solis had a preliminary technology 
there were significant uncertainties as to the viability of the technology to provide a complete corporate solution and improvement of the stability of the technology 
the company also concluded that the acquired technology had no alternative future use 
in january  the company released a first java implementation of the technology  with a more complete internet solution shipping in march additionally  there are integration risks associated with merging two companies including financial  administrative and cultural concerns 
volatility of stock 
the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to the company  changes in analysts earnings estimates for the company or its industry and factors affecting the corporate environment or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
generally accepted accounting principles 
the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec  and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on the company s reported results  and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed prior to the announcement of a change 
year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code and embedded technology in existing systems as the year approaches 
the year issue arises from the potential for computers to fail or operate incorrectly because their programs incorrectly interpret the two digit date fields as or some other year  rather than the year the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties  including customers  vendors and manufacturers  with whom the company deals worldwide 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition  though the company is unable to assess that potential impact at this time 
to mitigate this risk  the company has established a formal year program to oversee and coordinate the assessment  remediation  testing and reporting activities related to this issue 
the company believes that provided it is able to complete the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
page as previously reported  the company completed the assessment phase of its year program 
as part of this assessment  the company s application systems eg  financial systems  various custom developed business applications  technology infrastructure eg  networks  servers  desktop equipment  facilities eg  security systems  fire alarm systems  vendors  partners and products were reviewed to determine their state of year compliance 
this review included the collection of documentation from software and hardware manufacturers  the detailed review of programming code for custom applications  the physical testing of desktop equipment using software designed to test for year compliance  the examination of key vendors partners year programs and the ongoing testing of the company s products as part of normal quality assurance activities 
this assessment revealed no significant issues with the company s application systems  technology infrastructure  facilities or products 
with the completion of the company s assessment phase  and with very little remedial action necessary  the company embarked into its testing phase 
at this time  all important systems both computer systems and systems dependent on embedded technology have been individually tested and validated for year compliance  with no significant issues identified 
the company is targeting june  for the completion of all other testing 
all current versions of the company s products have been tested for year compliance 
in general  the products are believed to be compliant  assuming that the operating systems upon which they run have been updated to comply 
both microsoft and apple have stated that their operating systems will continue to operate properly into the twenty first century 
details about older  non shipping versions of the company s products can be found on the company s web site 
a year issue was identified with shockwave v the corrective action for this issue is for customers to upgrade to version or later  or to downgrade to version the company currently offers shockwave at no cost as a downloadable run time technology on their web site 
both of these upgrades are available at no charge from the company s web site 
the company also sells distribution rights to shockwave which include maintenance 
these customers will receive the upgrade in accordance with their maintenance agreements 
the company intends to assess the proper response to any future noted product issues as and when any such issues arise 
several of the company s distribution  manufacturing and support partners themselves have significant year programs underway  some of which involve the upgrade and or replacement of systems which are important to the day to day operations of the partners business 
for each of these partners  the company has established contingency plans that contemplate the failure of the partners to complete their year programs 
it should also be noted that the company cannot complete its final testing until the partners year programs have been completed  due to the electronic communication that takes place between the company s and the partners systems 
the company believes that the costs associated with completing its year program will be approximately million 
the company reached this assessment with the assistance of outside consultants to whom the company paid million 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or additional material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in its own products  the technology used in its internal systems  or by failures of its vendors partners to address their year issues in a timely and effective manner 
as of the end of fiscal year  approximately of the total estimated year program costs have been incurred 
of the expenditures remaining for the program  it is estimated that of this represents costs associated with human resources performing testing  and represents miscellaneous hardware and software upgrades required for the completion of the year program 
the funding for the year program is being provided as a normal operating expense except in the case of any new capital hardware  which is being funded from standard capital budgets 
page while the company s programs are intended to minimize the possibility of such effects  should miscalculations or other operational errors occur as a result of the year issue  the company or the parties on which it depends may be unable to produce reliable information or to process routine transactions 
furthermore  in the worst case  the company or the parties on which it depends may  for an extended period of time  be incapable of conducting critical business activities which include  but are not limited to  providing services  manufacturing and shipping products  invoicing customers and paying vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers 
as stated in its policy  the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
the table below represents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s investment portfolio 
all investments mature  by policy  in three years or less 
in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents   average interest rate short term investments     average interest rate total investment securities     the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in japan and certain european countries 
the company has established a foreign currency hedging program using foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  and probable anticipated  but not firmly committed  transactions 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on the company s foreign currency exposures that principally arise from the transactions denominated in japanese yen and various european currencies 
under this program  increases or decreases in the company s foreign currency denominated financial assets are partially offset by gains or losses of the hedging instruments 
the forward contracts are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
the company does not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the table below provides information about the company s outstanding forward contracts as of march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents  as presented in the company s financial statements 
the table presents the fair value at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates

exposures to the company include changes in short term us prime interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
also  because the foreign currency risk table above does not present the foreign currency denominated financial assets and probable anticipated transactions underlying the forward contracts  the information presented has limited predictive value 
the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at the time  and foreign currency rates 
the company also has loans outstanding from related parties totaling million as of march  the stated loan amounts approximate fair value as of march page
