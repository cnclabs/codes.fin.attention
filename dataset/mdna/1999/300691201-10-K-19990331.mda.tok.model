software revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased volume of objectstore software licenses and the continued market acceptance of our products 
services revenues 
services revenues increased  to million in from million in the higher services revenue included increased consulting revenues relating to customer deployments and higher billable utilization of consulting personnel in  as well as increased maintenance revenues  reflecting growth in our installed base 
growing demand for our consulting services has led us to increase the number of our consulting personnel 
as a result  we expect that our services revenues will grow in absolute dollars in future periods  but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 
related party software and services revenues 
revenues from related parties decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the fact that a large software purchase by ibm in the first quarter of that was not repeated in  and to the discontinuation in of a joint development project with ibm 
we expect related party software and services revenues to continue to decrease in significance in future periods 
revenues from international operations 
revenues from the operations of our international subsidiaries increased million in as compared to and also increased as a percentage of our total revenues  to in compared with in the increase is due to increased volume of objectstore software licenses and is attributable to the expansion of our international direct sales force and increased services revenue reflecting growth in our international installed base 
cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues increased  to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of software revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of software revenues reflect lower royalty costs in  due in part to a change in revenue mix toward sales of objectstore and other products that bear lower or no third party royalties 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased  to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of services revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount reflects the growth in staffing necessary to generate and support increased worldwide service revenues and provide customer support to our growing installed base 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to higher average utilization of consulting personnel in we expect cost of services revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars in future periods 
cost of related party software and services revenues 
the cost of related party software and services revenues declined  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of related party software and services revenues to from in such years  respectively 
the increased cost as a percentage of revenues was attributable to a shift in the mix of revenues in from higher margin software revenues to lower margin maintenance revenues 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense increased  to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount resulted primarily from continued efforts to expand and retain our sales force and increased marketing investment  including increased expenditures on salaries  recruiting fees  marketing programs  travel and other related expenses  as well as higher sales commissions associated with higher revenues 
we intend to continue our efforts to expand and retain our sales force and maintain higher levels of marketing investments throughout the next year and  as a result  expect selling and marketing expense to continue to increase in future years 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from for the expense increase was due principally to the addition of personnel  depreciation of capital equipment and related overhead for enhancements to existing products and the development of new products 
we expect research and development expense to increase in future years to enhance the objectstore enterprise database and to develop new products 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in compared to in the increase in dollar amount is reflective of the increased staffing  investments in information technology  professional expenses and other costs associated with our expanding operations 
other income 
other income decreased  to million in from million in the decrease was largely the result of lower rates of return on cash and investments 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate of and for and  respectively  reflects an alternative minimum tax provision for federal taxes and certain foreign and state taxes 
the effective tax rate in both years is lower than the statutory rate principally due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
compared to software revenues 
software revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased volume of objectstore software licenses 
we continued to expand our customer base as a result of our additional focus on selling to customers that are developing and deploying component based computing applications

related party software and services revenues 
revenues from related parties decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a drop in ibm revenue which resulted from the discontinuation of a joint development project in  which was partially offset by a single large purchase of software licenses by ibm in the first quarter of revenues from international operations

cost of related party software and services revenues 
the cost of related party software and services revenues declined  to  in from  in  and declined as a percentage of related party software and services revenues to from in such years  respectively

the effective tax rate in both years is lower than the statutory rate principally due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity included million of cash and marketable securities  an increase of million from  and a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit expires in may and we expect to renew the line of credit at terms similar to the existing agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit during the twelve months ended december   but letters of credit in the amount of  under the line of credit were outstanding at that date 
net cash provided by our operating activities was million in  as compared to  used for operating activities in the increase in cash provided was primarily the result of increased net income  improvement in accounts receivable collections  increased deferred revenue associated with prepaid maintenance fees and increased accrued expenses from expanding operations 
our investing activities used million of cash in compared with cash provided by our investing activities of million in the increased use of cash was attributable primarily to the net purchase of million of marketable securities in  compared to the net sale of million of marketable securities in  and million of capitalized software in our financing activities provided cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to the repayment of advances to shareholders and higher proceeds from our employee stock plans  offset by the  purchase of treasury shares in we believe that current cash  marketable securities  and funds generated from operations  if any  will provide adequate liquidity to meet our capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
year compliance concerns have been widely expressed regarding the inability of certain computer programs to properly process certain date information beyond the year these concerns focus on the impact of the year problem on business operations and the potential costs associated with identifying and addressing the problem 
state of readiness we have developed a year readiness plan focusing on i assessing the readiness of our product offerings  internal business systems  and major vendors and suppliers  ii addressing known risks  and iii planning and budgeting for reasonably likely contingencies 
we are in the process of reviewing our current product offerings for year compliance and believe that  with the exception of certain minor administrative functions that do not affect the utility of the product  our current products are year compliant in all material respects 
we are conducting only limited testing of products that are no longer offered  and thus the year compliance of such products is generally not known 
most of these untested products are previous releases of current offerings that can be upgraded to achieve year compliance 
testing of certain third party software programs that are incorporated in our product offerings is in process and is expected to be complete by july we are also in the process of reviewing and upgrading our internal information technology and business systems  both domestically and internationally  to ensure year readiness 
this process is expected to be complete by july with respect to the majority of our mission critical systems 
we expect to continue testing our internal systems and to undertake necessary corrective measures throughout finally  we have commenced a program to survey the year readiness of our major vendors and suppliers  with a particular focus on the year readiness of our mission critical vendors and suppliers 
this process is expected to be complete by the middle of where we believe that a particular vendor or supplier poses unacceptable year risks  we will identify an alternative supply source 
costs of year compliance costs incurred in the year compliance effort will be expensed as incurred 
to date  we have incurred less than  of costs  not including internal personnel time in the evaluation and remediation of the year issues 
while our year compliance evaluation is not yet complete  we do not at this time expect to incur more than  of costs  not including internal personnel time to remediate the year problem 
we cannot  of course  predict the nature or materiality of the impact on our operations or operating results of noncompliance by parties with whom we do not have a direct relationship 
in particular  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available for the purchase of our products and services 
risk of year issues and contingency plans our worst case year scenarios include i undetected errors or uncorrected defects in our current product offerings  ii corruption of data contained in our internal information systems  and iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by third parties and government agencies eg  electricity  phone service  internet services  etc 
either which could significantly disrupt our operations 
we are in the process of reviewing our contingency planning in all of these areas and expect the plans to include  among other things  the availability of support personnel to assist with customer support issues  manual work arounds for internal software failure  and substitution of systems  if needed 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro  making the euro their common legal currency on that date 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january  and january  the transition period 
during the transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
however  conversion rates no longer will be computed directly from one legacy currency to another 
instead  a triangular process will apply whereby an amount denominated in one legacy currency will first be converted into the euro 
the resultant euro denominated amount will then be converted into the second legacy currency 
we have evaluated the business implications of conversion to the euro  including technical adaptation of information technology and other systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions  long term competitive implications of the conversions and the effect on market risk with respect to financial instruments and do not expect a material impact on our operations 
new accounting standards on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this new standard 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar statements are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to our future shipments  revenue and expense levels and profitability  as well as the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements  may be forward looking statements 
our disclosures in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  also constitute forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance  but are based on assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made  and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements whether in response to new information  future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause our actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
our future success will depend to a substantial degree on the emergence and widespread adoption of object oriented programming as a methodology for developing and deploying multi user business applications 
there can be no assurance that object oriented programming will become  and remain  an accepted methodology for developing and deploying enterprise wide business applications or that our object oriented database products and services will achieve or maintain market acceptance 
in addition  the success of our new excelon product will depend on widespread adoption of the recently introduced xml data format by companies building large scale web applications 
there can be no assurance  however  that the xml format will emerge as an industry standard or even achieve common market acceptance as a basis for developing enterprise wide web applications 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and sales personnel 
while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in hiring qualified personnel to date  competition for such personnel in the high technology industry is intense 
we have experienced attrition and this cannot be predicted 
however  we continue to expend significant resources to train and retain sales personnel to reduce attrition 
we assume that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain sales personnel  however  could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
as we have refocused our sales and marketing efforts  the profile of our customers is shifting from large telecommunications and financial institutions to a broader group of small and large companies in many industry segments 
as a result  sales personnel now need to develop and manage an increasing number of smaller dollar value transactions 
the result could be less accurate sales forecasting 
our marketing department also needs to develop a stream of qualified leads at a more rapid pace than in the past in order to keep the sales force at high productivity 
we depend on product innovation and new product releases to remain competitive 
any delay in the release of products or failure of released products to meet the market expectation of functionality and features could undermine our competitive position 
furthermore  certain of our competitors are significantly larger and are expending greater amounts on research and development and sales and marketing than we are 
the result could be new competitive product introductions that could limit the salability of our products  put pressure on sales prices  or diminish our reputation as a leader in object oriented database technology 
we expect to expand our channel partner program primarily to market and distribute our excelon product 
our channel partners are not within our control and are not obligated to purchase our products and may also represent other lines of products that may conflict with our product offerings 
although we expect to expend significant resources developing and maintaining these channels  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop these channels or that any expansion of channels will increase revenues 
our announced scheduled release dates for products and product enhancements are forward looking statements 
the actual release dates for such products and enhancements could differ materially from those announced as a result of a variety of factors  including the ability of our engineers to solve technical problems and test products as well as factors outside our control 
we typically receive the majority of our revenue in any quarter in the last month of the quarter with a concentration of revenue in the latter half of such month 
this pattern  common to many software companies  makes it difficult to forecast accurately  increasing the possibility of missing a quarterly revenue or profit target 
any inability to obtain orders in large volume or to make shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenue targets 
any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales by our international subsidiaries and to distributors outside the united states 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for objectstore or our other products 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile 
in particular  the market price of our stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to certain market risks  primarily adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we have not invested in derivative instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe that the fair value of other financial instruments reflected in our consolidated balance sheets do not entail a market risk due to the nature of these instruments and their short term maturities 
we also do not believe that our future earnings  fair values and or cash flows are subject to risk of material near term loss due to changes in market rates or prices that we consider to be reasonably possible in the near term 
however  our exposure to market risk may change over time as our business practices evolve  and could in the future materially adversely effect our financial condition and results of operations 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and the asia pacific region 
financial risk management the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value at the balance sheet date due to the short maturities of these instruments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
information about our investment portfolio is set forth in note c of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders equity 
to date  we have not experienced material losses on our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk fluctuations in exchange rates can adversely effect our results of operations and financial position 
the financial statements of our international subsidiaries  all of whose functional currencies are the local currency  are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for results of operations 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  and also are included in reporting comprehensive income 
we also engage in transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses from these transactions  which to date have been immaterial  are reflected in the results of operations 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition cannot accurately be predicted 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities
