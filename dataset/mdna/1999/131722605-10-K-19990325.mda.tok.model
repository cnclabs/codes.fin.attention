item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview calypte s efforts are primarily focused on selling  developing and obtaining approval for calypte s urine based and serum based diagnostic tests for sexually transmitted diseases 
in august  the company received a product license and an establishment license from the us food and drug administration fda to manufacture and sell calypte s urine based hiv screening test for use in professional laboratory settings 
in june   the company announced that the fda had licensed the urine hiv western blot supplemental test that confirms the presence of antibodies to hiv in urine samples 
the new test is used on samples that are repeatedly reactive in our hiv urine antibody screening test 
the new test completes the only available fda approved urine based hiv test method 
there can be no assurance the company will have significant revenues from sales of the hiv urine screening assay or the supplemental test 
in december  calypte acquired from cambridge biotech certain assets relating to the western blot product line for certain infectious diseases 
the acquisition included the urine based and serum based hiv western blot products  as well as a supplemental test for lyme disease and human t lymphotropic virus htlv 
the company expects operating losses to continue as the company continues its marketing and sales activities for its first fda approved products and conduct additional research and development for subsequent products 
the company s marketing strategy is to use distributors  focused direct selling and marketing partners to penetrate certain targeted domestic markets 
the company plans to maintain a small direct sales force to sell the company s urine based hiv test to laboratories serving the life insurance market 
international and other us markets will be addressed utilizing diagnostic product distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successfully commercialized or that the company will achieve significant product revenues 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and product sales for calypte increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in product sales was primarily due to higher sales volume of our hiv screening test in anticipation of and after fda approval of the urine hiv western blot test 
product costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product costs for the year ended december  were higher because a greater quantity of product produced was expensed since it was not retained as saleable inventory 
during the year ended december   a greater quantity of product was valued as inventory raw materials  work in process and finished goods after fda approval of the supplemental test for calypte s hiv urine screening test 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increase was principally due to clinical investigations performed for the discordant study a study of hiv antibodies found in urine when the same person tests negative for hiv antibodies in blood  higher minimum product license fees  research funding made to outside organizations and more personnel hired to complete research and development studies 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the increase in the use of consultants related to various projects and increased expenses related to the launch and marketing of our hiv urine screening test and western blot supplemental test 
interest income  interest expense and other income increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the interest earned from proceeds of a private placement of common stock in october  the decrease in interest paid for capital leases and interest earned on loans made to officers and employees and pepgen corporation 
years ended december  and product sales from calypte s hiv screening test increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  product costs increased million to million in from million in product sold in and relate to sales made primarily to laboratories for research and evaluation purposes 
sales in increased due to the company receiving more orders from these customers 
since fda approval of calypte s hiv urine screening test in august  manufacturing costs related to the test have been included in product costs  rather than research and development expense 
the increase in product costs in reflects the inclusion of a full year of these costs compared to only a partial year in research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally due to the october reduction in workforce  the conscious effort to reduce costs and the recognition of certain product costs and inventory as separate financial statement items following fda approval of the company s hiv screening test in august selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the october reduction in workforce and the conscious effort to reduce costs 
in addition  included relocation costs which were not incurred in interest income expense and other income increased  to  for from  in the increase was primarily due to the company having interest expense on notes payable outstanding in  which were repaid in late  and interest earned from initial public offering and private placement proceeds in liquidity and capital resources financing activities the company has financed operations from inception primarily through the private placement of preferred stock and common stock  the company s initial public offering ipo of common stock and  to a lesser extent  from payments related to research and development agreements  a bank line of credit  equipment lease financings and borrowings from notes payable 
during  the company completed its ipo of  shares of its common stock at per share 
after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions and additional expenses associated with the ipo  the company received net proceeds of million 
part of the proceeds was used to pay down a million bank line of credit  a  note payable to a former related party and the pepgen note payable of million 
the pepgen note payable was paid in october in october  the company entered into an equipment lease line of credit for million expiring on december  lease payments under the line of credit are based on the total delivered equipment cost multiplied by a monthly note factor of approximately approximate effective interest rate of 
in december  there was a drawdown of  on this equipment lease line of credit 
the equipment lease line of credit expired at the end of in april  the company entered into a line of credit agreement with a bank to borrow up to million at an interest rate of prime plus 
the agreement required the company to maintain certain financial covenants and comply with certain reporting and other requirements 
in addition  borrowings under the line of credit agreement were secured by the company s assets 
in june  the company drew down  on the line of credit 
subsequently  in july  the company drew down an additional  on the line of credit  thereby increasing the note payable to million 
the million was repaid in september and the line of credit was terminated 
in october  the company completed a private placement of  shares of its common stock at per share 
the company received proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agent commissions and additional expenses associated with the private placement 
in january  the company completed a private placement of  shares of common stock to institutional investors in a private placement at per share 
calypte received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agent commissions and additional expenses associated with the private placement 
in january  the company entered into a line of credit agreement with a bank to borrow up to million at an interest rate of prime plus 
the agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants and comply with certain reporting and other requirements 
in addition  borrowings under the line of credit agreement are secured by calypte s assets 
in january  calypte drew down million on the line of credit 
although the company believes current cash will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements for the next six months  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of its products  regulatory actions by the fda and other international regulatory bodies  intellectual property protection  and the ability to raise additional capital in a timely manner 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successfully commercialized or that the company will achieve significant product revenues 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to raise additional capital or that such capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any failure to raise additional financing will likely place us in significant financial jeopardy 
therefore  the company cannot predict the adequacy of its capital resources on a long term basis 
operating activities for the years ended december  and  the company s cash used in operations was million and million  respectively 
the cash used in operations was primarily to fund research and development as well as manufacturing expenses related to the urine based hiv test along with selling  general and administrative expenses of the company 
in october  the company implemented an expense reduction program  including a significant reduction in its workforce 
employee termination costs associated with the expense reduction program were not material 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risk factors  along with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus  in deciding whether to invest in our shares 
these factors  among others  may cause actual results  events or performance to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made in this form k 
uncertain market acceptance of our new method of determining the presence of hiv antibodies 
our products incorporate a new method of determining the presence of hiv antibodies 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain any significant degree of market acceptance among physicians  patients or health care payors  or recommendations and endorsements by the medical community which are essential for market acceptance of the products 
we have fda approval to market our urine hiv screening and supplemental tests in the united states and in july  we began marketing this product 
however  to date this product has only generated limited revenues and not achieved significant market penetration 
the failure of our products to obtain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have little experience in selling and marketing our hiv urine based screening test 
we have little experience marketing and selling our products either directly or through our distributors  since we only began such sales in the second half of the success of our products depends upon alliances with third party distributors 
there can no assurance that our direct selling efforts will be effective  our distributors will market successfully our products  or if our relationships with distributors terminate  we will be able to establish relationships with other distributors on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any disruption in our distribution  sales or marketing network could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have sustained losses in the past and we expect to sustain losses in the future 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million and our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
we expect operating losses to continue as we continue our marketing and sales activities for our fda approved products and conduct additional research and development for subsequent products 
our quarterly results may fluctuate due to certain regulatory  marketing and competitive factors over which we have little or no control 
the factors listed below  some of which we cannot control  may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate significantly actions taken by the fda or foreign regulatory bodies relating to our products  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the timing and size of distributor purchases  and introductions by competitors of alternative means for testing for hiv 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing that we will need in the next six months 
we believe that we will need to raise more money in the next six months to continue to finance our operations 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to raise additional financing will likely place us in significant financial jeopardy 
we depend upon the viability of three products our hiv urine based screening test and our urine and blood based supplemental tests 
our hiv urine base screening test and urine and blood based supplemental tests are our only products 
accordingly  we may have to cease operations if our tests fail to achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenues 
our products depend upon rights to technology that we have licensed from third party patent holders and there can be no assurance that the rights we have under these licensing agreements are sufficient or that we can adequately protect those rights 
we currently have the right to use patent and proprietary rights which are material to the manufacture and sale of our hiv urine based screening test under licensing agreements with new york university  cambridge biotech corporation  repligen  and the texas a m university system 
we rely on sole source suppliers that we cannot quickly replace for certain components critical to the manufacture of our products 
any delay or interruption in the supply of these components could have a material adverse effect on us by significantly impairing our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities  particularly as we increase our manufacturing activities in support of commercial sales 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and little experience in manufacturing our products in commercial quantities 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  raw material supply  and shortages of qualified personnel 
the success of our plans to enter international markets may be limited or disrupted due to risks related to international trade and marketing and the capabilities of our distributors 
we anticipate that international distributor sales will generate a portion of our revenues for the next several years 
we believe that our urine based test can provide significant benefits in countries that do not have the facilities or personnel to safely and effectively collect and test blood samples 
the following risks may limit or disrupt our international sales  the imposition of government controls  export license requirements political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in managing international operations  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates 
some of our distributors have limited international marketing experience 
there can be no assurance that these distributors will be able to market successfully our products in foreign markets 
we face intense competition in the medical diagnostic products market and rapid technological advances by competitors 
competition in our diagnostic market is intense and we expect it to increase 
within the united states  our competitors include a number of well established manufacturers of hiv tests using blood samples  plus at least one system for the detection of hiv antibodies using oral fluid samples 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than ours 
these developments could render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products depends upon obtaining and maintaining fda and foreign regulatory approvals 
numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries regulate our products 
the fda regulates our products under federal statutes and regulations related to pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution  sale and promotion of medical devices in the united states 
if we fail to comply with fda regulations  or the fda believes that we are not in compliance with such regulations  the fda can detain or seize our products  issue a recall of our products  prohibit marketing and sales of our products  and assess civil and criminal penalties against us  our officers or our employees 
we also plan to sell our products in certain foreign countries where they may be subject to similar local regulatory requirements 
the imposition of any of the sanctions described above could have a material adverse effect on us 
the regulatory approval process in the united states and other countries is expensive  lengthy and uncertain 
we may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances in a timely manner  if at all 
we may lose previously obtained approvals or clearances or fail to comply with regulatory requirements 
the occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on calypte 
before we begin to manufacture our product at the alameda facility  we must obtain fda approval for that facility 
delays in receiving the fda s approval or other difficulties which we encounter in scaling up our manufacturing capacity to meet demand could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have received a warning letter from the fda regarding the sufficiency of our manufacturing records and production procedures and we must satisfy the fda s concerns in order to avoid regulatory action against us 
see manufacturing section with respect to this warning letter 
as a small manufacturer of medical diagnostic products  we are exposed to product liability and recall risks for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
we manufacture medical diagnostic products which subject us to risks of product liability claims or product recalls  particularly in the event of false positive or false negative reports 
a product recall or a successful product liability claim or claims which exceed our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us 
we maintain a  claims made policy of product liability insurance 
however  product liability insurance is expensive 
in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  our insurance coverage may not adequately protect us from liability which we incur in connection with clinical trials or sales of our products 
our charter documents may inhibit a takeover 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of calypte  diminish stockholders opportunities to participate in tender offers for our common stock  including tender offers at prices above the then current market price  or inhibit increases in the market price of our common stock that could results from takeover attempts 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that have certain anti takeover effects 
on december   the board of directors of calypte declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right right for each outstanding share of common stock of the company 
the dividend is payable to the stockholders of record on january  with respect to share of common stock issued thereafter until a subsequent distribution date defined in a rights agreement and  in certain circumstances  with respect to shares of common stock issued after the distribution date 
the description and terms of the rights are set forth in a rights agreement between the company and chasemellon shareholder services  llc  as rights agent  dated as of december  the rights have certain anti takeover effects 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company without conditioning the offer on the rights being redeemed or a substantial number of rights being acquired 
however  the rights should not interfere with any tender offer  or merger  which is approved by the company because the rights do not become exercisable in the event of a permitted offer or other acquisition exempted by the board 
an investor s ability to trade our common stock may be limited by trading volume 
the trading volume in our common shares has been relatively limited 
a consistently active trading market for our common stock may not develop 
we may be removed from the nasdaq smallcap market if we fail to meet certain maintenance criteria 
the nasdaq stock market inquired on one occasion whether we continue to meet the net capital surplus maintenance criterion for trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we currently meet the capital surplus requirement but our ability to continue to do so will depend on whether we are able to maintain a net capital surplus of at least  the public trading volume of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares could be significantly impaired if we fail to meet the maintenance criteria and are removed from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in that case  our common stock would trade on either the otc bulletin board  a regional exchange or in the pink sheets  which would likely results in an even more limited trading volume 
the price of calypte s common stock has been highly volatile due to several factors which will continue to effect the price of our stock 
our common stock has traded as low as and as high as between mid october and the end of february some of the factors leading to the volatility include price and volume fluctuations in the stock market at large which do not relate to our operating performance  fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make  fda and international regulatory actions  availability of reimbursement for use of our products from private health insurers  governmental health administration authorities and other third party payors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products that we or others develop  changes in health care policy in the united states or abroad  and changes in stock market analysts recommendations regarding calypte  other medical products companies or the medical product industry generally 
calypte and the price of calypte shares may be adversely effected by the public sale of a significant number of the shares eligible for future sale 
nearly all outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable 
sales of common stock in the public market could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
such sales also may inhibit our ability to obtain future equity or equity related financing on acceptable terms 
our research and development of hiv urine test involves the controlled use of hazardous materials 
there can be no assurance that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials such as azide will comply with applicable regulations 
in addition  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
we may be held liable for damages from such an accident and that liability could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to retain our key executives and research and development personnel 
as a small company with only employees  our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and research and development positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have not completed our year compliance program so the potential costs and complications associated with year compliance cannot be determined at this time 
calypte has a formal year program focusing on five key readiness areas hardware  addressing information technology  software  addressing business  research  financial  inventory planning  production control  product distribution and customer support  firmware  addressing built in microprocessors that control production and non production equipment  third party suppliers of critical inventory  and third party service providers 
calypte established a year task force earlier this year 
the task force is systematically examining each of the five key readiness areas by identifying items with year compliance concerns  assessing the risk and impact of noncompliance for each item identified  and correcting non compliant items and testing the corrections to ensure readiness at both component and system levels 
calypte is in the process of contacting key suppliers to identify any concerns which may arise due to such suppliers potential non compliance 
the task force will develop contingency plans if it discovers areas where there is a substantial possibility that year compliance will not be achieved 
calypte has identified items with year compliance concerns in three readiness areas software  third party suppliers of critical inventory and third party service providers 
we expect to complete risk assessment in each area for our california and maryland facilities by may  and the correction  testing and the development of contingency plans will follow 
until we have completed our risk assessment and developed any necessary contingency plans  we will not be in a position to identify our most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
we have presently completed correction and testing in the hardware readiness area for our california facilities and it is now year compliant in california 
as of december   we have spent a total of approximately  on our year program and have made limited expenditures related to our year program since then 
we estimate that total year costs to upgrade systems for our california and maryland facilities will range from  to  with the majority of costs to be incurred in the next six months 
at this time we do not anticipate that calypte will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer system improvements because our manufacturing process does not rely heavily on automation and our existing computer hardware has proven to be year compliant 
however  calypte is continuing to assess and develop alternatives that will require refinement of its cost estimate over time 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  our year compliance program 
therefore  the potential impact of possible complications on calypte s financial condition and results of operations cannot be determined at this time 
if computer systems used by calypte or its suppliers or the product integrity of products provided to calypte by suppliers fail or experience significant difficulties related to the year  calypte s operations and financial condition could be adversely effected
