 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that the changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
but does not believe that it will have a significant impact 
year compliance the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the use of computer programs which have been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year of business transactions 
the company has evaluated its principal staffing and financial systems  which are licensed from and maintained by third party software development companies  and believes that such systems are year compliant 
the company is currently in the process of selecting additional staffing and financial systems which management expects to be year compliant 
the company s total costs with respect to year compliance as of december  have not been material 
management does not anticipate that any remaining costs associated with assuring that its internal systems will be year compliant will be material to its business  operations or financial condition 
the company has initiated an assessment to determine the preparedness level of its significant clients  vendors  and other service providers with respect to year issues and the subsequent impact on the company 
if a significant client of the company encounters year problems  such client could be forced to reduce its expenditures on it projects involving the company s it professionals  either because the client would have to divert resources from such projects to address its year problem or because of the adverse financial effects of such problems on the client 
in addition  clients which incur significant costs in achieving year compliance could be forced or could elect to reallocate funds being used for projects involving the company s it professionals to address year compliance issues 
the company does not believe its current projects will be adversely affected by problems its clients may encounter resulting from lack of year compliance because most such projects will be completed before the year however  reallocation of it related expenditures by a client in connection with achieving year compliance could affect the duration of the company s existing projects with such client or the availability to the company of future it projects 
in addition  a small number of the company s it professionals perform year work for certain clients as an adjunct to other projects performed for such clients 
the company has a million professional liability insurance policy which covers  among other things  year compliance work performed by ubics at client sites 
some of the company s clients have requested the company to warrant that the services performed by the company s it professionals are year compliant 
the company is evaluating such requests from clients to determine whether and the extent to which it is appropriate for ubics to make such certifications 
the company s review of client and vendor readiness with respect to year is expected to be completed by the first half of and based upon the results of the review  ongoing year impact analysis and risk assessment will continue as management deems appropriate 
such review also will involve the development of an appropriate contingency plan to help limit the impact of any failure of clients  vendors or other third parties with respect to year compliance 
the company expects to incur internal staff costs as well as consulting and other expenses related to the assessment project but is unable to form an estimate of such costs at this time
