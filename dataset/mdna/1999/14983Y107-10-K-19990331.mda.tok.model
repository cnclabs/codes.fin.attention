item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
air services the company s air courier and airfreight service begins with a customer placing an order  which is then dispatched for pickup 
a tracking number is assigned to the shipment and entered into the company s computer system 
the shipment is then routed based on delivery specifications  destination and timing considerations 
at the final destination  a proof of delivery is obtained to conclude and confirm the delivery  at which time the customer is invoiced 
sales and marketing the company believes that a direct sales force most effectively reaches its customers for same day  time critical delivery services and  accordingly  the company does not currently engage in mass media advertising 
the company markets directly to individual customers by designing and offering customized service packages after determining a customer s specific delivery and distribution requirements 
the company is implementing a coordinated major account strategy by building on established relationships with regional and national customers 
the company also employs certain direct response marketing techniques 
many of the services provided by the company  such as facilities management  dedicated contract logistics and routed delivery services  are determined on the basis of competitive bids 
however  the company believes that quality and service capabilities are also important competitive factors 
in certain instances  the company has obtained business by offering a superior level of service  even though it was not the low bidder for a particular contract 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from customers with whom it has entered into contracts 
virtually all scheduled dedicated vehicle and facilities management services are provided pursuant to contracts 
most of these contracts may be terminated by the customer on relatively short notice without penalty 
competition the market for the company s delivery service is highly competitive 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which it competes are reliability  quality  breadth of service and price 
cdl competes on all such factors 
most of the company s competitors in the time critical ground and air delivery market are privately held companies that operate in only one location or in a limited service area 
however  there is a growing trend toward consolidation in the industry 
in addition to the time critical delivery services provided by cdl  customers also utilize next day and second day services 
the market for next day and second day services is dominated by nationwide network providers  which have built large  capital intensive distribution channels that allow them to process a high volume of materials 
these companies typically have fixed deadlines for next day or second day delivery services 
in contrast  the company specializes in on demand  next flight out deliveries or services which  by their nature  are not governed by rigid time schedules 
if a customer is unable to meet a network provider s established deadline  the company can pick up the shipment  put it on the next available flight and deliver it  in some cases  before the network provider s scheduled delivery time 
the company s services are available twenty four hours a day  seven days a week 
the company obtains space on scheduled airline flights to provide its air services and accordingly does not have to acquire or maintain an expensive fleet of airplanes 
as a result  the company can provide a more flexible  specialized service to its customers without incurring the high fixed overhead that the larger network providers must incur 
acquisitions and divestitures in november the company commenced operations simultaneously with the acquisition of eleven companies providing same day delivery and logistics services 
the aggregate consideration paid by the company was approximately million in cash and  shares of common stock  par value 
per share the common stock  for an aggregate value of approximately million 
in addition to the acquisition of the eleven companies  cdl acquired certain additional assets from two companies in transactions accounted for as purchases 
the assets acquired in those transactions were not material to cdl 
in  the company acquired five additional businesses aggregating approximately million in annual revenues 
the aggregate purchase price paid by the company for these businesses was approximately million  consisting of a combination of cash  seller financed debt and shares of common stock 
the purchase price was subsequently reduced by approximately  due to actual revenue not reaching projected revenue as stipulated in the purchase agreements 
each of the transactions has been accounted for as a purchase 
in  the company did not make any acquisitions and instead focused on internal growth 
consistent with the change in strategic focus  in january  the company sold its contract logistics subsidiary to david mathia  its founder and president  in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with the sale  the company recorded a gain of approximately  before the effect of federal and state income taxes

the aggregate purchase price paid for these businesses was million consisting of a combination of cash  shares of common stock  and seller financed debt 
each of the transactions has been accounted for as a purchase 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in february cdl acquired an air delivery company with annual revenues of approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the price paid for this business was approximately million consisting of a combination of cash  shares of common stock and seller financed debt 
under the terms of the agreement there is the potential for up to  to be paid upon the accomplishment of certain financial and operational objectives 
regulation the company s delivery operations are subject to various state and local regulations and  in many instances  require permits and licenses from state authorities 
to a limited degree  state and local authorities have the power to regulate the delivery of certain types of shipments and operations within certain geographic areas 
interstate and intrastate motor carrier operations are also subject to safety requirements prescribed by the united states department of transportation the dot and by state departments of transportation 
the company s failure to comply with the applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of one or more of the company s operating permits 
safety the company seeks to ensure that all employee drivers meet safety standards established by the company and its insurance carriers as well as the dot 
in addition  where required by the dot or state or local authorities  the company requires independent owner operators utilized by the company to meet certain specified safety standards 
the company reviews prospective drivers in an effort to ensure that they meet applicable requirements 
employees and independent contractors at december   the company employed approximately  people   as drivers or messengers  in operations  in clerical and administrative positions  in sales and in management 
the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements  although the company is subject to union organizing activity from time to time 
the company also had contracts with approximately  independent contractor drivers as of december  the company has not experienced any work stoppages and believes that its relationship with its employees and independent contractor drivers is good 
see risk factors independent contractors and employee owner operators 
risk factors in reading this report  you should consider the following risks carefully 
the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks about which we do not yet know or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  expect  believe  intend  anticipate  estimate  or similar words 
these statements are only predictions and are based on our current beliefs  expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results and events may vary materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we discuss risks and uncertainties that might cause such a difference below and elsewhere in this report 
limited combined operating history we conducted no operations and generated no revenue prior to our ipo in november  at that time  we acquired eleven companies in the same day delivery and logistics business 
since then  we have acquired several additional businesses 
prior to their acquisition by us  the companies that we have acquired were operated as independent entities 
the process of integrating the operations of these businesses into our business may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a significant amount of our financial and other resources  including management time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully into our operations 
in addition  to manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis we must conform all acquired companies into certain necessary common systems and procedures  including computer and accounting systems 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully institute these common systems and procedures for all acquired companies 
our inability to integrate or successfully manage the companies we have acquired or acquire in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to manage growth we expect to expend significant time and effort in expanding our business and acquiring other businesses 
this growth may place a significant strain on our resources 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations as they expand 
any future growth also will impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management  including the need to identify  recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
we cannot be certain that we can identify and retain such additional managers and executives 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our business or manage any future growth effectively and profitably 
risks related to our acquisition strategy in we made no acquisitions 
one of our strategies for  however  was to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our markets through the acquisition of selected companies in the same day ground and air delivery business 
the company added such businesses in and intends to continue its acquisition activity into consistent with that plan  cdl acquired an air delivery company in february we may not  however  be able to identify  acquire or manage profitable additional businesses or integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including o possible adverse effects on our operating results and the timing of those results  o diversion of management s attention  o dependence on retaining  hiring and training of key personnel  o risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  and o the realization of intangible assets 
some or all of these additional risks could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  especially in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition 
if we are unable to acquire additional same day delivery companies or integrate those businesses successfully  our ability to expand our operations and increase our revenues and profitability could be reduced significantly 
risks related to acquisition financing we cannot readily predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts or the capital we will need for these efforts 
we currently intend to finance future acquisitions by using a combination of our common stock  notes and cash 
if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  or if the owners of the businesses we wish to acquire are unwilling to accept common stock as part of the purchase price  we may be required to use more of our cash resources  if available  to maintain our acquisition program 
using cash for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through borrowing money or selling stock 
the company completed a million private placement of senior subordinated notes and warrants in january to be used primarily to finance acquisitions 
the company may not be able to obtain the additional cash we will need for our future acquisition program on acceptable terms  or at all 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our revolving credit facility currently restricts our ability to make acquisitions 
risks associated with the same day delivery industry  general economic conditions our revenues and earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect the delivery services industry  including o extreme weather conditions  o equipment failures o economic factors affecting our significant customers  o increases in fuel prices  and o shortages of or disputes with labor 
any of these factors could make it more difficult for us to service our clients effectively 
demand for our services may also be negatively impacted by down turns in the level of general economic activity and employment dependence on technology our business is dependent upon several different information and telecommunications technologies 
we have entered into a contract with computer associates  inc in march  to develop new software to facilitate order processing and tracking 
if we are not able to process transactions accurately and quickly  we may lose our customers and our reputation may be diminished 
we intend to integrate these separate operating systems of our subsidiaries into an integrated company wide system 
we may encounter unexpected delays and costs in integrating and converting these systems 
we may be unable to complete our software development plan in a timely or economic manner 
in addition  the developed software may fail to perform the order processing and tracking services contemplated by our information technology strategy or customer demand for the intended software applications may decrease or be insufficient to support the technology related capital investment we make 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
independent contractors and employee owners operators federal and state authorities have from time to time asserted that independent contractors in the transportation industry  including those used by the company  are employees rather than independent contractors 
we believe that the independent contractors we use are not employees under existing interpretations of federal and state laws 
federal and state authorities could challenge this position and laws  including tax laws  and interpretations of various laws  may change 
if the company were required to pay for and administer added benefits to independent contractors  our operating costs could substantially increase 
in addition  certain of our employees own and operate their own vehicles 
the company is presently undergoing an employment tax examination by the internal revenue service the irs 
the examination covers certain payments made during the  and tax years to employee owner operators for all or a portion of the costs of operating their vehicles in the course of their employment 
the company believes that these arrangements do not represent additional compensation to those employees 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not seek to recharacterize some or all of such payments as additional compensation 
if such amounts were recharacterized  the company could have to pay additional employment related taxes on such amounts 
claims exposure we use approximately  independent contractor and employee drivers in our business 
these drivers are involved in accidents from time to time 
we currently carry liability insurance of  for each accident subject to applicable deductibles 
we also carry umbrella coverage up to million and require our independent contractors to maintain liability insurance of at least the minimum amounts required by state and federal law 
we cannot guarantee that claims against us will not exceed the amount of coverage 
if there were a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  liability claims or workers compensation claims against us  or unfavorable resolutions of those claims  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
significant increases in insurance costs could reduce our profitability 
shares eligible for future sales sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market could cause the market price of the common stock to drop 
as of march    shares of common stock were issued and outstanding 
in addition   shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise or conversion of stock options  convertible notes or debentures and the company s employee stock purchase plan   of which have been registered for resale by the holders and are freely tradable upon issuance and  of which are subject to registration rights pursuant to which the holders can cause the company to register those shares for resale 
sale in the market of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that sales might occur  could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
if all of these shares were issued they would represent of the company s issued and outstanding shares 
any sales of these shares may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future when and at a price that we deem appropriate 
reliance on key personnel our future success will depend in part upon the continued service of our senior management and on the senior management of companies that we acquire in the future 
if any of these people decide not to continue in their employment with us  or if we are unable to attract and retain other skilled employees  our business could be adversely affected 
competition we believe that the markets for the same day ground and air delivery services we provide are highly competitive 
price competition is often intense  especially in the market for basic delivery services 
we compete with a large number of other air delivery and ground courier service entities 
while we believe that we compete effectively with these other entities  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our competitive position in our principal markets 
permits and licensing our delivery operations are subject to various state  local and federal regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines or could lead to the revocation of our authority to conduct certain of our operations 
no future dividends we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain any future earnings for use in our business 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
effect of certain charter provisions certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as currently in effect  as well as delaware law  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of the company or limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without further stockholder action 
the existence of this preferred stock could discourage a third party from attempting to obtain control of the company and may also cause the market price of the common stock to drop 
we have no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain persons from engaging in business combinations with us 
our current by laws provide for a staggered board of directors  which means that only one third of the board will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders item properties as of december   the company operated from fifty eight leased facilities excluding six authorized sales agent locations 
these facilities are principally used for operations  general and administrative functions and training 
in addition  several facilities also contain storage and warehouse space

furthermore  the company believes that suitable additional or replacement space will be available when required 
as of december   the company owned or leased approximately cars and trucks of various types  which are primarily operated by drivers employed by the company 
in addition  certain of the company s employee drivers own or lease their own vehicles 
the company also hires independent contractors who typically provide their own vehicles and are required to carry at least the minimum amount of insurance required by state law 
the company s aggregate rental expense for the year ended december  was approximately million

as a result of the above  operating income increased for the year ended december  by million from a loss of million in to an operating profit of million in when excluding the results of the company s contract logistics subsidiary that was sold in early  operating income would have increased million 
the gain recognized by the company on the aforementioned sale of its contract logistics subsidiary in january amounted to  before applicable taxes
