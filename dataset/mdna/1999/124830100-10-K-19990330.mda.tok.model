such laws typically impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such substances 
the costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to promptly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person 
certain laws also impose requirements on conditions and activities that may affect the environment or the impact of the environment on human health 
failure to comply with such requirements could result in the imposition of monetary penalties in addition to the costs to achieve compliance and potential liabilities to third parties 
among other things  certain laws require abatement or removal of friable and certain non friable asbestos containing materials acms in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling 
certain laws regarding acms require building owners and lessees  among other things  to notify and train certain employees working in areas known or presumed to contain acms

all of the properties but not properties for which the company holds an option to purchase but does not yet own have been subject to phase i environmental assessments or updates of existing phase i environmental assessments within approximately the last six years 
such assessments generally consisted of a visual inspection of the properties  review of federal and state environmental databases and certain information regarding historic uses of the property and adjacent areas and the preparation and issuance of written reports 
some of the properties contain  or contained  underground storage tanks ust s used for storing petroleum products or wastes typically associated with automobile service or other operations conducted at the properties 
however  certain environmental conditions are being evaluated at the recently acquired parkway city mall in huntsville  alabama a joint venture property 
there appears to be a high potential for adverse environmental conditions  specifically total petroleum hydrocarbons  in the vicinity of an auto service center which had usts 
the company has ordered additional engineering studies and as part of the redevelopment is proceeding to correct the environmental conditions at the site 
certain properties contain  or contained  dry cleaning establishments utilizing solvents 
where believed to be warranted  samplings of building materials or subsurface investigations were  or  with respect to one property  will be undertaken 
at certain properties  where warranted by the conditions  the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance program that establishes operating procedures with respect to acms 
the costs associated with the development and implementation for such programs were not material 
although there can be no assurances that such environmental liability does not exist  other than parkway city in huntsville  alabama  none of the environmental assessments have identified and the company is not aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties in which the company or the operating partnership has or had an interest whether as an owner or operator that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
nevertheless  it is possible that the environmental assessments available to the company do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities  that subsequent investigations will identify material contamination  that adverse environmental conditions have arisen subsequent to the performance of the environmental assessments  or that there are material environmental liabilities of which management is unaware 
moreover  no assurances can be given that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of the properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the properties or by third parties unrelated to the company  the operating partnership or the relevant property partnership 
the existence of any such environmental liability could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flow and the funds available to the company to pay dividends 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
general risks of the company s business general factors affecting investments in shopping center properties and effect of economic and real estate conditions a shopping center s revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national and regional economic climates  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of retail space  perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center  and the willingness and ability of the shopping center s owner to provide capable management and maintenance services 
in addition  other factors may adversely affect a shopping center s value without affecting its current revenues  including changes in governmental regulations  zoning or tax laws  potential environmental or other legal liabilities  availability of financing  and changes in interest rate levels 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at the properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  outlet malls  wholesale clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition could adversely affect the operating partnership s revenues and funds available for distribution to partners  which in turn will affect the company s revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders

the operating partnership or an affiliate of the company is the managing general partner of the property partnerships that own such properties  except for the governor s square mall and its associated center  governor s plaza  in which affiliates of the operating partnership are non managing general partners 
where the operating partnership serves as managing general partner of property partnerships  it may have certain fiduciary responsibilities to the other partners in those partnerships 
in certain cases  the approval or consent of the other partners is required before the operating partnership may sell  finance  expand or make other significant changes in the operations of such properties 
to the extent such approvals or consents are required  the operating partnership may experience difficulty in  or may be prevented from implementing its plans with respect to expansion  development  financing or other similar transactions with respect to such properties 
with respect to governor s square and governor s plaza  the operating partnership does not have day to day operational control or control over certain major decisions  including the timing and amount of distributions and decisions relating to sales  expansions and financings  which could result in decisions by the managing general partner that do not fully reflect the interests of the company  including decisions relating to the standards that the company is required to satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes 
dependence on significant properties hamilton place and coolsprings galleria accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total revenues of the company for the period ended december  the company s financial position and results of operations will therefore be disproportionately affected by the results experienced at these properties

it is the objective of the company s management to achieve growth in funds from operations through the aggressive management of the company s existing properties  the expansion and renovation of existing properties  the development of new properties  and select acquisitions 
funds from operations can also be affected by external factors  such as inflation  fluctuations in interest rates or changes in general economic conditions  which are beyond the control of the company s management 
funds from operations is defined by the company as net income loss before property depreciation  other non cash items consisting of the write off of costs associated with development projects not being pursued  gains or losses on sales of real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
the cost of interest rate caps and finance costs on the company s lines of credit are amortized and included in interest expense and  therefore  reduces funds from operations 
funds from operations also includes the company s share of funds from operations in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of funds from operations in consolidated properties 
the company complies with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit revised definition of funds from operations by not adding back to income from operations depreciation and amortization of finance costs and non real estate assets 
the company excludes outparcel sales from its funds from operations calculation  even though the nareit definition allows their inclusion 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principals gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available from operations to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company classifies its regional malls into two categories stabilized malls stabilized malls which have completed their initial lease up and new malls new malls which are in their initial lease up phase or are being redeveloped 
at year end the new mall category was comprised of westgate mall in spartanburg  south carolina  which was renovated and expanded and reopened in october  oak hollow mall in high point  north carolina which opened in august  springdale mall in mobile  alabama which was acquired in september and which is being redeveloped and retenanted  bonita lakes mall in meridian  mississippi which opened in october and parkway city mall in huntsville  alabama which was acquired in december  and which is being redeveloped

regional mall development sites were being pursued in georgia  mississippi and south carolina and community shopping center sites were being pursued in georgia  florida  kentucky  tennessee and virginia 
in general  the company seeks out development opportunities in middle market trade areas that it believes are under serviced by existing retail facilities  have demonstrated improving demographic trends or otherwise afford an opportunity for effective market penetration and competitive presence 
bullet acquiring existing retail properties where cash flow can be enhanced by improved management  leasing  redevelopment and expansion 
management believes that an opportunity for growth exists through the acquisition of shopping centers that meet the company s investment criteria and targeted returns 
in general  the company seeks to acquire well located shopping centers in middle market geographic areas consistent with management s experience where management believes significant value can be created through its development  leasing and management expertise 
on january   the company purchased asheville mall in asheville  north carolina for million  which was funded by a million acquisition loan with the balance funded from the company s credit lines 
on january   the company purchased burnsville center in minneapolis burnsville  minnesota for million which was funded by a million acquisition loan with the balance funded from the company s credit lines

excess loan proceeds of million were used to pay down the company s credit lines 
risks associated with the company s growth strategy in connection with the implementation of this growth strategy  the company and the operating partnership will incur various risks including the risk that development or expansion opportunities explored by the company and the operating partnership may be abandoned  the risk that construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project not profitable  the risk that the company and the operating partnership may not be able to refinance construction loans which are generally with full recourse to the company and the operating partnership  the risk that occupancy rates and rents at a completed project will not meet projections  and will therefore be insufficient to make the project profitable  and the need for anchor  mortgage lender and property partner approvals for certain expansion activities 
in the event of an unsuccessful development project  the company s and the operating partnership s loss could exceed its investment in the project 
the company has in the past elected not to proceed with certain development projects and anticipates that it will do so again from time to time in the future 
if the company elects not to proceed with a development opportunity  the development costs associated therewith ordinarily will be charged against income for the then current period 
any such charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken 
competition there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
the malls are generally located in middle markets 
management believes that the malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only or largest enclosed malls within their respective trade areas 
in addition  retailers at the properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  outlet malls  wholesale clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition could adversely affect the operating partnership s revenues and funds available for distributions to partners  which in turn will affect the company s revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with tenant sales achieving the highest levels during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
the malls earn most of their temporary rents rents from short term tenants during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year 
qualification as a real estate investment trust the company has elected to be taxed as real estate investment trust under the code  commencing with its taxable year ended december   and will seek to maintain such status 
as a qualified real estate investment trust  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes at least of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders 
if the company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates

clair square and foothills mall acquired in and malls acquired in and were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the malls are generally located in middle markets 
management believes that the malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only or largest enclosed malls within their respective trade areas 
trade areas have been identified by management based upon a number of sources of information  including the location of other malls  publicly available population information  customer surveys  surveys of customer automobile license plates  as well as zip codes and third party market studies

except for these projects and as further described below  the company currently has no other capital commitments 
it is management s expectation that the company will continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and grow its business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken by the company as suitable opportunities arise 
such activities are not expected to be undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved 
the company will fund its major development  expansion and acquisition activity with its traditional sources of construction and permanent debt financing as well as from other debt and equity financings  including public financings  and its credit facilities 
other capital expenditures management prepares an annual capital expenditure budget for each property which is intended to provide for all necessary recurring capital improvements and maintenance items 
management believes that its annual operating reserve for maintenance and recurring capital improvements as well as reimbursements from tenants will provide the necessary funding for such requirements 
the company intends to distribute approximately to of its funds from operations with the remaining to to be held as a reserve for capital expenditures and continued growth opportunities 
major tenant finish costs for currently vacant space are expected to be funded with working capital  operating reserves  or revolving lines of credit  and a return on the funds so invested is expected to be earned 
for the year ended december   revenue generating capital expenditures  or tenant allowances for improvements  were million 
these capital expenditures generate a return by increased rents from these tenants over the term of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  or remodeling and renovation costs  were million  the majority of which was for the renovation of hamilton place in chattanooga  tennessee 
revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as parking lot and roof repairs  which are recovered from the tenants  were million in the company believes that the properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the handling  discharge and emission of hazardous or toxic substances 
however  certain environmental conditions are being evaluated at the recently acquired parkway city mall in huntsville  alabama 
there appears to be a high potential for adverse environmental conditions  specifically total petroleum hydrocarbons  in the vicinity of an auto service center which had underground storage tanks 
the company has ordered additional engineering studies and as part of the redevelopment is proceeding to correct the environmental conditions at the site 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority  and is not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the cash provided from the operations of twelve new centers and the acquisition of fourteen centers in the last twenty four months 
cash flows used in investing activities for increased by million  or  to million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of eleven centers in and the company s development program partially offset by a draw on escrow funds in january cash flows provided by financing activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase is primarily due to increased borrowings related to the development and acquisition programs partially offset by the proceeds from the june preferred stock offering which were used to pay down borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents from the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
year the year problem results from the use of a two digit year date instead of a four digit date in the programs that operate computers  information processing technology and systems and other devices ie non information processing systems such as elevators  utility monitoring systems and time clocks that use computer chips 
systems with a year problem have programs that were written to assume that the first two digits for any date used in the program would always be 
unless corrected  this assumption may result in computer programs misinterpreting the date january  as january  this could cause systems to incorrectly process critical financial and operational information  generate erroneous information or fail altogether 
the company s state of readiness for year the company has completed a program to identify both its information and non information processing applications that are not year compliant 
as a result of this identification program  the company believes that its core accounting applications and the majority of non information processing applications are year compliant 
certain of its other information and non information processing applications were not yet year compliant 
the company corrected or replaced all non compliant systems and applications including embedded systems  by the end of the company has initiated communications with its significant suppliers and tenants to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of such parties to correct their year compliance issues 
in addition  the company has formed a year committee that includes senior personnel from most areas of the company 
these people are charged with the duty of determining the extent of the company s ongoing exposure and taking the appropriate action to minimize any impact on the company s operations 
costs to address the company s year issue the company does not expect to incur any significant costs to ensure the compliance of all information processing systems and non information processing systems including embedded systems 
risks relating to the year issue and contingency plans although the company is not currently aware of any specific significant year problems involving third party vendors or suppliers  the company believes that its most significant potential risk relating to the year issue is in regard to such third parties 
for example  the company believes there could be failure in the information systems of certain service providers that the company relies upon for electrical  telephone and data transmission and banking services 
the company believes that any service disruption with respect to these providers due to a year issue would be of a short term nature 
the company has existing back up systems and procedures  developed primarily for natural disasters  that could be utilized on a short term basis to address any service interruptions 
in addition  with respect to tenants  a failure of their information systems could delay the payment of rents or even impair their ability to operate 
these tenant problems are likely to be isolated and would likely not impact the operations of any particular shopping center or the company as a whole 
while it is not possible at this time to determine the likely impact of any of these potential problems  the company will continue to evaluate these areas and develop additional contingency plans  as appropriate 
therefore  although the company believes that its year issues have been addressed and that suitable remediation and or contingency procedures will be in place by december   there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement sfas no 
as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance that is  fiscal quarters beginning june  and thereafter 
sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
sfas no 
must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantialy modified after december  and  at the company s election  before january  
the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements and has not determined the timing or method of adoption of sfas no 
however  sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the properties 
ffo is defined by the company as net income loss before property depreciation  other non cash items consisting of the write off of costs associated with development projects not being pursued  gains or losses on sales of real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
the cost of interest rate caps and finance costs on the company s lines of credit are amortized and included in interest expense and  therefore  reduces ffo 
ffo also includes the company s share of ffo in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of ffo in consolidated properties 
the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the operating partnership and the company 
accordingly  management expects that ffo will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners including the company 
management also believes that ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits and provides a relevant basis for comparison among companies 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as  defined by generally accepted accounting principles  is not necessarily indicative of cash from operations available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in  ffo increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in the increase in ffo was primarily attributable to the continuing increase in revenues and income from operations from new developments and acquisitions 
beginning with the first quarter of the company amended its calculation of ffo to include straight line rents in accordance with nareit s  definition of ffo 
the company has restated prior years ffo to conform with the revised calculation 
the company excludes outparcel sales which would have added million in from its ffo calculation  even though the nareit definition allows their inclusion 
the company s calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands except per share data three months ended year ended december  december  income from operations 


















    add depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties 













    income from operations of unconsolidated affiliates 














  depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated affiliates 














  write off of development costs charged to net income 
















subtract minority investors share of income from operations in ten properties 










minority investor s share of depreciation and amortization ten properties 




















depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets and finance costs 




















preferred dividends
