in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  the company would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the proposed paulson merger was specifically excluded from the defined transactions which would be considered a change in control 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  iii enter into certain transactions with affiliates  iv create certain liens  v sell certain assets  and vi enter into certain mergers and consolidations

year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation is generally referred to as the year problem 
if such situation occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems and other systems for the purpose of assessing its potential year problem  and is in the process of modifying or replacing those systems which are not year compliant 
based upon this review  management believes such systems will be compliant by mid calendar however  if modifications are not made or not completed timely  the year problem could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
all costs related to the year problem are expensed as incurred  while the cost of new hardware and software is capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
the costs associated with year compliance have not been and are not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as of december   the company has incurred costs of approximately  primarily for internal labor related to the system applications and anticipates spending an additional  to become year compliant 
the estimated completion date and remaining costs are based upon management s best estimates  as well as third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that such estimates will occur and actual results could differ 
in addition  the company has communicated with its major vendors and suppliers to determine their state of readiness relative to the year problem and the company s possible exposure to year issues of such third parties 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  which the company s systems may rely upon  will be timely converted or representations made to the company by these parties are accurate 
as a result the failure of a major vendor or supplier to adequately address their year problem could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
planning for the year problem  including contingency planning  is significantly complete and will be revised  if necessary
