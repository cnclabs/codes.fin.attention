the company s principal products are individual fixed  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies which consist of nursing home care  home health care  medicare supplement and long term disability insurance 
the company s underwriting practices rely upon the base of experience  which it has developed over twenty four years of providing nursing home care insurance  as well as upon available industry and actuarial information 
as the home health care market has developed  the company has encouraged the purchase of both nursing home care and home health care coverage  and has introduced new life insurance products as well  thus providing policyholders with enhanced protection while broadening the company s policy base 
in late  the company introduced its personal freedom plan and assisted living plan 
both plans are designed to provide comprehensive nursing home and home health care coverage 
during  the company developed its secured risk nursing facility and post acute recovery plans  which provide limited benefits to higher risk applicants 
long term nursing home care and home health care policies accounted for approximately of the company s total annualized premiums in force as of december  and approximately of its consolidated revenues for the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of each state in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
premiums charged for insurance products must be approved by state regulatory authorities 
in addition  the company and its insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported losses  as well as estimated future benefits payable under the company s insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
the company s results of operations are affected significantly by the following factors level of required reserves for policies in force 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
claim reserves reflect actual experience through the most recent time period and policy reserves reflect expectations of claims related to a block of business over its entire life 
the company compares actual experience with estimates and adjusts its reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
revisions to reserves are reflected in the company s results of operations through benefits to policyholder s expense 
policy premium levels 
the company attempts to set premium levels to ensure profitability  subject to the constraints of competitive market conditions and state regulatory approvals 
deferred acquisition costs 
in connection with the sale of its insurance policies  the company defers and amortizes a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses directly related to the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing policy reserves 
deferred acquisition costs can be affected by unanticipated termination of policies because  upon such unanticipated termination  the company is required to expense fully the deferred acquisition costs associated with the terminated policy 
the number of years a policy has been in effect 
claims costs tend to be higher on policies that have been in force for a longer period of time 
as the policy ages  it is more likely that the insured will have need for services covered by the policy 
however  the longer the policy is in effect  the more premium the company will receive 
invesment income 
the company s investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade fixed income securities 
income generated from this portfolio is largely dependent upon prevailing levels of interest rates 
due to the longevity of the company s investment portfolio duration approximately years  investment interest income does not immediately reflect changes in market interest rates 
however  the company is susceptible to changes in market rates when cash flows from maturing investments are reinvested at prevailing market rates 
as of december   approximately of the company s invested assets were committed to high quality large capitalization common stocks 
other factors which affect the company s results of operations are lapsation and persistency  both of which relate to the renewal of insurance policies  and first year compared to renewal premiums 
lapsation is the termination of a policy by nonrenewal and  pursuant to the company s policy  is automatic if and when premiums become more than days overdue  however  policies may be reinstated  if approved by the company  within six months after the policy lapses 
persistency represents the percentage of premiums renewed  which the company calculates by dividing the total annual premiums at the end of each year less first year business for that year by the total annual premiums in force for the prior year 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in total annual premiums in force at the end of any year would be a result of non renewal of policies  including those policies that have terminated by reason of death  lapse due to nonpayment of premiums  and or conversion to other policies offered by the company 
first year premiums are premiums covering the first twelve months a policy is in force 
renewal premiums are premiums covering all subsequent periods

this resulted in a higher loss ratio for the remaining growth in benefits is attributable to new premium growth 
management expects the loss ratio to increase with time due to the impact of a maturing portfolio

sfas establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share  and simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in accounting principles board opinion no 
 earnings per share 
sfas prescribes that for all financial statements with effective dates after december   primary and fully diluted earnings per share will be replaced with basic and diluted earnings per share  and these amounts are required to be shown on the face of the income statement 
prior year per share amounts must also be restated if applicable

year as many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the year  they may be unable to accurately process certain data before  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
the yk issue can arise at any point in the company s supply  billing  processing  sales or financial chains 
the company and each of its subsidiaries are in the process of implementing a yk readiness program with the objective of having all of their significant operations functioning properly with respect to yk before january  the first component of the yk project was to identify all systems and hardware  which would be impacted by the yk issue 
this portion of the project has been completed for the company and for all of its subsidiaries 
the second component of the yk project involves the actual remediation and replacement of various systems and hardware  which will be affected by the yk issue 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are using both internal and external resources to complete this process 
each system has been assigned a priority for yk completion  beginning with the most critical projects 
all application systems that are not yk compliant have been slated for replacement with a new yk compliant system 
the company expects to complete the installation and conversion to these new systems by the summer of as part of the yk project  significant service providers  vendors  suppliers  and customers that are believed to be critical to business operations after january   have been identified and steps are being undertaken in an attempt to reasonably ascertain their level of readiness through questionnaires  interviews  on site visits and other available means 
because of the reliance upon new application systems to alleviate the risk of business operations due to the yk issue  the company cannot guarantee that these systems will be implemented successfully or in a timely fashion 
in the event that one or all of these new system conversions are unsuccessful  the company could experience interruptions in its business operations  which are critical to its ongoing profitability and sustainability 
however  the company believes that its efforts in converting to new systems will be successful  and does not anticipate any failures or unnecessary delays in its critical functions as a result of the yk issue 
by the end of the second quarter   the company will review its progress in the completion of yk preparedness  both on in house systems and external vendors 
in the event either is not expected to be completed prior to january   the company will correct its existing systems which are substantially yk compliant already and or seek other vendors which are compliant 
since january  the company has been testing its system using yk dates and has not experienced any difficulties or problems 
any policy written with an annual collection of premium has been successfully processed since january  with no interruption of services 
the company has spent approximately  to date related to modifying existing systems to become yk compliant  and anticipates the expenditure of approximately  more before the end of the third quarter  the company estimates that this amount represents approximately of its total information technology budget 
the majority of the company s efforts and expenditures have related to the installation of a new computer system  which  although correcting for yk issues  is being implemented for normal processing reasons rather than for yk 
the company expects the impact of yk to have no material impact upon its financial condition and results of operations

the company s continued growth is dependent upon its ability to i continue marketing efforts to expand its historical markets  ii continue to expand its network of agents and effectively market its products in states where its insurance subsidiaries are currently licensed and iii fund such marketing and expansion while at the same time maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
management believes that the funds necessary to accomplish the foregoing  including funds required to maintain adequate levels of statutory surplus in the company s insurance subsidiaries can be met through by funds generated from its most recent stock offering  the company s issuance of convertible subordinated debt and from operations 
the company s expects future capital market activities will be necessary to support an ongoing growth 
in the event i the company fails to maintain minimum loss ratios calculated in accordance with statutory guidelines  ii the company fails to meet other requirements mandated and enforced by regulatory authorities  iii the company has adverse claims experience in the future  iv the company is unable to obtain additional financing to support future growth  or v the economy continues to affect the buying powers of senior citizens  the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected
