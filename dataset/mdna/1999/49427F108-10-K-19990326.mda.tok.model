overview and background the company  which owns  operates and develops office and industrial real estate  primarily in southern california  commenced operations in january and operates as a self administered reit 
the company succeeded to the real estate business of the kilroy group  the company s predecessor 
the kilroy group had been engaged in the acquisition  management  financing  construction and leasing of office and industrial properties and providing development services to third party owners for a fee 
the combined financial statements of the kilroy group comprise the operations  assets and liabilities of the properties contributed to the company in connection with its formation  the formation of operating partnership and completion of the company s initial public offering ipo  collectively  the formation transactions  on january  the company owns its interests in all of its properties through the operating partnership and the finance partnership  and conducts substantially all of its operations through the operating partnership 
the company owned an and general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december  and  respectively 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from rental income  including tenant reimbursements 
while the company s revenue growth in and was due primarily to the completion of million and million of acquisitions  respectively  the market for property acquisitions has become more competitive 
as a result  management believes that the most significant part of the company s revenue growth over the next two to three years will come from its substantial development pipeline 
management also believes that continued improvement of the real estate market in the company s principal markets and the continued economic expansion of southern california  which continues to lead the state in both job and economic growth  will result in strong demand for office and industrial space 
consequently  management currently expects that the company s revenue in the next one to two years will also grow as a result of re leasing  at higher lease rates  approximately million square feet of office space and million square feet of industrial space currently subject to leases expiring during the next two years 
in addition  the company intends to continue its leadership as a low cost operator through integrated operations and disciplined cost management

in addition  the company completed million in property development consisting of the renovation of two buildings encompassing  rentable square feet  the construction of two buildings encompassing  rentable square feet and the construction of three buildings encompassing  rentable square feet which were completed except for tenant improvements at december  the company s policy is to include properties in its stabilized portfolio upon the earlier of one year from the date of substantial completion or the date the property reaches stabilized occupancy of

the portfolio occupancy rate at december  was  with the office and industrial properties and occupied  respectively  as of such date 
the company s management believes that in order to provide meaningful historical analysis of the financial statements  certain adjustments must be made to the historical kilroy group financial statements to make accounting periods comparable 
accordingly  the results of operations for the period january  to january  have been adjusted to reflect interest income  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and extraordinary gains as if the formation transactions had been consummated on january  year ended december  compared to year ended december   as adjusted year ended december  dollar percentage change change as adjusted dollars in thousands revenues rental income    tenant reimbursements    development services interest income    other income   total revenues    expenses property expenses    real estate taxes    general and administrative    ground leases   development expense provision for potentially unrecoverable pre development costs   interest expense    depreciation and amortization    total expenses    income before equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiary  minority interests and extraordinary gains

year the year issue yk refers to the inability of certain computer systems  as well as certain hardware and equipment containing date sensitive data  to recognize accurate dates commencing on or after january  this has the potential to affect those systems adversely 
in  the company s information technology committee  which is comprised of representatives from senior management and various departments including accounting  property management and management information systems  identified three phases in the company s yk efforts discovery and assessment  remediation and implementation  and testing and verification 
although many of the phases are being completed simultaneously  the following sections describe the activities that the company has or expects to perform to meet its yk objectives  as well as management s assessment of the company s risk of non compliance 
the company s state of readiness the initial phase of discovery and assessment consists of evaluating and identifying all of the company s information technology and non information technology systems that contain date sensitive data 
the following summary describes the classifications of systems that were identified and the company s current state of readiness for each classification 
information technology systems the company s information technology systems fall into three general categories accounting and property management systems  network operating systems  and desktop software 
the company replaced its accounting and property management system  acquired all new network hardware and software  and updated all of its desktop systems and software after its ipo in early the new accounting and property management system  which was tested upon its implementation in  and all the company s network hardware and software  desktop systems and software packages are yk compliant as asserted by the software vendors 
management believes there is no material yk exposure with respect to its information technology systems 
building management systems the company has identified five categories of building management systems that could have potential yk exposure building automation eg  hvac  security card access  fire and life safety  elevator  and office equipment 
during  property management executives and personnel began gathering data to identify all of the company s yk sensitive building management systems and to assess whether such systems are currently yk compliant or will need to be modified or replaced 
management expects to complete the discovery and assessment phase and be able to determine the company s state of readiness as to building management systems by may in addition  management expects to complete the remediation and implementation phase by september and the testing and verification by the end of fiscal year costs to address the company s yk efforts since the replacement of the accounting and property management system  the acquisition of new network hardware and software  and the installation of updated desktop systems and software was performed as a result of the company becoming a publicly traded reit and not in response to yk compliance issues  and further  since phase of the building management systems efforts are being performed by salaried company employees who are not paid for overtime and who management expects will spend of their annual working hours over a two to three year period focusing on yk compliance issues  yk costs incurred to date have been minimal and have not been material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
while expected future costs  which will include costs to complete phases and for the building management systems  are not readily quantifiable at this time  it is management s belief that a significant portion of such costs will be treated as operating expenses and will be reimbursable to the company under most tenant leases 
consequently  management does not believe that such expenses will have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
efforts to identify the yk issues of significant third parties due to the company s diverse tenant base  the success of the company s business is not closely tied to the success of any one particular tenant 
in addition  the success of the company s business is also not closely tied to the operations of any one vendor  supplier or manufacturer 
however  the company is in the process of surveying significant tenants  vendors  suppliers and other relevant third parties to determine that their systems will be yk compliant and that the company s normal operations will continue without interruption 
management anticipates this project will be completed by september the risks of yk non compliance management does not believe that the impact of the yk issue will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
this belief is based upon both the analysis of the company s yk issues and the company s assessment of the yk exposure related to tenants  vendors  and other significant third parties as discussed above 
no assurance can be given about facts and resultant effects of yk issues unknown to the company at this time 
the company s worst case yk scenario would be that the company s information and building management systems fail 
in the event that the company s information systems fail  the company would be forced to manually perform its accounting and property management record keeping functions until the information systems could be restored 
in the event that the company s building management systems fail  the company s tenants would not have access to or be able to conduct their normal business activities at the company s properties until the building management systems could be restored 
these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
developing contingency plans the company does not currently have a contingency plan in place in the event of a yk failure 
such a contingency plan is expected to be developed by the end of the third quarter distribution policy the company makes quarterly distributions to common stockholders from cash available for distribution and  if necessary to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain its reit status  may use borrowings under the credit facility 
all such distributions are at the discretion of the board of directors 
amounts accumulated for distribution are invested primarily in interest bearing accounts and short term interest bearing securities  which are consistent with the company s intention to maintain its qualification as a reit 
such investments may include  for example  obligations of the government national mortgage association  other governmental agency securities  certificates of deposit and interest bearing bank deposits
