on january   the company announced the completion of a million private placement of convertible preferred stock 
the preferred stock is convertible into shares of the company s common stock  at the option of the holder  up to two years from the issue date 
conversion is mandatory for securities still outstanding two years from the issue date 
the conversion price is based on the average market price of the company s common stock prior to conversion  as defined  and is adjusted over time to provide an annual return to the holders 
the conversion price is also subject to ceiling and floor limitations  which may be adjusted based on the company s financial performance 
concurrent with this issuance  the company issued  warrants to purchase the company s common stock at per share 
these warrants expire five years from the issue date 
the net proceeds received from the convertible preferred stock issuance were approximately million and were used to pay down existing borrowings 
in order to maintain adequate cash reserves and credit facilities to meet its anticipated working capital  capital expenditure  and business investment requirements  the company is currently reviewing several new proposals to replace its existing revolving loan agreement 
completion of this transaction  which will offer a longer term banking relationship with more advantageous terms and conditions  is expected early in the second quarter of year many existing computer systems use only the last two digits to identify a year 
consequently  as the year approaches  many systems do not yet recognize the difference between the years and this  as well as other date related processing issues  may cause systems to fail or malfunction 
as a result  the year yk issue may affect the company s products and normal business activities 
the company began addressing the yk issue in early and has assembled a yk evaluation team that is endorsed by  and includes members of  senior management 
a budget has been prepared for yk costs and progress reports are presented to senior management on a regular basis 
the yk evaluation team has developed and implemented a comprehensive yk readiness plan for the company s products and operations 
the objectives of the yk evaluation team are as follows develop a yk compliance standard for the company s plato courseware and software products and determine compliance with that standard  advise on compliance of third party courseware  operating system  and hardware products based on representations by vendors of these products  determine compliance for the company s internal systems including information technology it systems  such as financial and order entry systems  and non it systems  such as telephones and other office equipment  determine the yk readiness of key business partners that the company relies on for normal business operations 
the company has developed a compliance standard based on common testing methodology 
existing plato courseware and software products are currently being reviewed to determine compliance with that standard 
the most current compliance and remediation information is maintained on the company s internet web site 
plato products currently under development are being designed to be yk compliant 
the company also sells various third party courseware  operating system  and hardware products 
yk compliance information has been received from key vendors of third party courseware products and this information is maintained on the company s internet web site 
web links to key vendors of third party operating system and hardware products are also provided 
the company has been taking  and will continue to take  actions necessary to resolve yk issues with its internal it and non it systems  including planned replacements and upgrades 
major computers  applications  and related equipment have been reviewed and are either compliant or software upgrades have been ordered and will be installed in the company s accounting and data processing system was not yk compliant and was recently upgraded to a version that the vendor has indicated is yk compliant 
the company relies on key business partners for its normal business operations and has contacted them regarding yk readiness 
while the company is confident these partners are preparing for the year  it has no control over their preparations and there is no assurance that they will be successful in addressing all yk issues 
while the company s yk costs incurred to date have not been material  additional costs will be incurred as yk readiness is completed in mid based on information currently available  management expects these additional costs to be immaterial as well 
while the company is dedicating existing internal resources toward attaining yk readiness  there is no assurance that it will be successful in addressing all yk issues 
if the company does not achieve yk readiness  there could be significant adverse effects on its results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
for example if the company s plato products are not yk compliant  it could suffer increased costs  lost sales or other negative consequences resulting from customer dissatisfaction  including litigation 
if the company s internal systems are not yk compliant  financial and customer information  orders and product shipments could be delayed and customer support could be interrupted 
if the company s customers do not achieve yk readiness  sales and cash receipts may be delayed 
if the company s key business partners and other third parties do not achieve yk readiness  its ability to receive supplies  ship products  process cash receipts  and conduct other ongoing business activities may be affected 
based on the progress the company has made to date in addressing yk issues  management does not expect significant risks with its yk compliance at this time 
as the company s plan is to address its major yk issues prior to being affected by them  it has not developed comprehensive yk related contingency plans 
if progress deviates from plan or significant risks are identified  the company will consider contingency plans as deemed necessary 
this yk discussion is based on the company s best estimates using the information that is currently available  and is subject to change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates
