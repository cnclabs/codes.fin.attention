all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
forward looking statements certain statements made in this form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of pertaining to management s current expectations as to farmer mac s future financial results  business prospects and business developments 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements  and typically are accompanied by  and identified with  such terms as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  should and similar phrases 
the following management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements addressing farmer mac s prospects for earnings and growth in loan purchase  guarantee and securitization volume  trends in net interest income and provision for losses  changes in capital position  year readiness efforts  and other business and financial matters 
management s expectations for farmer mac s future necessarily involve a number of assumptions  estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties 
various factors could cause farmer mac s actual results or events to differ materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the forward looking statements  including uncertainties regarding the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans  the possible establishment of additional statutory or regulatory restrictions applicable to farmer mac  such as the imposition of regulatory risk based capital requirements in excess of statutory minimum and critical capital levels or restrictions on farmer mac s investment authority  substantial changes in interest rates  agricultural land values  commodity prices and the general economy  protracted adverse weather  market or other conditions affecting particular geographic regions or particular commodities related to agricultural mortgage loans backing farmer mac guaranteed securities  the non compliance of farmer mac s internal systems or the systems of critical vendors with respect to the year date change  legislative or regulatory developments or interpretations of farmer mac s statutory charter that could adversely affect farmer mac or the ability of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms of any such participation  the availability of debt funding in sufficient quantities and at favorable rates to support continued growth  the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness  the size of the agricultural mortgage market  borrower preferences for fixed rate agricultural mortgage indebtedness  the willingness of lenders to sell agricultural mortgage loans into the farmer mac secondary market  the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage backed securities  competition in the origination or purchase of agricultural mortgage loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage backed and debt securities  or changes in farmer mac s status as a government sponsored enterprise 
the foregoing factors are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely impact farmer mac s business and its financial performance 
furthermore  new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor assess the impact of such factors on farmer mac s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied by the forward looking statements

overview during  farmer mac built upon the solid foundation laid in with significant improvement in its financial results and business volume 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net income increased from million in to million in prior to third quarter  net income included provisions for income taxes based on an effective tax rate significantly lower than farmer mac s statutory tax rate  due to the recognition of previously deferred tax benefits 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  the provision for taxes  and thereby net income  is adjusted to reflect an effective tax rate equal to farmer mac s statutory tax rate 
earnings per share were for classes a and b common stock for  compared to for on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
class c earnings per share were for  compared to for farmer mac s improved financial results were attributable to a increase in revenues  compared to a increase in operating expenses total expenses excluding the provision for loan losses 
growth in revenues was attributable to increased net interest income from on balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities and other investments and increased guarantee fees  partially offset by reduced gain on sale of ambs as a result of fewer capital market sales of ambs due to market volatility in the latter half of that volatility resulted in lower rates on treasury securities  but wider spreads on farmer mac debt securities and even wider spreads on ambs 
these conditions diminished the economic attractiveness of capital market sales of ambs  due to lower potential gains on sale  but facilitated farmer mac s retention of the ambs in its portfolio at favorable spreads 
the retention of ambs in farmer mac s portfolio will generate net interest income over the long term with a present value in excess of the foregone up front gain on issuance 
net interest income grew in due to growth in program assets farmer mac i and ii securities and loans held for securitization and non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investments 
the increase in program assets reflected continued growth in the farmer mac ii program and increased purchases of loans through the farmer mac i program that have not been securitized and sold into the capital markets  including loans backing ambs that have been issued and retained by farmer mac 
non program assets increased in accordance with farmer mac s debt issuance program begun in early to increase its market presence and investor recognition of its securities and  thereby  improve both spreads on its debt and mortgage backed securities and the mortgage rates available to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners 
farmer mac s principal objective for the proceeds of its debt issuances is their eventual investment in program assets 
during the phase in of that objective  the term of which is dependent upon growth in farmer mac s core guarantee business  farmer mac expects to continue to invest significantly in non program assets 
guarantee fee income grew in as outstanding farmer mac guaranteed securities increased by to billion 
growth in outstanding farmer mac guaranteed securities reflects an increase in farmer mac i loan purchases  which increased from million in to million in this growth in volume is attributable to increased participation by both traditional and non traditional lenders  as a result of farmer mac s business development efforts 
in particular  the involvement of non traditional lenders  such as mortgage bankers who can utilize their existing facilities and personnel to access the agricultural mortgage market at low marginal costs  has increased the number of outlets offering farmer mac loans  as well as resulted in new marketing initiatives to advertise the benefits and availability of farmer mac loans 
as farmer mac s volume has increased so has the demand for  and increase in the number of  new competitive products to meet the needs of borrowers and lenders  further broadening farmer mac s business base 
examples include a partial open prepayment loan and long term standby purchase commitment facility  both introduced in late the partial open prepayment loan offers borrowers greater flexibility by allowing them to prepay their mortgages without penalty after the third year 
the long term standby purchase commitment  which is a variation on a swap transaction  permits a lender to segregate a pool of loans in its portfolio and transfer the credit risk on those loans to farmer mac  in return for the payment to farmer mac of fees on the outstanding balance of the segregated loans approximating what would have been farmer mac s guarantee fee had the loans been exchanged with farmer mac in a swap transaction 
in late  farmer mac and a system institution committed to enter into a long term standby transaction covering million of loans  which closed in early farmer mac believes that this long term standby transaction  together with the closing in of two swap transactions totaling million with another system institution  effectively demonstrate how farmer mac can better serve traditional agricultural lenders that have large mortgage portfolios and seek more effective and efficient ways to free up capital to support additional business activity and manage their liquidity and credit risk 
notwithstanding the increase in outstanding farmer mac guaranteed securities and the adverse changes in the agricultural economy in  farmer mac did not experience any significant change in credit performance 
while delinquencies are expected to increase in due to both the growing number of loans held or securitized by farmer mac that are approaching their anticipated peak default years and the current stress in the agricultural economy  farmer mac believes overall credit quality remains strong 
furthermore  increased demand by high quality borrowers for mortgages on favorable credit terms  as a result of the stress in the agricultural economy  should provide farmer mac with new opportunities to serve agricultural lenders and borrowers  resulting in additional loan purchase volume 
as an institution  farmer mac has grown steadily stronger during the last three years 
throughout that period  farmer mac s growth has depended  and will continue to depend  upon ongoing increases in the volume of loans covered by its guarantee 
as the board and management continue to pursue the principal corporate objective of increasing guarantee volume without sacrificing quality  certain factors and conditions remain likely to constrain farmer mac s progress  particularly the organizational bias of many institutions that dominate agricultural lending today toward retaining loans in portfolio rather than selling them  notwithstanding the corporate finance and capital planning benefits they might realize through participation in farmer mac s programs  the ability of some lending institutions to subsidize their agricultural mortgage loan rates through price averaging with non mortgage loans  or by low return use of their equity  which reduce the relative competitiveness of farmer mac s loan rates  uncertainties surrounding the level of future participation in farmer mac s programs by non traditional lenders  which could influence the competitive responses of the more traditional lenders and contribute to farmer mac s volume  and downturns in the agricultural economy  as evidenced by the low commodity prices  reduced export demand and adverse weather conditions experienced in and continuing into  which could adversely affect the development of the farmer mac secondary market  particularly if they reduce farm income and decrease land values 
in addition  as an instrumentality of the united states created by congress and regulated by governmental agencies  farmer mac s future development is subject to political and regulatory considerations 
in  the gao conducted two reviews of farmer mac s activities  the first of which addressed the investment activities of farmer mac and other government sponsored enterprises and the second of which reviewed farmer mac s statutory mandate and its ability to fulfill that mandate 
farmer mac believes that its investment practices represent a prudent business strategy for a growing company  and that its growth in the three years since congress expanded its statutory authorities demonstrates the value of a government sponsored agricultural secondary market 
in addition  the fca is in the process of developing a risk based capital test to be applied to farmer mac following a public rulemaking process 
the details of this risk based capital standard  and its financial consequences to farmer mac  are not yet known 
these political and regulatory processes  which will continue to require the attention of farmer mac s board and management  may restrain future growth  to the extent that farmer mac s current activities or future initiatives are inhibited by regulatory or political actions 
having passed the milestone of billion in outstanding farmer mac guaranteed securities in  farmer mac has established an annuity stream of guarantee fee income that will strengthen its business for many years into the future 
each sequential year s growth compounds that annuity benefit 
as significant as farmer mac s outstanding guarantee volume is  that volume represents only a small percentage of the total outstanding agricultural mortgage indebtedness that farmer mac believes is eligible for its programs 
while continued growth in loan volume is expected in  farmer mac faces the challenges of establishing a new market where none previously existed 
acceptance of farmer mac s programs is increasing among lenders  reflecting the competitive rates  terms and products offered and the advantages we believe farmer mac s programs provide 
but for farmer mac to succeed in realizing its business development and profitability goals over the long term  agricultural mortgage lenders  whether traditional or non traditional  must value the benefits of selling loans to farmer mac or otherwise obtaining the benefits of the farmer mac guarantee and must be persuaded to modify their business practices accordingly 
a detailed discussion of farmer mac s financial results for the years ended december   and follows

net interest income totaled million in compared to million in the increase in net interest income was due to an increase in the average balance of interest earnings assets and a basis point increase in net interest yield 
the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of cash equivalents and investments as a result of farmer mac s expanded debt issuance program begun in early increases in farmer mac guaranteed securities and loans held for securitization also contributed to the increase 
for further information  see balance sheet review 
the increase in net interest yield was due to an increase in the balance of non interest bearing funding  which consists primarily of stockholders equity  as a result of the million stock issuance that occurred in late net interest income totaled million in the million increase from to was due largely to the same factors discussed above  as the average balance of interest earnings assets more than doubled in and net interest yield increased basis points 
the increase in net interest yield was attributable to the increase in the average balance of stockholders equity as a result of the stock issuance that occurred in late other income 
other income increased slightly from million in to million in  as an increase in guarantee fee income was largely offset by a decrease in gain on sale of ambs 
guarantee fee income  which is earned annually on the cumulative outstanding balance of guaranteed securities  including those issued in prior years  increased from million in to million in due to a corresponding increase in the outstanding balance of guaranteed securities 
while ambs issuances increased during compared to  gains on sale of ambs decreased due to the temporary changeover to a retained portfolio strategy in the latter half of see overview 
in  farmer mac recognized a million gain on the sale of million of ambs  compared to a million gain on the sale of million of ambs in miscellaneous income  the third component of other income  totaled thousand in  compared to thousand in for year end  miscellaneous income included the difference between the amount farmer mac had accrued for expenses in related to litigation and the actual amount incurred  which was lower as a result of the settlement of that litigation in january other income increased million in to million compared to total other income of million in the increase in other income from to was due to increases in both guarantee fee income and gain on sale of ambs 
guarantee fee income increased thousand during due to an increase in outstanding guarantees  while gain on sale of ambs increased million due to an increase in the amount of ambs sold to capital market investors 
other expenses 
other expenses  excluding the provision for loan losses  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in operating expenses were attributable to increased compensation and other costs related to expanded operations since the enactment in of the revised legislative authorities to farmer mac s statutory charter 
farmer mac s provision for losses totaled million in  compared to thousand in and thousand in the increases in the provision for losses were due to an increase in outstanding ambs for which farmer mac assumes of the credit risk see risk management credit risk management 
income tax benefit expense 
in and  farmer mac recognized million and million  respectively  of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
as a result  farmer mac reported tax expense of thousand in and a net tax benefit of thousand in the tax benefits recognized in and  which related primarily to net operating losses incurred in prior years  had not been recognized due to uncertainty regarding the level of future profitability 
as certainty regarding future profitability increased  however  farmer mac recognized the deferred tax benefits 
as of june   all previously unrecognized tax benefits had been recognized 
accordingly  farmer mac s effective tax rate in future periods will approximate its statutory tax rate of percent 
for further information regarding income taxes  see note to the financial statements 
extraordinary gain 
in  farmer mac recognized an extraordinary gain of thousand from the early extinguishment of million of debt 
there was no early extinguishment of debt in or business volume 
during  purchases of qualified loans under the farmer mac i program increased  from million in to million in purchase volume in includes million of loans acquired through swap transactions and million of loans acquired through farmer mac s cash window 
during  virtually all of farmer mac s loan purchases came through the cash window 
cash window transactions usually involve purchases of newly originated loans  while swap transactions typically represent acquisitions of seasoned loans 
in addition to the increase in purchase volume in  farmer mac also entered into a long term standby purchase commitment covering million of seasoned qualified loans  which was completed in january during  farmer mac issued million of ambs  of which million were sold to capital market investors  million were issued in exchange for qualified loans in swap transactions and million were retained by farmer mac 
during  farmer mac issued million of ambs  all of which were sold to capital market investors 
the decrease in ambs sold to capital market investors  and corresponding increase in retained ambs  was due to the temporary changeover to a retained portfolio strategy during the third quarter of see overview 
indicators of future guarantee volume  particularly cash window activity  include outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans and the total balance of loans in the farmer mac i pipeline 
farmer mac enters into mandatory delivery commitments to purchase loans 
if a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver the loans required thereunder within the specified time period  farmer mac requires the seller to pay a fee to extend or cancel the commitment 
at december   outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans totaled million  compared to million at december  the farmer mac i pipeline represents loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased 
not all loans in the pipeline are purchased  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller 
the farmer mac i pipeline totaled million at december   compared to million at december  balance sheet review assets 
at december   total assets were billion compared to billion at december  the increase in assets was due to increases in both program assets farmer mac guaranteed securities and loans held for securitization and non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investments 
non program assets increased from million at december  to billion at december  this increase was due to continued implementation of farmer mac s debt issuance program begun in early the change in program assets  which increased by million during  reflects continued growth in the farmer mac ii program and increased purchases of mortgages through the farmer mac i program  which have not yet been securitized and sold into the capital markets  including the million of ambs retained in farmer mac s portfolio during due to capital market conditions 
for further information regarding farmer mac i and ii securities held by farmer mac  see note to the financial statements 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased from billion at december  to billion at december  most of farmer mac s liabilities are due within one year since most of farmer mac s assets are short or long term floating rate investments 
notes payable due after one year totaled million at december   compared to million at december  long term debt at december  includes million of debt issued in conjunction with interest rate swaps  which convert the fixed rate interest cost to a floating rate see risk management 
as of december   no such interest rate swaps were outstanding as the swaps and related debt were called during the year 
during  million of long term debt was called 
capital 
at december   farmer mac s stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million from december  this increase was primarily due to net income earned during at december  and december   farmer mac s regulatory required minimum capital was million and million  compared with actual regulatory capital of million and million  respectively see liquidity and capital resources capital requirements 
off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities 
at december   outstanding off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities totaled million  compared to million at december  for further information regarding off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities  see risk management credit risk management 
risk management interest rate risk management 
interest rate risk is the risk that interest rate changes could materially affect the value  or future earnings  of farmer mac 
farmer mac is exposed to two primary sources of interest rate risk a farmer mac i and ii securities and other assets held for investment and b loans held for securitization 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to farmer mac i and ii securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities 
mortgage prepayments can cause fluctuations in the value of farmer mac to the extent that they change the cash flows of farmer mac s assets 
yield maintenance provisions associated with many of the loans underlying farmer mac i securities reduce  but do not eliminate  this risk 
yield maintenance provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment to farmer mac when they prepay their loans 
this payment is calculated such that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  they should generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid 
none of the loans underlying farmer mac ii securities have yield maintenance provisions 
loans without yield maintenance provisions represented of the total principal amount of all loans underlying farmer mac i and ii securities at december  there is less interest rate risk related to farmer mac s portfolio of non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investments because it consists entirely of non prepayable fixed rate investments or prepayable investments that reprice within one year 
however  farmer mac does invest in certain adjustable rate investments that limit or cap the amount the investment coupon rate can increase 
such capped investments totaled million at december  farmer mac s primary strategy to manage interest rate risk related to farmer mac i and ii securities and other assets held for investment is to fund them with liabilities that have similar durations or average cash flow patterns over time 
to achieve the desired liability duration  farmer mac uses a mix of short term discount notes and callable and non callable medium term notes see note to the financial statements 
by using a mix of liabilities that includes callable debt  the duration of the liabilities will tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the duration of the assets 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to capped adjustable rate investments by purchasing interest rate contracts that effectively uncap the investments see note to the financial statements 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans held for securitization  including loans committed to be  but not yet  purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase a qualified loan  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either a sells ambs backed by the loan or b issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio  although issuing debt to fund the loans as an investment does not fully mitigate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
as of december   the balance of loans committed or purchased and not yet sold or funded as retained investments totaled million 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans through the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap contracts and treasury futures contracts 
of the total balance of loans committed or purchased and not yet sold forward or funded as retained investments  million were hedged with interest rate swap contracts and million were hedged with treasury futures contracts 
the remaining portion consisted of adjustable rate loans that farmer mac does not hedge 
interest rate swap contracts reduce farmer mac s interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and ambs and debt spreads by converting the loan rate to a quarterly adjustable rate 
unlike interest rate swaps  treasury futures only mitigate farmer mac s exposure to changes in treasury rates  farmer mac manages its exposure to changes in ambs spreads and debt spreads by monitoring those spreads and by forward selling or funding loans as often as possible 
for further information regarding off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  see note to the financial statements 
farmer mac has established policies and implemented interest rate risk management procedures to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk 
management performs sensitivity analyses of farmer mac s fair value of equity fve and calculates the duration gap  as measured by the duration of equity  on an ongoing basis 
these risk measures are reviewed regularly by management s asset liability committee and the finance committee of the board of directors to ensure compliance with farmer mac s interest rate risk policy limits 
the simulation of fve is the process of generating multiple paths for future interest rates starting from a base yield curve and then discounting the estimated cash flows under those rate paths to arrive at the estimated fair value of farmer mac s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
farmer mac uses a commercially developed model to perform the fve analysis 
the analysis  which is based on farmer mac s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments  and does not assume any new business  measures the change in fve under seven interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate scenarios include a base case in which the base yield curve is equal to the current yield curve  and six parallel and instantaneous shocks to the base yield curve plus and minus  and basis points 
inherent in the fve sensitivity analysis presented is the assumption that interest rate changes occur as instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  such shifts are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
in addition  actual future market conditions may differ materially from those assumed in the analysis 
for example  actual loan prepayments and farmer mac ambs and debt spreads may differ significantly from those assumed in the analysis 
accordingly  the results of the fve sensitivity analysis should not be viewed as a projection of future results 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s fve sensitivity analysis at december  interest rate scenario percentage change in fve from base case bp bp bp base case bp bp bp farmer mac s duration of equity at december  was approximately years  or months 
at december   farmer mac was in compliance with the established policy limits for fve and duration gap interest rate risk 
credit risk management 
farmer mac primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on loans it holds  as well as on loans backing securities issued to third parties because of farmer mac s guarantee of the timely payment of principal  including any balloon payments  and interest on the securities 
loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac can be divided into three groups a pre act farmer mac i loans  b post act farmer mac i loans  and c farmer mac ii loans 
for pre act loans  farmer mac s credit risk exposure is mitigated by subordinated interests 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
at december   the subordinated interest of each outstanding security backed by pre act farmer mac i loans was equal to or greater than of the total outstanding balance 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac assumes of the credit risk on post act farmer mac i loans 
farmer mac mitigates the credit risk related to these loans through the application of its underwriting and appraisal standards and by requiring collateral in the form of the real estate see business farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards 
farmer mac s credit exposure on farmer mac ii loans is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states by virtue of the usda guarantee of the principal and interest on all guaranteed portions 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to pre act farmer mac i loans because of the subordinated interests  or to farmer mac ii loans because of the usda guarantee 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac is summarized in the table below 
included in the table is the pro forma effect of the million long term standby purchase commitment agreed to in december and closed in january see results of operations business volume 
farmer mac s credit exposure on a long term standby purchase commitment is the same as that of a post act farmer mac i loan 
december  actual pro forma actual in thousands farmer mac i loans post act    pre act    farmer mac ii loans    includes the january long term standby purchase commitment 
farmer mac continually assesses its credit risk exposure related to post act farmer mac i loans by monitoring agricultural economic conditions and evaluating the credit quality of those loans 
despite adverse trends in agricultural economic conditions in and continuing into  particularly low commodity prices  reduced export demand and weather related problems in certain areas of the country  farmer mac believes that the credit quality of the post act farmer mac i loans remains strong  based on farmer mac s credit underwriting  appraisal and diversification standards 
the following tables set forth the loan to value  geographic and commodity distributions of the post act farmer mac i loans  including the long term standby purchase commitment  as of december  and for information regarding loan to value  commodity and geographic distributions of all farmer mac i loans  see note to the financial statements 
december  actual pro forma actual by original loan to value ratio to to to to to to total by geographic regions mid north mid south northeast northwest southeast southwest total by commodity crops livestock permanent plantings part time farms total includes the january long term standby purchase commitment 
regions are defined in note to the financial statements 
farmer mac s policy is to limit its credit exposure in a particular geographic region or commodity to a percentage of the total principal amount of all loans outstanding  considering the credit quality of the loans in that particular geographic region or commodity group based on the borrower s loan to value  debt service coverage  equity to asset and working capital to current asset ratios 
for example  the higher concentration in the northwest region as a result of the long term standby purchase commitment is mitigated by the lower loan to value ratios associated with the loans in that transaction  which had a weighted average loan to value ratio when the transaction closed 
the effectiveness of farmer mac s underwriting  appraisal and diversification standards is reflected primarily through the level of defaulted loans and related credit losses 
at december   post act farmer mac i loans that were days or more past due referred to as non performing or impaired loans totaled million  or of the total principal amount of all post act loans 
there were no such delinquent loans as of december  the increase in the delinquency rate of the post act farmer mac i loans was due to the growing number of loans that are approaching their anticipated peak default years and adverse conditions affecting the agricultural economy 
farmer mac anticipates fluctuations in the delinquency rate from quarter to quarter  with higher numbers likely to be reported during the first and third quarters of each year due to the semiannual payment characteristics of most farmer mac loans  and with the average delinquency level increasing during due to the foregoing factors 
farmer mac maintains a reserve to cover credit losses incurred on post act loans 
at december   farmer mac s reserve for loan losses totaled million  compared to million at december  the reserve as a percentage of outstanding post act farmer mac i loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses on a quarterly basis and considers a number of factors  including historical charge off and recovery activity noting any particular trends in preceding periods  trends in delinquencies  bankruptcies and non performing loans  trends in loan volume and size of credit risks  current and anticipated economic conditions  the condition of agricultural segments and geographic areas experiencing or expected to experience particular economic adversities  particularly areas where farmer mac may have a geographic or commodity concentration  the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the guaranteed portfolio  the results of its quality control reviews  and its underwriting standards 
although some credit losses are expected to be incurred during on the existing post act farmer mac i delinquencies  farmer mac expects the losses to be well within current reserve levels 
to a lesser extent  farmer mac is also exposed to institutional credit risk related to issuers of agvantage bonds and other investments held by farmer mac  seller and servicers  and interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage bonds are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from to of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the agvantage issuers 
the credit risk inherent in the investment portfolio is mitigated by farmer mac s policy of investing in highly rated instruments and by establishing concentration limits  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty 
farmer mac s policy limits the dollar amount of investments with one counterparty  excluding the other government sponsored enterprises gses  to the lesser of of farmer mac s stockholders equity or million  and requires the counterparty to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
as of december   farmer mac had investments outstanding with non gse counterparties  each of which exceeded of farmer mac s stockholders equity  but no one of which exceeded of its stockholders equity 
the short term nature of farmer mac s investment portfolio also limits its credit risk 
at december   of farmer mac s investment portfolio consisted primarily of short term highly liquid investments  with the remainder primarily consisting of longer term  variable rate gse and agency mortgage backed securities 
farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring such institutions to meet certain standards and by monitoring their financial condition and servicing performance 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
farmer mac s business programs present funding needs that are driven by the purchase of qualified loans  payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities and the maturities of debt 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are issuances of debt obligations  principal and interest payments on mortgages underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and net operating cash flows 
because of farmer mac s regular participation in the capital markets and its status as a government sponsored enterprise  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
farmer mac also maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents  comprised of commercial paper and other short term investments  to draw upon as necessary 
at december  and  farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
capital requirements 
the act  as amended by the act  establishes three capital standards for farmer mac minimum  critical and risk based 
the minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations  with the critical capital requirement equal to one half of the minimum capital amount 
higher minimum and critical capital requirements were phased in over a transition period  which ended on january   when the highest level of minimum capital became applicable 
the act does not specify the required level of risk based capital 
it directs the fca to establish a risk based capital test for farmer mac  using stress test parameters set forth therein  and provides that the related public rulemaking process shall commence no sooner than february for a discussion of risk based capital  including the potential impact of future risk based capital requirements on farmer mac  see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards risk based capital 
certain enforcement powers are given to the fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards 
see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards enforcement levels 
as of december  and  farmer mac was classified as within level i the highest compliance level 
the following table sets forth farmer mac s minimum capital requirement as of december  based on the then current requirements and assuming the fully phased in requirements were in effect current requirement fully phased in requirement capital capital amount ration required amount ratio required designated assets farmer mac i and ii securities     loans held for securitization     other on balance sheet assets     outstanding balance of guaranteed mortgage securities held by others     other off balance sheet obligations   minimum capital level   actual core capital   capital surplus   in the opinion of management  farmer mac has sufficient liquidity and capital for the next twelve months 
other matters year the year problem relates to the inability of some computer programs to process date sensitive information due to the use of two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  these computer programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the year date change potentially could affect farmer mac s internal information technology it and non it systems  as well as systems utilized by its external vendors 
farmer mac s internal it systems  which are pc software based  are used to perform critical business processes including purchases of qualified loans  sales of ambs  issuances of debt securities  payments to debt security and ambs investors  and financial reporting to investors and stockholders 
certain vendors also perform critical business processes by servicing the loans held or securitized by farmer mac and administering the guaranteed securities issued by farmer mac 
failure of it and or vendor systems to handle the year date change could result in farmer mac being unable to perform critical business processes and expose farmer mac to significant business risk
