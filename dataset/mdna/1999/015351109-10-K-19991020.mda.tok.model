item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in important factors regarding forward looking statements attached hereto as exhibit overview since our inception in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research and product development 
in  we began to focus more of our resources to clinical testing and trials 
we are conducting clinical trials of our two lead product candidates  g sc for the treatment of inflammation caused by cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and g for the chronic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and membranous nephritis 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  preclinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development and scale up  and developing a sales and marketing force 
results of operations fiscal years ended july   and we earned contract research revenues of million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  the increase in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to a non refundable license fee of million which we received from procter gamble in february in exchange for rights to sell  market and distribute g sc 
additionally  during fiscal year ended july   we received million in contract revenues from procter gamble under our collaborative research and development agreement 
the increase in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to revenues of million which we received from united states surgical corporation in exchange for licensing rights and other xenotransplantation manufacturing assets 
the revenues in the fiscal year ended july  consisted principally of contract revenues of million from us surgical and million from genetic therapy  inc  a subsidiary of novartis 
during the fiscal year ended july   we incurred expenses of million  on research and development activities 
in the fiscal year ended july   we incurred expenses of million  and in the fiscal year ended july  we incurred expenses of million in research and development activities 
our increase in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily attributable to an expansion of the clinical trials of our lead c inhibitor product candidates and process manufacturing development for our c inhibitor product candidates 
in the fiscal year ended july   research and development expenses increased million as compared to the fiscal year ended july  due principally to expanded preclinical development of our research programs and process development for our c inhibitor and apogen product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  the increase in general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended july  was primarily related to higher recruiting expenses  legal expenses related to business development and patent costs in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended july  was primarily related to lower legal and patent costs in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  other income expense  net  representing primarily net investment income  was million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in the fiscal year ended july  was due to lower cash balances available for investment as compared to the fiscal year ended july  the increase in the fiscal year ended july  was due to higher cash balances available for investment as compared to the fiscal year ended july  as a result of the above factors  we had incurred net losses of million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  liquidity and capital resources since our inception in january  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures principally through private placements of our common and preferred stock  an initial public offering of our common stock  equipment and leasehold improvements financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
in the fiscal year ended july   we financed the purchase of laboratory and process development equipment and leasehold improvements through a million secured term loan from a commercial bank 
principal payments of  are payable quarterly through august as of july   the outstanding balance on this term loan was  principal is due with interest at a variable rate which is reset quarterly 
as of july   the annualized interest rate was 
the term loan agreement requires us to maintain a restricted cash balance equal to of the outstanding loan balance plus accrued interest in an interest earning money market account as security for the note 
in february  we acquired the manufacturing assets  principally land  buildings and laboratory equipment  for the xenotransplantation program developed by us surgical 
we financed the purchase of the manufacturing assets through a million term note payable to us surgical 
interest is per annum and is payable quarterly 
the principal balance under the note is due in may security for this term note is the manufacturing assets that we purchased 
as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million 
at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million of cash we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
as of july   we have invested million in property and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense will increase significantly for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
we lease our administrative office and research and development facilities under three operating leases which expired in december  june and march we are currently continuing the leases on a month to month basis while participating in ongoing discussions for new leases of our current facilities 
procter gamble has agreed to fund all clinical testing of our c inhibitor  g sc  initially for use in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery  myocardial infarction and angioplasty 
the procter gamble collaboration does not involve any of our other product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing available capital resources and interest earned on available cash and marketable securities should be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next months 
while we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including progress of our research and development programs  progress and results of clinical trials  time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents and any necessary licenses  our ability to establish development and commercialization relationships  and costs of manufacturing scale up 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  for research  preclinical studies and clinical testing  manufacturing process development  additional capital expenditures related to personnel  and facilities expansion  and manufacturing requirements 
in addition to funds we may receive from our collaboration with procter gamble  we will need to raise or generate substantial additional funding in order to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in addition  if and when we achieve contractual milestones related to product development and product license applications and approvals  additional payments would be required if we elect to continue and maintain our licenses with our licensors  aggregating up to a maximum of million 
our additional financing may include public or private debt or equity offerings  bank loans and or collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners 
for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire through and million of tax credit carryforwards which expire commencing in fiscal provisions of the tax reform act of may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including a provision relating to cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we cannot assure you that our ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in future years will not be limited as a result of a change in ownership 
year the year issue  or yk  refers to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips or software that use dates where the date has been stored as just two digits 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism incorporating date sensitive software which uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  perform laboratory analyses  or engage in similar business activities 
we are a biotechnology company and our proposed product candidates are not software or computer based 
therefore  our proposed products are not directly impacted by the yk problem 
our exposure to potential risks from this problem involves computer and information technology systems  and other systems which include embedded technology using date sensitive programs such as for heating  ventilation  air conditioning  or hvac  scientific instrumentation  and laboratory facilities 
our internal information systems consist of off the shelf accounting and e mail systems  off the shelf application programs such as spreadsheet  word processing  graphics  database management  and presentation software  and certain instrumentation data acquisition software 
non informational technology systems consist of hvac and telecommunications 
we have taken actions to minimize the impact of the yk problem on our systems and operations  excluding a systemic failure outside our control  such as a prolonged loss of electrical or telephone service 
we have inventoried and reviewed our systems  scientific instrumentation  and laboratory facilities  including querying third parties that have a material relationship with us  to ascertain yk compliance 
our review included examining information from our equipment and software vendors  literature supplied with software  and test evaluations of our systems 
based upon our work and knowledge to date  which included updating various software programs  we believe that the risk is minimal that our internal systems  scientific instrumentation  and laboratory facilities will be materially impacted by yk non compliance disruptions 
most of our existing systems  scientific instrumentation  and laboratory facilities are yk compliant or are expected to be yk compliant by december  vendors for our off the shelf applications  including our accounting and e mail systems  have informed us that their products are yk compliant 
to date  our review has not disclosed otherwise 
we have no reason to believe that these applications are not yk compliant 
if these applications are not yk compliant  we expect  but cannot be certain  that the vendors will make appropriate upgrades available to all of their customers at no cost or at minimal cost 
we believe that if it were necessary to replace our off the shelf software applications  such software could be replaced at reasonable costs 
for example  the approximate replacement cost of our e mail system would be  we have identified a yk problem in our hvac system 
we have engaged an outside contractor to correct the yk problem 
we believe that the cost of correcting this problem will be approximately  and expect the problem to be corrected in december during a regularly scheduled maintenance cycle 
as a result of our personnel expansion  we upgraded our telecommunication system  whether or not it had a yk problem 
the cost of this upgrade  which is yk compliant  was approximately  and also provided for future enhancements 
with regard to third party risks  we continue to assess yk risks 
third parties include research suppliers and partners  manufacturers  research organizations and clinical study administrators 
our vendors and suppliers have indicated that they will make every effort to be yk compliant before december   but that no guarantees can be given 
we have  for example  been informed by our outside payroll processor that their payroll system is yk compliant 
we expect third parties to honor their contractual obligations 
the majority of our material third party contracts relate to sites for clinical trials of our product candidates  research and development  and our collaboration with procter gamble 
we believe that there is no readily available replacement for our collaboration agreement with procter gamble 
we further believe that it would be difficult  time consuming  and costly to find alternative clinical sites and research arrangements 
we will continue to work with third parties to identify and resolve any problems with yk compliance 
in a worst case scenario  we could experience delays in receiving research and development and manufacturing supplies as well as managing and accessing data on patients enrolled in clinical studies 
these delays could slow clinical development and research and development programs  or impact our ability to effectively manage and monitor these programs 
these delays could also have an adverse impact on our stock price 
based on the information and assessments to date  no contingency plans have been developed 
any yk compliance problems which arise could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  or cash flow 
we will continue to identify all yk problems that could materially adversely affect our business operations 
however  it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all yk problems affecting us or third parties which have a material relationship with us  have been identified 
it is not possible to insure economically against all conceivable risks 
to date  we have incurred less than  in costs associated with our yk program 
this excludes the costs of older computer and scientific instrumentation that have been replaced in the ordinary course as such systems are upgraded or expanded 
we believe that the costs associated with repairs or upgrades and verification of our internal systems to become yk compliant will not be more than  we believe that all such repairs or upgrades and verification will be complete in december with the repair and upgrade to our hvac system discussed above 
we expect to fund all these expenses from working capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income on the company s marketable securities is carried in other income expense 
the company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company s marketable securities are held for purposes other than trading 
the marketable securities as of july   had maturities of less than two years 
the weighted average interest rate on marketable securities at july  was 
the fair value of marketable securities held at july  was million
