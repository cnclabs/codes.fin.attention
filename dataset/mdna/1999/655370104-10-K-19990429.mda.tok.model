seasonality the company s operations are highly seasonal and approximately of its revenues fall within the company s fourth quarter which coincides with the christmas selling season 
new stores are expected to be opened throughout the year  but generally before the christmas selling season  which will make the company s fourth quarter revenues an even greater percentage of the total year s revenues 
operations during the first three quarters are not expected to be profitable for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company s results of operations has not been significant 
the company attempts to pass on increased costs by increasing product prices over time 
year compliance the company has completed its review of year yk issues and does not believe that the business impact or cost of these issues is material 
the following areas have been reviewed corporate information systems all corporate information systems  both those developed by the company and critical systems developed by third parties  have been developed in an environment and programming language which are not affected by the year problem  and no software changes are needed 
in store systems all in store and point of sale pos software was developed by an outside software firm which has provided written assurance of the systems year compliance 
the company has tested the systems yk compliance during the first quarter of calendar and found the systems to be yk compliant 
personal computers some personal computers used to run the company s in store pos systems are not year compliant 
bios upgrades are available for these computers and are being obtained at little or no cost 
embedded systems none of the company s critical operations are dependent on embedded systems 
year compliance of telephone and alarm systems  which may contain embedded date sensitive circuits  will be verified with their respective vendors by the end of the first half of calendar risk there can be no assurance that the company s systems will be timely converted or that the failure of such systems to be year compliant will not have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
management believes that the risks associated with the year problem are minimal 
the greatest risk to the business is the possibility of an interruption in service from a vendor who is not properly prepared 
any impact to the business in this worst case scenario would be minimized by the likelihood that it will occur during the traditionally slower first quarter
