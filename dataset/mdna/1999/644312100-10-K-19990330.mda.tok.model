overview we began operations in january to develop  market and support enterprise software for application integration 
in and  our company was in the development stage and was principally focused on product development and assembling its management team and infrastructure 
software license revenues were not significant until the commercial release of our neonet software in january since such time  a substantial portion of our revenues have been attributable to licenses of neonet and related services 
in november  we commenced shipment to customers of release of neonet  which provided additional capabilities for effective enterprise wide application integration 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in may and december  we completed follow on offerings and issued  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  and received net proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
in september  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of menhir  a developer and marketer of enterprise client information systems  for million in cash  plus fees and expenses 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of msb  a developer and marketer of trading floor information systems 
the aggregate consideration paid was million  of which million was paid in cash and approximately million was paid through the issuance of  unregistered shares of our common stock 
in september  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cai  a developer and marketer of enterprise application software and services 
the aggregate consideration was paid as follows approximately million in cash  million in a short term note payable to cai shareholders and million through the issuance of  unregistered shares of our common stock 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations for fiscal years ended december   and revenues our revenues increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting an increase in software license revenues as we sold to a greater number of customers and expanded internationally 
revenues increased from million in to million  resulting from increased direct channel revenue  increased professional services revenue and the expansion of our product lines through both internal development and acquisitions 
software license revenues grew from million in to million  or of total revenue  in and to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in software license revenues reflected an increase in market awareness and acceptance of our products  expansion of international sales resources  the continued growth of an installed base of accounts to serve as references for new customers  repeat business by existing customers  and expanded functionality of the neonet suite of products 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with ibm for the joint development of a product designed to integrate ibm s mq series product with certain of our products 
under the terms of the agreement  both neon and ibm began selling the resulting mqintegrator product in may our royalties from sales of mqintegrator by ibm were approximately million  or of total software license revenues in total license revenue for direct sales of mqintegrator were approximately million  or of total software license revenue in we expect that future software license revenues will include the neonet suite of products  including the mqintegrator product  format templates  and new products internally developed and acquired 
services and maintenance revenues grew from million  or of total revenues  in to million  or of total revenues  in  to million  or of total revenues  in services and maintenance revenues grew in compared to  reflecting service engagements associated with the growing sales of the neonet product 
services and maintenance revenues grew million  or in  compared to  due to increased services and maintenance revenue associated with recent acquisitions  growing maintenance revenue streams of the neonet suite of products  and increased emphasis on sales of our implementation and development services 
in and  our top ten customers accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  our largest customer accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
to date  a significant portion of our revenues have been derived from sales to large banks and financial institutions 
for the years ended december  and  sales to banks and financial institutions accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of costs of software licenses and costs of services and maintenance 
as a percentage of total revenues  total cost of revenues declined from in  to in  to in the decline reflects the increasing mix of higher margin software license sales  net of an increase in royalty expense associated with the sale of the jointly developed mq integrator product by our sales force 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of royalty payments 
we had an agreement to pay royalties to merrill lynch on neonet license revenue until such royalties reached a cumulative total of million 
we accrued royalties at of neonet license fees in and of neonet license fees in  reflecting our revised agreement with merrill lynch co 
during as a result  cost of software licenses was approximately of software license revenue in in the fourth quarter of  we met the cumulative million royalty requirement  and cost of software licenses in fell to approximately of software license revenue 
in may of  with the roll out of the jointly developed mqintegrator product  we began paying royalties to ibm for sales of mqintegrator made by our direct sales force 
in  a significant portion of cost of software licenses were attributable to this royalty obligation 
in  our royalty obligation to ibm is expected to increase 
in august of  we began accruing royalties to jp morgan on license revenue collected for the sales of business event manager 
our obligation under this arrangement continues until we have paid cumulative royalties of  cost of services and maintenance consists primarily of personnel  facility  and systems costs incurred in providing professional service consulting  training  and customer support services 
as a percent of services and maintenance revenue  cost of services and maintenance was  and in  and  respectively 
the higher percentage cost in reflected the use  at higher cost  of subcontract labor on certain engagements 
we may continue to use subcontractors for the delivery of professional services from time to time 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  commissions  travel  and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of total revenues  respectively  in  and these increases were due primarily to our expansion of overall sales and marketing resources and infrastructure  including international expansion in the increase in absolute dollars from to of million  or  is due primarily to the increased sales commission rate for sales professionals who have achieved and surpassed their individual annual sales quotas for in addition  we continued to expand the sales team responsible for supporting indirect channel sales 
we expect to continue to expand the direct sales force and professional marketing staff  further increase our international presence  and continue to develop our indirect sales channels and increase promotional activity 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to grow in absolute dollars 
research and development research and development expenses include amounts associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities 
the research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salary and benefits  consultant costs  and associated equipment and software costs 
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
no software development costs have been capitalized to date in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million  representing  and of total revenues  respectively  in  and the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to hiring additional technical personnel engaged in software development activities 
we currently anticipate that research and development expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to commit substantial resources to new product development 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  outside professional fees  and software and equipment costs associated with the finance  legal  human resources  and administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of total revenues  respectively  in  and general and administrative expenses grew in absolute dollars as we added personnel to all administrative areas 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars from expected increases in personnel  implementation of additional management information systems associated with our business growth  and continuation of our international expansion 
charge for acquired in process research and development amortization of intangibles based on independent appraisals of the net assets acquired  million  million and million were allocated to in process research and development projects and were charged to operations in connection with the acquisition of menhir in september  msb in june and cai in september  respectively 
also in connection with these acquisitions  we allocated approximately million to marketable software products acquired which is being amortized over periods of three to five years  and approximately million to goodwill which is being amortized over periods of seven to ten years 
amortization expense of approximately  and million was recorded in and  respectively 
see in process research and development costs below 
other income expense  net we recorded net other income of million in this compares to net other income of  in and  in the increase in net other income in and resulted primarily from the interest earned on cash invested from the proceeds of our public offering in june and our follow on offerings in may and december we anticipate that interest income will decline in future periods as cash balances may be used to fund potential future acquisitions and our ongoing operations 
income tax benefit we reported no income tax expense in and our deferred tax assets at december  of million were offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount 
as of december   deferred tax assets of approximately million were also fully offset by a valuation allowance of an equivalent amount 
during  our deferred tax assets increased by about million to approximately million  principally for intangibles acquired from cai that were expensed  but which must be amortized for tax purposes over years  and additions to our tax credit carryovers 
we also realized reduced us taxes of approximately million for deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
as required  the tax benefit from the options was added to additional paid in capital and excluded from net income 
without the stock option deductions  we would have fully used our carryovers and paid us federal taxes in consequently  we concluded that it is likely that we will realize at least million of our deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance was adjusted to million 
at december   our balance sheet reflects net deferred tax assets of approximately million  equal to the deferred benefit recognized as part of the provision for income taxes 
the deferred benefit is offset by a current provision of million  consisting of approximately  of estimated foreign and state taxes currently payable and a million charge to transfer to additional paid in capital the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised 
thus we reported an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  net loss we reported a net loss of million  or 
per share for the year ended december  the loss includes acquisition related charges of million for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangibles 
excluding these charges and the related estimated tax benefit of approximately million  we generated net income of approximately million  or 
per share based on  diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
our net loss for was million  or 
per share 
exclusive of acquisition related charges of million for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangibles  our net loss was  or 
per share 
the reduced net loss in  as compared to when we lost million per share resulted from significant growth in revenues  particularly from software licenses  as compared with increases in costs and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we had million in cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments as of december  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of notes payable to banks at december  was zero compared to  at december  and million at december  we maintain a line of credit for borrowings of up to million  which can be used for working capital requirements on an as needed basis 
no amount was outstanding under this arrangement at december  or cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in operating cash flows were significantly improved each year by the increased profit from the growth of our business offset by a growth in accounts receivable 
we expect this trend to continue as a function of expected increases in total revenues 
cash used in investing activities was million  including million for net purchases of short term and long term investments in marketable investment securities  million for the purchases of msb and cai  and million for purchases of property and equipment 
this compares to cash used in investing activities of million in  including million for investments in marketable investment securities net of related proceeds  million for the purchase of menhir  and million for property and equipment 
cash provided from financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in in  the company received million in net proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and short term investments in marketable investment securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional sources of funds to continue to grow and support our business 
there can be no assurance that such capital  if needed  will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to us 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries located in london  england and sydney  australia 
sales and expenses from these operations are typically denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in foreign exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
we do not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows and  therefore  have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of foreign exchange rates relative to the united states dollar 
year compliance the year computer problem  commonly referred to as the yk bug  creates a risk for our company and therefore we make the following year readiness disclosure 
an adverse impact on our operations could occur if computer systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to our company s risk exists in the following areas systems used by our company to run its business  systems used by our suppliers  potential warranty and other claims from our customers  and the potential reduced spending by other companies on our software products due to significant information systems spending to remediate year problems 
our company is a relatively new corporation and  therefore  does not expect to encounter many year computer problems associated with its internal systems  equipment  or facilities 
as internal systems and equipment have been implemented  and as we have expanded into new facilities  in the normal course of our company s growth or through acquisition eg  cai  we have attempted to obtain assurances of year readiness from appropriate sources 
we will continue to obtain such assurances for future internal systems  equipment  and facilities 
in addition  we will continue to monitor  including performing additional testing  as appropriate  the year readiness status of previous obtained equipment  internal systems  and facilities 
noncompliant systems  equipment  or facilities are expected to be replaced or upgraded in a timely manner prior to december  we have not identified alternative remediation strategies if replacement or upgrade is not feasible  but will continue to reevaluate the need for alternative remediation strategies and contingency plans as warranted by further risk analysis 
for internal year noncompliance issues identified to date and expected throughout  the cost of upgrade or replacement is not expected to be material to our operating results 
however  if significant new noncompliance issues are subsequently identified  and replacement or upgrade is delayed beyond december   operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we have limited material relationships with suppliers whose inability to provide products or services would have a material adverse impact on operating results 
suppliers where such material relationships do exist appear to be limited to those utilities eg phone service  public service whose inability to provide service could materially affect all business entities 
we have and will continue to monitor their year efforts and will develop contingency plans as appropriate 
our company  based on certain products not including date fields  date field testing of other products or yk certification of cai acquired products  believes the majority of our current products are year compliant and has provided year warranties to many of our customers 
in fact  we believe that some customers may be purchasing certain of our products as an interim solution to their year needs until their current suppliers reach compliance 
however  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving third party products  increased warranty and other claims may be seen as a result of the transition to year litigation in general may also increase regarding year compliance issues 
therefore  the impact of customer claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
finally  year compliance issues are becoming issues of focus for almost all businesses 
companies whose computer systems and applications may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications may reallocate capital expenditures to fix year problems of existing systems  or reevaluate their current system needs 
if customers defer purchases of our software because of reallocation  or move to other systems or suppliers due to reevaluation  this too could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
in order to evaluate the above risks  implement any necessary remediations in the future  and provide risk reevaluations and continued appropriate monitoring activities  we have designated appropriate individuals within the organization responsible for year issues 
we will continue to assess the need for additional year readiness personnel as appropriate 
in process research and development costs during fiscal year  we acquired century analysis  inc cai  and msb consultants msb 
acquired in process research and development ipr d costs expensed at the date of these acquisitions during were million and million  respectively 
cai acquired september century analysis  incorporated cai was a privately held software manufacturer that provides solutions for productivity  connectivity  and information management to middle and large sized enterprises 
cai s products deliver application to application integration  which allows the easy exchange of data between applications and ensures high quality enterprise data 
the non invasive nature of cai products is key to its implementation since it allows various application integration efforts to move forward without having to modify any of the applications involved 
at the date of acquisition  cai s research and development r d efforts were focused on developing new products and services that would address the rapidly expanding market opportunities emerging as a result of the internet s increasing presence in business organizations 
specifically  cai was working on the next generation impact tdm product designed for the mainframe  component related products  and other enterprise technology 
these projects are particularly complex due to the component based integrated nature of cai s products and technology 
the acquired in process research and development was valued at million based on an analysis of forecasted income and million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill  developed technology and acquired workforce 
as of the date of acquisition  cai had invested million in the ipr d identified above 
development of the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products and services required efforts principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  coding  prototyping  scalability verification  and testing activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies would meet their design specifications  including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
we estimated that an additional million would be required over the next to months following the acquisition to develop the products to commercial viability 
we have continued to invest additional r d dollars in the acquired ipr d projects 
through december   we had expended approximately man months on the acquired projects in total 
currently  we are contemplating various strategies with respect to the continued development of the ipr d projects 
with respect to certain projects  we are determining whether we will develop products as stand alone products  or alternatively whether the technology will be integrated into portions of our existing products 
significant achievements had been accomplished as of the valuation date on the ipr d projects such as the development of frameworks for design and coding  construction of the various codes and surrounding architectures 
at december   we project the remaining costs required to complete the next generation impact tdm project will be approximately million 
we believe that the work performed as of the acquisition date had encompassed many of the critical elements necessary to complete this project  particularly due to the importance associated with the underlying design and architecture 
technological feasibility had not been reached by the end of the next generation impact tdm project has been incorporated into our global r d strategy  and the continued development and remaining costs for completion are currently under evaluation 
we envision that during the first half of  we will know if this next generation product will be released as a stand alone product  or that the development undertaken will be incorporated as part of a common product architecture 
we spent approximately  through the end of on further design and architecture efforts 
cai had expended a total of approximately million on component related projects prior to the closing of the acquisition 
for these projects to reach technological feasibility  additional efforts were projected to cost approximately  we have spent approximately  through december  on component related projects  including the evaluation of incorporating component technology within a set of integrated neon products 
technology from component related projects was incorporated into a neon product that has a projected release date during the second quarter of cai had expended approximately million on other enterprise technology solutions as of september for these projects to reach technological feasibility it was projected that additional efforts would need to be accomplished in a timely manner and would cost approximately million 
we spent approximately  on these projects  with xml technology advancing to the testing stage on several modules  and the corba technology being brought into a stand alone adapter product by year end msb acquired june msb supplies software to provide greater flexibility  inter operability  and enhanced functionality for the financial industry s use of financial data  as transmitted from various providers such as reuters and telerate 
at the date of acquisition  msb s r d efforts were focused on developing a new generation of products and services that would address the rapidly expanding market opportunities emerging as a result of the internet s increasing presence in business organizations 
specifically  msb was working on the price server with new capabilities  arte designed for a windows nt environment  and quantum leap 
these projects are particularly complex due to the modular nature of msb s products and technology 
the acquired in process research and development was valued at approximately million based on an analysis of forecasted income 
as of the date of acquisition  msb had invested million in the ipr d identified above 
development of the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products and services required efforts principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  coding  prototyping  scalability verification  and testing activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies would meet their design specifications  including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
we estimated that an additional  would be required over the next to months following the acquisition to develop the products to commercial viability 
we have continued to invest additional r d dollars in the acquired ipr d projects 
we expect to continue development on all of these projects through their completion 
currently  the timeline and expectations for completion of these projects do not differ materially from what was anticipated at the time of the purchase 
significant development tasks for the price server product that remain include the implementation of web and java technology  coding additional modules and internal tests  system testing and documentation 
we believe that the work performed as of the acquisition date had encompassed many of the critical elements needed to complete this project 
we estimated that approximately million in development costs had been incurred as of the acquisition date and approximately  would be required to complete the remaining development tasks 
we spent approximately  through december  the pricing module for banking applications is expected to be generally available during the first half of arte is currently being tested  but additional steps required to complete the products include i additional development for web browser  java support  and e commerce functions  ii stress testing  and iii testing at customer sites 
in order to achieve these milestones  we estimated that msb had spent approximately million on this project as of june remaining r d expenditures were estimated to be approximately  we spent approximately  through december arte s functionality will be incorporated into a neon product introduction in early  and further enhanced during the remainder of quantum leap is a middleware based product that provides a framework for sending information from legacy financial systems to the client 
the first set of product suites will be for transferring market data to client platforms  with emphasis on thin clients 
additional functionality will be added allowing msb to serve new market sectors including e commerce  retail and others during the years through quantum leap was designed conceptually and a number of detailed specifications had been completed at the time of purchase 
it was estimated that it would require approximately four full time developers to complete this project  that  had been incurred as of the acquisition date  and that approximately  would be required to complete the product 
we spent approximately  through december and released the first version in the fourth quarter of evaluation of completion efforts to ensure a proper reflection of the value of the r d achievements as of the acquisition date  the overall forecasts associated with the r d projects reflected only the contribution of what had been completed as of the acquisition dates 
the relative contribution made to each major r d effort was assessed and the risks associated with the projects completion were reflected in the corresponding discount rates 
to evaluate these results  an additional analysis was developed that explicitly excluded the efforts to be completed on the development efforts underway  but reflected the accomplishments made as of the valuation date towards the ultimate completion of the projects 
the relative contribution made on the r d efforts was estimated based on a variety of factors  including absolute development costs incurred to date  relative time spent on the projects  and a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed versus the tasks required to complete the efforts and the associated risks 
milestones for the in process projects were also examined as of the acquisition date 
for each project  our engineers evaluated the critical milestones 
this included comprehensive analysis of each acquired companies r d to clarify the technological hurdles that the development team had overcome at the time of the acquisition as well as the hurdles that the engineers faced going forward to complete the remaining development efforts 
from this analysis  the overall significance of tasks completed versus tasks remaining was assessed 
based on the technical achievements completed as of the respective purchase dates  milestone percentages were determined to be approximately   and for cai s next generation impact  component related  and other enterprise technology r d  respectively 
for msb  the milestone percentages were approximately for price server  for arte  and for quantum leap 
valuation methodology the valuations of the respective acquired ipr d included  but were not limited to  an analysis of the market for cai and msb products  the completion costs for the projects  the expected cash flows attributable to the in process research and development projects  and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections were derived from investment banking reports  independent analyst reports  neon  cai  and msb company records  and discussions with the management of both companies 
primary assumptions such as revenue growth and profitability were compared to indications of similar companies as well as to indications from industry analyst reports  to determine the extent to which these assumptions were supportable 
we did not assume in our valuation any material change in our profit margins as a result of the acquisition and did not assume any material increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition 
we did not anticipate any expense reductions or other synergies 
the basis of the acquisition was an attempt to enhance our competitive position by offering a broader product line  including applications and functionality based upon the middleware software technology 
we did not break down revenues attributable specifically to cai and msb derived products during  but plan to begin doing so in as products are offered both as a suite and as individual applications  neon license fees are not necessarily application specific 
however  we believe that overall revenues generated to date concur with the assumptions used in the valuation analysis 
within the msb product line  revenue from quantum leap was slightly under forecast due to a december shipping date against a forecasted october  but revenue from other msb products was higher than plan 
however  neon s sales channel efforts on marketing the quantum leap product are further along than planned  so we still concur with the estimates used in the valuation 
there was no revenue forecasted or realized for cai products under development during because we do not currently account for expenses by product  it is not possible to determine the precise actual expenses associated with the technology acquired from cai and msb 
however  we currently believe that expenses associated with completing the purchased in process research and development and integrating the technology with our existing products are consistent with the estimates used in the valuation 
in addition  completion dates for the development projects discussed above remain consistent with projections used at the time of the acquisition as well as are consistent with the numbers presented in this analysis 
research and development spending with respect to these offerings is expected to continue at a rate that is consistent with our overall research and development spending 
we do not believe that the acquisition resulted in any material changes in our profit margins or in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were consistent with the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects 
discount rates applied to projected cash flows from products under development were for cai and to for msb 
these discount rates were consistent with the acquired companies various stages of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty at the time of the acquisition surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the inherent uncertainties of the technological advances that were indeterminable at the time of the acquisition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of our company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the area of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar  which risk is directly related to our normal operating activities 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
