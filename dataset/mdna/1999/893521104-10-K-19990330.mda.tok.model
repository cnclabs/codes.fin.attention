item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial statements the following discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements of transatlantic holdings  inc and its subsidiaries trh as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december   which are presented elsewhere herein 
during  american international group  inc aig  and collectively  with its subsidiaries  the aig group increased its beneficial ownership of transatlantic holdings  inc the company outstanding common stock to as of year end 
financial data discussed below have been affected by certain transactions between trh and the aig group 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquisition of trans re zurich in the third quarter of  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  transatlantic reinsurance company trc  acquired all of the outstanding shares of trans re zurich trz  formerly known as guardian ruckversicherungs gesellschaft guardian re  an international reinsurance company based in zurich  switzerland  for approximately million in cash 
assets of trz totaled million at the date of acquisition 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  trz s results for the second half of and thereafter are included in the consolidated results of the company 
this acquisition has not had a material effect on financial position or net income 
operational review trh derives its revenue from two principal sources premiums from reinsurance assumed net of reinsurance ceded ie  net premiums earned and income from investments 
gross premiums assumed and reinsurance ceded are initially deferred and then are credited or charged to income  respectively  over the terms of the underlying contracts or certificates in force 
the deferred amounts constitute the unearned premium reserve or prepaid reinsurance premium and are generally ratably credited or charged  respectively  to income over the contract periods 
the relationship between net premiums written and net premiums earned will  therefore  vary depending generally on the volume and inception dates of the business assumed and ceded and the mix of such business between pro rata and excess of loss reinsurance 
the following table shows net premiums written  net premiums earned and net investment income of trh for the periods indicated years ended december  change change change from from from amount prior year amount prior year amount prior year dollars in millions net premiums written    net premiums earned    net investment income increasingly in more recent years  the reinsurance market has been characterized by significant competition worldwide in most classes 
the increases in net premiums written were primarily from treaty business and resulted from increased coverage provided 
on a worldwide basis  casualty lines business represented of net premiums written in versus in the prior year 
the balance represented property lines 
treaty business represented of net premiums written versus in the prior year 
the balance represented facultative accounts 
net premiums written by international offices increased in by million  or  over the prior year  to million 
most international offices recorded increases in net premiums written  led by paris and london 
trz recorded a significant decrease compared to as a result of the shift of their business to certain other trh offices  closer to source  and the selective retention of business in its core areas 
international net premiums written increased significantly in specialty casualty classes particularly other professional liability  automobile physical damage  automobile liability and aircraft lines  and decreased significantly in the fire line 
international business represented of net premiums written compared to in domestic net premiums written increased by million  or  over  to million  with significant increases recorded in the automobile liability line including nonstandard risks and certain specialty casualty classes particularly other professional liability and accident and health lines  and a significant decrease recorded in the medical malpractice line 
net premiums written increased in compared to the prior year  generally as a result of more favorable conditions in certain sectors of the market in as compared to other sectors  and due to the inclusion of a full year of net premiums written from trz in compared to six months net premiums written in  when trz was acquired 
such net premiums written by trz amounted to million in and million in net premiums written by international offices increased by million  or  to million in nearly all such offices recorded premium increases  led by trz  which reported an increase of million as discussed in the paragraph immediately above 
international net premiums written increased significantly in automobile liability  automobile physical damage  fire and allied lines 
international business represented of total net premiums written in as compared to in domestic net premiums written decreased to million 
significant decreases in general casualty  property and automobile liability lines including nonstandard risks were partially offset by increases in homeowners multi peril  aircraft and accident and health lines 
on a worldwide basis  casualty lines business represented of net premiums written in compared to in the prior year 
the balance represented property lines 
treaty business represented of net premiums written compared to in the balance represented facultative accounts 
the net increases noted above were primarily from treaty business and resulted from increased coverage provided 
the increase in net premiums earned in each of and compared to the respective prior year amounts resulted primarily from the significant growth in net premiums written in both years 
net investment income grew each year due to significant cash flow available for investment which was generated by operating activities 
the percentage of growth has decreased in each succeeding year due to generally lower available yields on bonds purchased as compared to yields on bonds disposed of in recent years and reduced operating cash flow in and compared to the immediately preceding year 
in  the lower yields are also due to the fact that trh had primarily been purchasing tax exempt bonds for its domestic portfolio to benefit its after tax results 
tax exempt bonds carry lower pre tax yields than taxable bonds that are comparable in risk and term to maturity due to their tax advantaged status 
in addition  in compared to  million of the increase in net investment income emanated from trz  due to the inclusion of its net investment income in only subsequent to its mid year acquisition date 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries use the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results  and does not include income from investments 
generally  a combined ratio under indicates an underwriting profit and a combined ratio exceeding indicates an underwriting loss 
the following table sets forth trh s combined ratios and the components thereof for the years indicated years ended december  loss and loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio trh s results included losses incurred of million related to hurricane georges 
in addition  as a result of net decreases in estimates of losses occurring in prior years  net losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced by million in significant favorable development was recorded in on losses occurring in years subsequent to in the other liability line  in and in the medical malpractice line and in through in the fire and allied lines 
these reductions to incurred losses were partially offset by adverse development in on losses occurring in and in the ocean marine line  prior to in the other liability line and in in the fire line 
trh s results did not include any significant catastrophe loss activity 
in addition  as a result of net decreases in estimates of losses occurring in prior years  net losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced by million in significant favorable development was recorded in on losses occurring in years subsequent to in the other liability line  in in the medical malpractice line and in and in certain property lines 
these reductions to incurred losses were partially offset by adverse development in on losses occurring in in aircraft and surety lines  in and in the medical malpractice line and in and prior in the other liability line 
trh s results did not include any significant catastrophe loss activity 
in addition  as a result of net decreases in estimates of losses occurring in prior years  net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were reduced by million in in the other liability line  favorable development on losses occurring in more recent years was offset by adverse development in and prior years 
in addition  in more recent years  favorable development  particularly in the fire  allied line and aircraft lines was partially offset by adverse development in the automobile liability line 
at december   reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled billion  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
also at december   reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
trh s reserves and related recoverables represent estimates of all future liability and reinsurance recoverable thereon for losses occurring on or prior to the balance sheet date 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income as incurred 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are principally based on reports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies 
a provision is included for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported on the basis of past experience and other factors 
the methods of making such estimates and for establishing the resulting reserves and related recoverables are continually reviewed and updated  and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently 
provisions for inflation and social inflation eg  awards by judges and juries which progressively increase in size at a rate exceeding that of general inflation are implicitly considered in the overall reserve setting process as an element of numerous judgments which are made as to expected trends in average claim severity 
because the reserving process is inherently difficult and subjective  actual net losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates of reserves and reinsurance recoverable on such amounts reflected in trh s consolidated financial statements 
reserves for the reinsurance of risks related to environmental impairment and asbestos related illnesses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of trh s environmental and asbestos related liabilities arise from contracts entered into after these obligations generally arose from contracts underwritten specifically as environmental or asbestos related coverages rather than from standard general liability coverages where the environmental or asbestos related liabilities were neither clearly defined nor specifically excluded 
the reserves carried for such claims  including incurred but not reported claims ibnr  are based upon known facts and current law 
however  significant uncertainty exists as  among other things  there are inconsistent court resolutions with respect to underlying policy intent and coverage and uncertainties as to the allocation of responsibility for resultant damages 
further  while there is always the threat of changes in statutes  laws  regulations and other factors that could have a material effect on these liabilities and  accordingly  future earnings  trh believes that these claims reserves  as well as all other claims reserves carried at december   are adequate 
the increase of the underwriting expense ratio in compared to and the decrease of the underwriting expense ratio in compared to were both due to changes in the ratio of net commissions to net premiums written  caused  in large part  by slight shifts in the mix of business between years 
other deductions generally include currency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
realized net capital gains on the disposition of investments totaled million in  million in and million in the high level of realized capital gains in compared to the other years presented resulted principally from the strategic realignment of the equity portfolio 
income before income taxes was million in  million in and million in the increase in income before income taxes in over resulted from increased realized capital gains and net investment income partially offset by a deterioration in underwriting results caused by losses from hurricane georges 
the increase in income before income taxes in over the prior year resulted from increased net investment income and realized net capital gains  and improved underwriting results 
the provisions for federal and foreign income taxes were million in  million in and million in the company and its domestic subsidiaries  trc and putnam reinsurance company putnam  filed consolidated federal income tax returns for the years under discussion  except those for which are not yet due 
the tax burden among the companies is allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement 
trc will include as part of its taxable income those items of income of the non us subsidiary  trz  which are subject to us income tax currently  pursuant to subpart f income rules of the internal revenue code  and included  as appropriate  in the consolidated federal income tax return 
the effective tax rates were in  in and in the increased effective tax rate in is due to the fact that while tax exempt income remained relatively level compared to the prior year  income subject to tax increased significantly  principally as a result of the increase in realized net capital gains 
net income and net income per common share on a diluted basis  respectively  were as follows million   million   million  
reasons for these increases are as discussed above 
per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the for common stock split paid in july see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition and liquidity as a holding company  the company s assets consist primarily of the stock of trc and the company s future cash flows depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from trc and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  trz and putnam 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of restrictions on dividend payment 
during  the company received cash dividends of million from trc 
sources of funds for the operating subsidiaries consist primarily of premiums  reinsurance recoverables  investment income and proceeds from sales  redemptions and the maturing of investments 
funds are applied primarily to payments of claims  ceded reinsurance premiums  insurance operating expenses  income taxes and investments in fixed income and equity securities 
premiums are generally received substantially in advance of related claims payments 
cash and cash equivalents are maintained for the payment of claims and expenses as they become due 
trh does not anticipate any material capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
at december   total investments and cash were  million compared to  million at december  this increase is principally due to net cash provided by operating activities which totaled million in  realized capital gains of million and an increase during the year in net unrealized appreciation of investments available for sale of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
trh s operating cash flow in declined compared to this decrease was due to a significant increase in paid losses and taxes paid and lesser increases in net commissions and operating expenses  offset in part by increased net premiums and net investment income received 
in addition  trh s operating cash flow in declined compared to this decrease was due to a significant increase in paid losses and lesser increases in net commissions  operating expenses and taxes paid  offset in part by increased net premiums and net investment income received 
in each of and as compared to the respective prior year  the increase in paid losses was principally due to increases in premium volume  a shift in the business mix in more recent years towards lines with shorter loss payment patterns  and in  increased catastrophe losses paid 
international operations  most significantly london  accounted for approximately  and of operating cash flow in  and  respectively 
trh believes that its balance of cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  and its future cash flows will be sufficient to meet trh s cash requirements through the end of and thereafter for a period the length of which is difficult to predict  but which trh believes will be at least one year 
trh s fixed maturity investments  approximately of total investments as of december   are predominantly investment grade  liquid securities concentrated in maturities of less than years 
also as of that date  approximately of total investments were in common and nonredeemable preferred stocks  approximately of total investments were in other invested assets  including investments in partnerships  and the remaining consisted of short term investments 
based on the foregoing  trh considers its liquidity to be adequate through the end of and thereafter for a period the length of which is difficult to predict  but which trh believes will be at least one year 
as of december   a significant portion of the bond portfolio was classified as available for sale and carried at market value 
fixed maturity investments are carried at amortized cost when it is trh s positive intent to hold these securities to maturity and trh has the ability to do so 
most activity within the bonds available for sale portfolio for the years under discussion represented strategic portfolio realignments  partially for tax purposes 
trh adjusts its mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  as appropriate  generally as a result of strategic investment and tax planning considerations 
as of december   bonds held to maturity had gross unrealized gains of million and no gross unrealized losses 
gross unrealized gains and losses on bonds available for sale as of december  amounted to million and million  respectively 
as of december   of the bond portfolio were rated aaa or aa  an additional were also rated investment grade or better  were rated below investment grade and were not rated 
also  as of december   trh had no derivative instruments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
trh s operations are exposed to market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss of fair market value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies 
such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques 
one such technique is value at risk var 
var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability 
trh believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk 
while var models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models 
therefore  such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management 
trh has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for financial instruments for each type of market risk 
in this analysis  financial instrument assets include all investments and cash and accrued investment income 
financial instrument liabilities include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  and unearned premiums 
trh calculated the var as of december  this calculation used the variance covariance delta normal methodology 
the calculation also used daily historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices in the two years ended december  the var model estimated the volatility of each of these rates and equity prices and the correlation among them 
for interest rates  each country s yield curve was constructed using eleven separate points on this curve to model possible curve movements 
inter country correlations were also used 
the redemption experience of municipal and corporate fixed maturities as well as the use of financial modeling were employed in the analysis process 
thus  the var measured the sensitivity of the asset and the liability portfolios to each of the aforementioned market risk exposures 
each sensitivity was estimated separately to capture the market risk 
the following table presents the var of each component of market risk as of december  market risk amount in millions interest rate currency equity each sensitivity was then applied to a database which contained both historical ranges of movements in all market factors and the correlations among them 
the results were aggregated to provide a single amount that depicts the maximum potential loss in fair value at a confidence level of percent for a time period of one month 
var with respect to the aggregate of the three components of market risk cannot be derived by summing the individual risk amounts in the table above 
at december   the var for trh s financial instruments was approximately million 
trh s stockholders equity increased to billion at december   an increase of million over year end the net increase was comprised principally of net income of million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million principally unrealized currency translation gain  net of income taxes  partially offset by dividends declared of million 
unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments  net of deferred income taxes  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  is subject to significant volatility resulting from changes in the market value of bonds and equities available for sale 
market values may fluctuate due to changes in general economic conditions  market interest rates and other factors 
risk based capital rbc standards  promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  relate an individual company s statutory policyholders surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations and sets thresholds at which certain company and regulatory corrective actions are mandated 
at december   the statutory surpluses of trc and putnam each significantly exceeded rbc requirements 
accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement established new financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans  including stock option and stock purchase plans 
compensation resulting from the award of stock based compensation must be determined based on the fair value of consideration received or fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
such compensation expense  net of income taxes  may be recognized in the statement of operations over the service period of the employee generally the vesting period 
in lieu of recording such compensation expense  entities are permitted to disclose its pro forma impact  net of income taxes  on reported net income and earnings per share 
entities choosing such disclosure will continue to measure compensation expense from stock based compensation in the statement of operations based on the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with the standard  trh adopted sfas no 
beginning with the annual financial statements and chose the pro forma disclosure option of implementation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
in addition  it provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas no 
was effective as of january  and was to be applied prospectively 
however  sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 
 deferred for one year the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 
which affect repurchase agreements  dollar rolls  securities lending and similar transactions 
the implementation of these standards  which occurred on their respective effective dates  did not have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share 
as compared to the prior standard  sfas no 
simplifies computational guidelines  revises disclosure requirements and increases earnings per share eps comparability on an international basis 
basic eps  which is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  replaced primary eps from the prior standard 
for all periods reported by trh prior to implementation of the standard  basic eps would have been the same as primary eps  since the impact of the company s common stock equivalents principally stock options for those periods did not reach the significance threshold prescribed to require adjustment under the prior standard 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps from the prior standard 
for all entities with complex capital structures  basic and diluted eps must be shown on the face of the income statement with equal prominence 
in addition  a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator from the basic eps computation to the diluted eps computation is required 
see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the standard  trh adopted sfas no 
for the annual financial statements and restated all prior period eps data presented 
also in february  the securities and exchange commission sec issued financial reporting release frr no 
 disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
frr no 
amends rules and forms for registrants and requires clarification and expansion of existing disclosures for derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  as defined therein 
the amendments require enhanced disclosure with respect to these derivative instruments in the notes to financial statements 
during the three year period ending december   trh has had no derivative instruments 
additionally  the amendments expand existing disclosure requirements to include quantitative and qualitative discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion with respect to market risk inherent in market risk sensitive instruments such as equity and fixed maturity securities  as well as derivative instruments 
these amendments are designed to provide additional information about market risk sensitive instruments which investors can use to better understand and evaluate market risk exposures of registrants 
for trh  these disclosures are included for in management s discussion which accompanies these financial statements and related notes 
in june  the fasb adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in stockholders equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources and includes net income and all changes in stockholders equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distribution to owners 
this standard requires that an enterprise a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
in accordance with the standard  trh adopted sfas no 
in comparable data from prior years are presented in conformity with the new standard 
also in june  the fasb adopted sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial statements and requires presentation of a measure of profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items and segment assets 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers  superseding most of sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
sfas no 
requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
the enterprise must report information about the revenues derived  countries in which it earns revenues and holds assets and major customers regardless of whether that information is used in making operating decisions 
however  this statement does not require an enterprise to report information that is not prepared for internal use if reporting it would be impracticable 
sfas no 
is effective for trh s financial statements 
this statement need not be applied to interim financial statements in the initial year of its application  but comparative information for interim periods in the initial year of application is to be reported in financial statements for interim periods in the second year of application 
trh has adopted this standard for the annual financial statements and has provided comparable prior year data 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives must be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
the accounting recognition for the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors  including the intended use of the derivative 
sfas no 
is effective for trh as of january  and may not be applied retroactively 
trh presently has no derivative instruments 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  deposit accounting accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk 
this statement provides guidance on how to account for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer both required elements of insurance risk ie  underwriting risk and timing risk 
sop will be effective for trh on january  restatement of previously issued annual financial statements is not permitted 
management believes that the impact of applying this statement will not be material to results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
other matters the year yk issue arises from the historic usage of two  rather than four  digit date fields in computer equipment  software packages and other devices using embedded chip technology  causing a date field to be recognized as the year  rather than the year failure to recognize  repair or replace affected devices and systems could cause systems failures or other disruptions resulting in  among other things  an inability to process transactions  collect premiums  pay invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
most trh systems and software packages were installed or purchased within the last five years  when the yk issue had already been identified and was usually a consideration in the development process 
trh has taken steps to identify its significant systems and programs  new and existing  hardware and software information technology it as well as non it eg  telephone systems  fax machines and copiers  where yk failures could surface  and has effected remedial changes and conducted appropriate testing 
this process is essentially complete for all critical systems 
the costs associated with this process  which are expensed as incurred  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on net income  financial position  cash flows or other non yk it projects and initiatives 
in addition  trh has identified those ceding companies  brokers  reinsurers  vendors and other business partners collectively third parties that are significant to its business and has asked each to advise on the steps they are taking to address the yk issue 
responses have been received from most and follow up requests have been sent to those who failed to respond or whose responses were not satisfactory 
the completion of these activities and corrective actions  where necessary  will continue during trh does not presently believe that yk issues related to its internal it and non it systems pose significant operational problems 
although trh continues to monitor third party readiness  it cannot provide assurance that unresolved yk issues of such parties will not have a material adverse impact on trh s operations or financial results 
trh will continue to consider the effects of potential unresolved yk issues of third parties on its business and develop contingency plans  as necessary 
such plans may include the selection of alternate third parties or other actions designed to mitigate the effects of a third party s lack of preparedness 
on january   certain of the member nations of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted a common currency  the euro 
once the national currencies are phased out  the euro will be the sole legal tender of each of these nations 
during the transition period  commerce of these nations will be transacted in the euro or in the currently existing national currency 
trh has taken the necessary steps to transact business in the euro  has identified the significant issues and will be prepared with respect to the continued phase in of and ultimate redenomination to the euro 
any costs associated with the adoption of the euro are expensed as incurred and are not material to trh s net income  financial position or cash flows 
any statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts  or that might be considered an opinion or projection  whether expressed or implied  are meant as  and should be considered  forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are based on assumptions and opinions concerning a variety of known and unknown risks 
if any assumptions or opinions prove incorrect  any forward looking statements made on that basis may also prove materially incorrect
