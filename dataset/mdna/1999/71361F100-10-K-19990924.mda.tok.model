item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview perceptron  inc perceptron or the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets information based measurement and inspection focused solutions for process improvement primarily for the automotive and forest products industries 
the company s current principal products are based upon proprietary three dimensional image processing and feature extraction software algorithms combined with two distinct three dimensional object imaging technologies tricam tm and lasar tm 
tricam tm technology uses structured laser light triangulation techniques to obtain accurate three dimensional measurements 
tricam tm systems are used to measure formed parts for process control  to provide robot guidance for automated assembly tasks and to perform non contact alignment functions 
tricam tm is also used by the forest products business unit to measure three dimensional shapes of trees  logs  boards and by products 
lasar tm provides accurate three dimensional measurements of a full scene over a larger field of view than does tricam tm 
the lasar tm product is used by the forest products business unit for the three dimensional measurement of stems  logs and cants 
the company has two business segments the automotive business unit segment and the forest products business unit segment 
the company s automotive business unit has sold its products primarily to north american  european and  to a lesser extent  asian and south american automobile manufacturers 
historically  sales to automotive customers have typically depended primarily on new model re tooling programs 
accordingly  sales may vary significantly among customers on a year to year and quarter to quarter basis 
the company s forest products business unit has sold its products primarily to north american sawmills  sawmill machinery manufacturers and systems integrators 
on june   the company elected to change its reporting period from a calendar year ending december  to a fiscal year ending june as a result  this form k represents a transition period report covering the period january  through june  the first full year to be reported on a fiscal year basis will be for the twelve month period ended june  in october  the company acquired the assets and ultrasound intellectual property  and assumed certain liabilities  of sonic industries  inc and sonic technologies  inc sonic of hatboro  pennsylvania 
sonic designs and markets ultrasound scanning systems  principally for forest product applications 
results of operations six months ended june   compared to six months ended june  overview 
the company reported a net loss of million per share for the six months ended june  compared to a loss of million per share in the same period 
net sales of million for the six months ended june  were up million  or  over the comparable period sales of million 
automotive sales accounted for of total sales during the six months ended june  compared to in the same period 
forest product sales represented of total sales for compared to in the six months ended june  net domestic sales remained flat at million for both the and six month periods ended june net international sales increased million from million in the six months ended june  to million in the six month period 
gross profit as a percent of net sales for the period was compared to in principally reflecting both competitive pricing pressure on the company s mature product lines and the effect of currency declines principally in the deutsch mark 
operating expenses were up million in the six months ended june  compared to  reflecting higher costs for research and development work on new products  the company s global marketing initiatives  incremental expenses associated with the ultrasound technology acquisition and certain non recurring and unusual items for aged accounts receivable primarily related to the company s autospect and trident systems operations 
the six month comparison also reflects reduced net interest income of  as a result of lower cash balances and higher other expenses of  for legal fees related to a civil action discussed in item  legal proceedings 
automotive 
sales in the six months ended june  increased million  or  to million compared to million in p sales accounted for approximately of net automotive sales in the period compared to approximately in the same period of rgs and nca systems sales accounted for of net sales in compared to in the variance in rgs and nca sales is a function of the timing of orders by the company s customers 
other product sales  which during the six month period included early sales of the company s new products principally the company s web based intelligent process network ipnet and the first developmental system to inspect wet film paint thickness  represented of net automotive sales as compared to in the six month period 
training and service revenues accounted for the remainder of net sales in both years 
forest products 
sales in the six months ended june  were million  down  or from the comparable period sales of million 
the lower sales level in the period reflected postponement of capital purchases in late by mills affected by the soft dimension lumber market 
during the six months ended june   the company sold its first lumber analyzer system  an ultrasound technology product that the company acquired in the fourth quarter of bookings backlog 
new order bookings for the six months ended june  were million compared to million in the period 
automotive bookings totaled million in the period compared to million a year ago 
the increased automotive bookings in is primarily related to orders for the company s new ipnet product and rgs and nca systems 
forest product bookings were million in compared to million a year ago 
the period includes a million two year blanket order for the lumber analyzer system 
the new order bookings net of sales resulted in a backlog at june  of million compared to million in the amount of new order bookings and the level of backlog during any particular period is not necessarily indicative of the future operating performance of the company 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of sales  in the six months ended june   as compared to million  or of sales  in the six months

outlook 
based on the backlog as of june   the current rate of new orders and the prospects for its new products  the company s near term sales outlook is good and  as a result  performance over the next several quarters is expected to improve relative to comparable periods one year ago 
the foregoing statements contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including those described under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement  below 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales of million in decreased by million  or  compared with net sales of million in net domestic sales decreased from million in to million in net international sales decreased from million in to million in the total decrease in net sales for was principally accounted for by a million  or  decrease in sales of p systems and a million  or  decrease in sales of rgs and nca systems 
because the p system has been widely received  particularly in north america  by the automotive industry for several years  the sales decline for this system was not unexpected 
the rgs and nca systems decrease was primarily due to the timing of new orders 
forest products sales were up slightly compared with p systems accounted for of net sales in and of net sales in the rgs and nca systems combined accounted for of net sales in and in forest products sales accounted for of net sales in and of net sales in training and service revenues and other product sales accounted for the remainder of net sales in both years 
new order bookings for totaled million  compared to million in domestic orders declined from million in to million in while international orders were up from million in to million in p systems accounted for of new order bookings in and in rgs and nca bookings accounted for of bookings in and in forest product bookings were of the total in and in training and service and other product sales accounted for the remainder of net bookings in both years 
the decrease in new order bookings in compared with was principally due to rgs and nca systems and  to a lesser extent  lower orders for p systems  forest product systems  and autospect paint inspection systems 
rgs and  in particular nca systems  orders were down due to the timing of new blanket purchase orders from several customers 
the forest product systems order decline reflected  forest industry cash constraints related to weak demand for lumber and reduced orders for lasar based systems due to required system reengineering 
autospect paint inspection systems new orders were lower than anticipated due to delays in new product development 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or  of sales in compared with million  or  of sales in the percentage decrease was due primarily to the lower sales volume which led to under absorbed fixed overhead and  to a lesser extent  sales mix and higher manufacturing  warranty and installation costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or  of sales in compared with million  or  of sales in this increase was due primarily to added personnel and associated expenses  such as travel and telephone  required to support the development of domestic and international markets for automotive and forest products 
incremental cost increases associated with the acquisitions during and also contributed to the year over year spending increase 
engineering  research and development 
engineering  research and development expenses increased from million  or of sales in  to million  or of sales in the increase was primarily due to additional personnel as well as higher material and testing expenditures to support products under development 
intangible asset write off 
during  the company developed a new suite of non contact three dimensional measurement technologies  which superceded certain existing technologies recorded as intangible assets 
as a result  the carrying value of these intangible assets was evaluated for impairment 
this evaluation resulted in a write off of intangible assets with a net book value of million 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased from approximately million in to million in  due to lower average cash balances during year ended december   compared to year ended december  net sales the company s net sales increased by from million in to million in net domestic sales increased from million in to million in net international sales increased from million in to million in the total increase in net sales for was accounted for by a increase in sales of p systems  a increase in sales of rgs and nca systems  and a increase in the sale of forest product systems in north america 
p systems accounted for of net sales in and of net sales in the rgs and nca systems combined accounted for of net sales in and in forest products sales accounted for of net sales in and of net sales in training and service revenues and other product sales accounted for the remainder of net sales in both years 
new order bookings for totaled million  compared to million in domestic orders were up from million in to million in and international orders were up from million in to million in p systems accounted for of new order bookings in and in rgs and nca bookings accounted for of bookings in and in forest product bookings were of the total in and in training and service and other product sales accounted for the remainder of net bookings in both years 
the increase in new order bookings in was principally due to forest product orders  orders for rgs and nca systems and orders for autospect paint inspection products  offset by a decline in p orders 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in to million in  and as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the percentage increase is due primarily to increased sales of higher gross margin products and  to a lesser extent  to the lower gross profit percentage associated with sales by the company of a new product  which was integrated into equipment acquired from an original equipment manufacturer oem  and sold as a complete system in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in this increase is due primarily to increases in personnel and various operating expenses required to support the increased operating activity and  to a lesser extent  to costs associated with the recent acquisitions partially offset by decreased management performance bonuses 
additionally  expenses included a non recurring charge related to a special compensation program at one of the acquired companies 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in engineering  research and development 
engineering  research and development expenses increased by  from million in  to approximately million in  due primarily to increased personnel and  to a lesser extent  to increased expenditures for materials associated with products under development 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering  research and development expenses increased from in to in non cash stock compensation expense 
during  some participants in the company s stock option plan used perceptron stock options to pay the exercise price of stock options issued under the plan 
accounting rules required the recording of a non cash compensation expense relating to these exercises 
the company took action to eliminate the provision in its stock option plans which otherwise might have resulted in similar non cash stock compensation expense in and future years 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  increased from approximately million in to million in  due to increased cash balances and related investing activities during income before provision for income taxes 
in  perceptron had income before provision for income taxes of approximately million representing of net sales  as compared to income before provision for income taxes of approximately million representing of net sales 
without the non cash stock compensation charge  the results for would have been million  or of net sales in net income 
net income in was million  or of net sales  resulting in per diluted share 
in  net income was million  or of net sales  resulting in 
per diluted share 
excluding the non cash stock option compensation expense  the net income would have been million  of net sales  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources for the six month period ended june  the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at june   compared to million at december  the decrease of million in cash for the six months resulted primarily from million used in operations and million used for capital spending  offset by million of cash provided from financing activities 
the use of cash for operations reflected the net loss for the quarter adjusted for non cash items  offset by reductions in working capital requirements 
receivables decreased million as a result of collections and a lower sales level in the first six months of compared to the last six months of the increase of  in inventory primarily represented purchases of component parts needed to fulfill orders 
the decrease in accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities totaling million primarily reflected the timing of payments and a lower expense level in the second quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of financing activities during the six month period ended june  reflected net working capital borrowings of million 
also in the first quarter of  the company completed its stock repurchase program with the purchase of  shares of its common stock for  the company may buy shares of its common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time  based on market prices  to meet the continuing share requirements of the company s stock based incentive programs 
at june   the company had a million unsecured revolving credit agreement revolver that expires on may  proceeds under the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes and can be designated as a floating rate loan or as a eurodollar rate loan 
interest on floating rate borrowings is calculated daily at below the bank s prime rate which was as of august  and is payable on the last day of each month

the company had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at june  the company believes that available cash on hand and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its currently anticipated fiscal year cash flow requirements 
the company does not believe that inflation has significantly impacted historical operations and does not expect any significant near term inflationary impact 
the company expects to spend approximately million during fiscal year for capital equipment  although there is no binding commitment to do so 
for a discussion of certain contingencies relating to the company s financial position and results of operations  see note to the consolidated financial statements  contingencies 
for the twelve month period ended december  the company s cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million  compared with million as of december  the use of cash was due primarily to  million for operations after adjusting for non cash charges  increased inventories of million and other working capital needs of million  capital spending of million  stock repurchase of million and the acquisition of sonic assets for million 
these cash outflows were partially offset by  the sale of marketable securities of million and proceeds from exercises of stock options of million 
the inventory increase was due primarily to higher levels of work in process and finished goods inventories to support future deliveries 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during repurchased shares primarily will be used to offset the company s requirements for share issuances under its various stock based incentive programs 
euro conversion a single currency called the euro was introduced in europe on january  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
fixed conversion rates between these participating countries existing currencies the legacy currencies and the euro were established as of that date 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until at least january  but not later than july  
during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s legacy currency 
conversion to the euro may reduce the amount of the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  due to the netting effect of having assets and liabilities denominated in a single currency as opposed to the various legacy currencies 
conversely  because there will be less diversity in the company s exposure to foreign currencies  movements in the euro s value in us dollars could have a more pronounced effect  whether positive or negative  on the company 
year readiness disclosure year overview an issue affecting the company is the potential inability of many computer systems and applications to process information in the year and beyond 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations the year capability issue 
programs that will operate in the year unaffected by the change in year from to are referred to herein as year compliant 
the disclosure below is intended to summarize the company s actions to minimize the risk 
certain portions of the discussion set forth below contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  but not limited to  those relating to the compliance of the company s products and systems to operate under the year issue  future costs to remediate year issues  the timetable in which such remediation is to occur  the alternatives available to the company to fully address year issues  the company s requirements and the impact on the company of an inability of it or its key suppliers and customers to fully address year issues 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statement due to a number of uncertainties set forth below 
year state of readiness the company has forward date tested the current version of its principal products and believes that the current versions  and all versions currently under warranty  are capable of operating in the year the company s products operate on computers and operating systems supplied by third party vendors 
the company s customers have been advised to conduct their own forward date tests on such systems and to contact the third party vendors regarding available upgrades or other remediation efforts 
the company s principal customers are automotive companies and forest and wood products processors and system integrators who sell to such customers 
because of the size and level of year compliance activity by these customers  the company expects most of these customers will become year capable in a timely fashion 
however  the company is not monitoring their progress in this regard 
if any of the company s customers are unable to become year capable in a timely fashion  it is possible they could suspend product purchases from the company until their systems have addressed the year issue 
the company is in the process of contacting its principal vendors and suppliers all of which are referred to as third party suppliers to determine if they are year capable 
the company also intends to order extra material from critical third party suppliers of its product components and parts during the fourth quarter of to provide buffer stock in the event supply is disrupted 
the failure of one or more critical third party suppliers including utility and similar providers to be year capable such that its supply of needed products or services is interrupted could result in the company not being able to produce one or more of its systems for a period of time  which in turn could result in lost sales and profits 
the company has established a project team to identify internal systems which are not year capable and complete the work required to mitigate the year issue 
the company s principal information technology it systems are located at its headquarters in plymouth  michigan 
these systems consist of a financial system  which the company has forward date tested and believes is year capable  and an operations system provided by a third party vendor 
another third party vendor was engaged to make the operating system year compliant 
the work has been completed and the system tested off site and found to be compliant 
the changes will be implemented and tested live at the company s headquarters early in the fourth calendar quarter of the company also has a number of engineering systems  used primarily for testing  developed by the company s internal staff 
the company forward date tested these systems during the first calendar quarter of and believes it has completed the remediation and testing necessary to make them year compliant 
the company s subsidiaries believe that they have completed the modifications and testing necessary to make their it systems  which are generally small networks of personal computers  year compliant 
the company maintains networks of personal computers 
using internal personnel  the company has assessed its personal computer networks for year compliance 
modifications necessary to effect individual personal computer year compliance have been completed and modifications required to achieve year compliance to certain components of the network are expected to be completed during the fourth calendar quarter of the company s personal computer systems generally operate using shrink wrapped software such as microsoft windows  microsoft word and excel 
to the extent any of the programs used by the personal computer systems are not year compliant  the company believes that year capable upgrades are or will be readily available for purchase 
a failure of one or more of the company s internal systems to become year compliant  particularly the company s principal internal information technology systems  could require the company to manually process information or could prevent or limit access to mission critical information 
the company s non it systems consist principally of security  climate control  telephone and data communication systems 
the company has contacted the vendors that support these systems  at the company s headquarters  each of which believes its system to be year compliant 
year costs most of the costs incurred by the company to date on year compliance issues have been internal staff costs and costs relating to normal product upgrades  which the company has not separately tracked 
as a result  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of such expenditures 
the company presently estimates that its future costs relating to year compliance issues  including replacement systems  will be less than  the company would have incurred many of the costs for these efforts in any event because of the normal process of product and equipment upgrades 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of uncertainties  which could result in actual costs exceeding the estimated amounts described below 
costs related to the year issue are funded through operating cash flow 
the year costs have not caused the company to defer any other significant information technology programs 
year risks and contingency plans the company s year project team has evaluated business disruption scenarios  principally related to the company s internal systems for processing information and the purchase of goods and services to maintain timely production 
the team has developed and implemented the plans disclosed previously under year state of readiness 
estimates of time  costs and risks associated with the year issue are based on currently available information 
developments that could affect estimates include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code and systems  cooperation and remediation success of the company s suppliers and customers and their suppliers and customers  the ability to correctly anticipate risks and implement suitable contingency plans in the event of system failures at the company or its suppliers or customers and their suppliers and customers  unanticipated difficulties with the assessment or remediation process resulting in the need to replace more systems or hire more personnel or third party firms to assist in the process than expected and the company being required to assist any of its third party suppliers to become year compliant 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
in addition  it is possible that there will be undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions in the company s current products or internal systems or those of its third party suppliers and their suppliers and customers 
because of the unprecedented nature of litigation in this area  it is uncertain how the company may be affected by it 
in the event of such litigation or the occurrence of production disruptions related to third party suppliers  internal issues  or customers  it is possible the company s revenues  net income or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
market risk information perceptron s primary market risk is related to foreign exchange rates 
this risk is derived from sales by its international operations  which are primarily located in germany and the netherlands and for which products are produced in the us the company is also subject to interest rate risk in connection with its borrowings 
at june   the company did not have any market risk instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk the company has limited foreign currency exchange risk in its international operations due to the percentage of contracts entered into in us dollars and the short time period between sales commitment and delivery for contracts in the non us currencies 
the company s percentage of sales commitments in non us dollars at june  was 
for sales commitments entered into in the non us currencies  the currency rate risk exposure is predominantly less than one year with the majority in the to day range 
see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations euro conversion 
the company may use  from time to time  a limited hedging program to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
as the company exports products  it may enter into limited hedging transactions relating to the accounts receivable arising as a result of such shipment 
these transactions involve the use of forward contracts 
at june   the company had no forward contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under its variable rate revolving line of credit and from fixed rate debt assumed in conjunction with the purchase of ultrasound intellectual property in october however  this risk is limited due to the limited level of debt the company has outstanding 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in the prime rate and changes in eurodollar rates in the london interbank market 
see note of notes to consolidated statements for a description of the company s outstanding debt 
new accounting pronouncements in  the company adopted statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed for internal use 
sop requires the capitalization of internal use software and specifically identifies which costs should be capitalized and which costs should be expensed 
adoption of this sop did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in  the company adopted sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop generally requires costs of start up and organizational activities to be expensed as incurred and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this sop did not have material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb delayed the implementation date making the statement effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires recognition of all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  measured at fair value and sets forth conditions in which a derivative instrument may be designated as a hedge 
the statement requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to be recorded to other comprehensive income or to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings 
the company from time to time engages in hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
management is currently assessing the effect that this pronouncement may have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
safe harbor statement certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  including the company s expectation as to fiscal and future revenue and earnings levels  the timing of new product releases and the expansion of the company into new markets 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the dependence of the company s revenue on a number of sizable orders from a small number of customers  the timing of orders and shipments which can cause the company to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual revenue and operating results  timely receipt of required supplies and components which could result in delays in anticipated shipments  general product demand and market acceptance risks  the ability of the company to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies  the timing and continuation of the automotive industry s retooling programs  the ability of the company to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies  the ability of the company to identify and satisfy market needs  general product development and commercialization difficulties  the quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future  the level of interest existing and potential new customers may have in new products and technologies generally  rapid or unexpected technological changes  the impact of undetected errors or defects associated with the year date functions on the company and its suppliers  and the effect of economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in the domestic and worldwide automotive and forest products industries  both of which have from time to time been subject to cyclical downturns due to the level of demand for  or supply of  the products produced by companies in these industries
