item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview waterlink is an international provider of integrated water purification and wastewater treatment solutions  principally to industrial and municipal customers 
waterlink was incorporated in delaware on december  and has grown externally by completing thirteen acquisitions 
during fiscal waterlink focused on the implementation of its strategic operating plan 
the plan was implemented in three phases the restructuring phase  the cost reduction phase  and the growth phase 
the restructuring phase was completed prior to october   the beginning of waterlink s recently completed fiscal year  and restructured waterlink from a company that completed acquisitions consisting of separate operating companies into the following five fully integrated operating divisions that are focused on their specific markets the biological wastewater treatment division the separations division the pure water division the specialty products division the european water and wastewater division this divisional structure allows waterlink to utilize the strengths of its complementary product lines and brand name to work closer with customers 
the cost reduction phase established goals of reducing selling  general and administrative expenses by million in fiscal  principally by reducing the number of employees by  or approximately of the work force  and by closing seven facilities 
waterlink has decided to curtail its manufacturing activities whenever possible  in favor of partnering with vendors who manufacture components used in our systems and equipment 
as of september   the total number of employees has been reduced by people  in excess of the originally contemplated by the plan  and the annualized cost savings goal of million has been surpassed by approximately million 
with regard to facilities  seven have been closed 
the cost reduction phase also includes an initiative to reduce production costs by identifying common suppliers among divisions and consolidating purchases to increase waterlink s purchasing power 
supply contracts with these common vendors are expected to provide cost savings to help waterlink remain competitive in the long term 
the growth phase of the plan has added sales and marketing professionals in fiscal  in order to improve revenue performance over the long term 
these additional costs are being funded  in part  by the additional million of annualized savings as a result of the cost reduction phase of the plan 
the improved communications and specific identification of markets and products resulting from the restructuring of waterlink  together with the reinvestment in sales and marketing professionals  are intended to allow waterlink to increase its sales efforts 
two specific areas of focus are the implementation of a key account program with selected worldwide buyers of waterlink product offerings  and our integrated systems effort that is expected to provide more interdivisional cross selling opportunities with certain key customers 
waterlink is also developing sales strategies in regions where we do not currently have a significant presence or wish to increase our opportunities  such as south america  as well as servicing companies competing for municipal privatization contracts in the united states 
in the future  we believe these efforts will build waterlink into a sales  marketing and engineering leader in the industry  focused on profitable growth over the long term 
waterlink s new organization is also designed to more efficiently integrate future acquisitions 
waterlink s current capital structure does not support an aggressive acquisition program 
waterlink intends to improve its capital structure through a combination of improved operating performance and access to capital markets  which we expect will enable us to resume our acquisition program 
acquisitions are expected to play a strategic role in waterlink s future to increase competitiveness  spur revenue and earnings growth  and enhance our total solutions capability 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in the results of operations for the period subsequent to the effective date of acquisition 
due to the timing and magnitude of these acquisitions  results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily comparable or indicative of operating results for current or future periods 
the majority of the systems and equipment produced by waterlink are custom designed and take a number of months to produce 
revenues from large contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in the proportion that costs incurred bear to total estimated costs at completion 
revisions of estimated costs or potential contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
provisions are made currently for all known or anticipated losses 
variations from estimated contract performance could result in a material adjustment to operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenues when collection is probable 
revenues from remaining systems and equipment sales are recognized when shipped 
in the past waterlink has experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results due to the contractual nature of its business and the consequent timing of these orders 
in the future  waterlink expects that it may receive contracts that are significantly larger than those received by waterlink historically 
in addition  certain of the contracts will be subject to the customer s ability to finance  or fund from government sources  the actual costs of completing the project as well as the ability to receive any necessary permits to commence the project 
therefore  waterlink expects that its future operating results could fluctuate significantly  especially on a quarterly basis  due to the timing of the awarding of such contracts  the ability to fund project costs  and the recognition by waterlink of revenues and profits 
in addition  waterlink has historically operated with a moderate backlog 
however  as a result of its strategic plan  waterlink anticipates that both the dollar volume and number of contracts in its backlog will increase 
as of september   waterlink s total backlog was approximately million  consisting of million of written purchase orders for capital goods equipment and million of firm commitments to purchase recurring revenue products from our specialty products division 
quarterly sales and operating results will be affected by the volume and timing of contracts received and performed within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
any significant deferral or cancellation of a contract could have a material adverse effect on waterlink s operating results in any particular period 
because of these factors  waterlink believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performances 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges amortization operating income loss other income expense interest expense interest income and other items net income loss before income taxes income taxes income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item  net of tax net income loss year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was due to the acquisition of chemitreat services  inc  on march   of aquafine engineering services limited and purac engineering incorporated in a single transaction on march   and of the specialty products division on june  waterlink experienced negative internal growth for the year of  resulting primarily from significant revenues generated by german based sales activity and a utah based land development wastewater project in the prior year 
excluding these two factors  internal growth would have declined by due to the timing of orders at two specific domestic locations 
further  if currency rate fluctuations were excluded  negative internal growth for the nine months would have been 
waterlink measures internal growth by comparing each subsidiary s net sales from the months subsequent to their respective acquisition dates during the prior year to those same months in the current year 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year due to the acquisitions 
gross margin was for the period as compared to for we decided to discontinue the manufacturing processes for our great lakes subsidiary product line in favor of utilizing subcontractors 
as a result of this decision  during the year ended september   waterlink recognized  of costs  comprised of  of cost overruns that took place on a contractual obligation and  of inventory write downs and other costs 
absent the  of costs associated with the exit of the great lakes facility  the gross margin would have been for the year ended september  the adjusted gross margin of is lower than the realized in primarily due to the june acquisition of the specialty products division  which historically experiences lower margins as compared to other waterlink divisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in as compared to for the prior year 
this decrease primarily reflects the costs savings realized from waterlink s plan  as well as the impact of the june acquisition of the specialty products division  which historically experiences a lower percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as compared to other waterlink divisions 
the selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were increased by a charge of  from the write off of costs associated with acquisition activity that ceased during the year 
special charges 
special charges of  during the year ended september  related to the following continuing costs of  associated with the implementation of waterlink s plan  primarily related to termination benefits and facility consolidation costs 
in conjunction with our plan  we determined that we would exit the acquired bioclear business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the assets of bioclear  primarily related to bioclear s manufacturing facility located in winnipeg  canada  were reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
based on difficulties encountered during the sales process  we further reduced the estimated net realizable value of these remaining assets by  additional severance benefits of  were incurred during fiscal not originally contemplated by the plan 
additional charges of  related to severance benefits during fiscal related to the announced retirement of our chairman of the board 
during waterlink incurred special charges of  related to the following waterlink recorded a charge of  primarily related to termination benefits and costs associated with the exiting of certain facilities to implement our plan 
as a result of our decision to exit the bioclear business  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  waterlink recorded a non cash charge of  consisting of  related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the june acquisition of bioclear technology  inc and  to write off the cumulative translation adjustment component of bioclear s equity 
waterlink incurred special charges of  primarily attributable to contractual obligations to our former chief executive officer  who resigned in june  and costs necessary to recruit executives to waterlink 
amortization 
amortization expense for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the additional goodwill resulting from the fiscal acquisitions  offset by  reduction in amortization expense resulting from the exit of waterlink s bioclear business during the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year primarily due to increased borrowings related to waterlink s fiscal acquisitions 
interest expense for includes a primarily non cash financing charge of  related to the amortization of the value assigned to warrants issued to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
income taxes 
waterlink recorded income taxes of  on a pre tax loss of  for the year ended september  this income tax expense was recorded on earnings outside the united states and in certain states domestically 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was due to the timing of the acquisitions completed during fiscal waterlink experienced negative internal growth for the year of  resulting principally from the timing of orders  exchange rate fluctuations and stronger performance for specific domestic locations during fiscal that was not duplicated in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions previously described 
gross margin was for as compared to for gross margins were impacted in by the march acquisition of the nordic water products group and the june acquisition of the specialty products division  both of which historically experience lower margins as compared to other waterlink divisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions previously described 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was for as compared to for this decrease primarily reflects the spreading of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
special charges 
during the year ended september   waterlink incurred special charges of  these special charges consisted of the following three components waterlink recorded a charge of  primarily related to termination benefits and costs associated with the exiting of facilities in connection with the implementation of our plan 
waterlink recorded a non cash charge of  consisting of  related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the june acquisition of bioclear and  to write off the cumulative translation adjustment component of bioclear s equity 
with regard to the  impairment charge  our plan includes waterlink s decision to exit the acquired business of bioclear 
several factors lead to this decision including i 
the lack of orders at bioclear in fiscal led to a comprehensive market review  which was completed in august this analysis indicated that bioclear s originally perceived niche market was not reliable and possibly nonexistent 
ii 
in order to compete in more traditional markets  bioclear s proprietary product would need to be reengineered  at great expense  to significantly reduce the water treatment cost per gallon 
in addition  this reengineered proprietary product would not guarantee success due to the extremely competitive traditional marketplace 
iii 
in july  bioclear s founder  a former owner and president  resigned 
iv 
in august  bioclear s chief engineer and a former owner announced his desire to reduce his involvement to part time  making the reengineering effort more difficult 
having made the decision to exit the business  the remaining goodwill associated with the bioclear acquisition was not recoverable based on bioclear s lack of future undiscounted cash flows and was impaired 
once the impairment was determined  waterlink obtained an independent appraisal of the fair value of the bioclear business 
this appraisal indicated no value for the business above the identified tangible net assets 
as a result  waterlink wrote off the unamortized balance of goodwill of  since this was deemed to be a substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity  waterlink also wrote off  of the cumulative translation adjustment relating to bioclear s equity 
waterlink incurred special charges of  primarily attributable to contractual obligations to our former president and chief executive officer  who resigned in june  and costs necessary to recruit executives to waterlink 
waterlink incurred special charges of  for the year ended september  resulting primarily from the issuance at the time of our initial public offering of a ten year option to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share to an officer of waterlink pursuant to terms of an employment agreement 
of this amount  approximately  was non cash and the remainder represented cash obligations related principally to the reimbursement of income taxes resulting from the stock option issuance 
amortization 
amortization expense for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions previously described 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased borrowings related to the waterlink s ongoing acquisition program 
income taxes 
waterlink recorded an income tax provision of  on a pre tax loss of  waterlink was required to record income tax expense on earnings outside the united states and was also required to record income tax expense in several states domestically 
in addition  due to the net operating loss carryforward in the united states  we had to fully reserve for deferred tax assets that had been recorded in the previous year 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  waterlink s primary sources of liquidity have been borrowings available under credit facilities net proceeds from the sale of waterlink s common and preferred stock issuance of common stock and seller financing incurred in connection with waterlink s completed acquisitions cash flow from certain profitable acquisitions historically  waterlink s primary uses of capital have been the funding of its acquisition program working capital requirements including the funding for growth at certain acquisitions the funding required for certain under performing acquisitions waterlink does not currently anticipate making significant capital investments in plant and equipment because of our efforts to partner with vendors who manufacture most of the components used in our systems and equipment 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was  long term borrowings  along with  of proceeds from the sale of a building  were used to help fund purchases of equipment totaling  and cash outlays related to the purchases of businesses of in the fourth quarter of fiscal  waterlink s board of directors approved the plan 
the plan provided for costs associated with the exiting of certain facilities and employee termination costs 
costs associated with this plan totaled  during fiscal and  for the year ended september  waterlink also recorded special charges during fiscal related to the resignation of our chief executive officer who resigned in june in addition  waterlink recorded  of special charges during fiscal related to the announced retirement of our chairman of the board 
with regard to these special charges  approximately  remains reserved for future payment at september   which will be paid over the next two fiscal years 
waterlink is in the process of selling and disposing of non revenue producing assets 
a waterlink owned facility vacated during fiscal was sold and the proceeds of  were received during january waterlink is also in the process of selling our land  building and equipment in winnipeg  manitoba  canada  the former site of our bioclear manufacturing facility 
based on difficulties encountered during the sales process  waterlink further reduced the estimated net realizable value of these remaining assets held for sale by  to approximately  and recorded this change in accounting estimate during the year ended september  waterlink expects to sell  at approximately estimated net realizable value  the remaining assets of the bioclear manufacturing facility during fiscal during fiscal waterlink invested in aquatec water systems  incorporated  a designer and manufacturer of specialized multi chamber pumps for the pure water industry  in the form of two  subordinated notes  convertible into approximately of the equity of aquatec  together with other stock purchase options 
waterlink reached an agreement to sell both notes at their face value of  each plus interest to a group of investors 
waterlink received  as partial payment for the notes and anticipates receiving the balance of  during fiscal acquisitions 
waterlink s current capital structure does not support an aggressive acquisition program 
waterlink s intends to improve its capital structure through a combination of improved operating performance and access to capital markets  which we expect will enable us to resume our acquisition program 
acquisitions are expected to play a strategic role in waterlink s future to increase competitiveness  spur revenue and earnings growth  and enhance our total solutions capability 
the timing  size and success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable at this time 
as a result of the specialty products division acquisition and the implementation of our plan  our debt is in excess of our stockholders equity and we bear the risks associated with increased leverage 
during the year ended september  waterlink made additional purchase consideration payments of  related to the achievement of targeted operating results of two of our acquisitions 
in addition  additional purchase consideration of  in connection with one of waterlink s acquisitions had been earned and recorded as of september   and was paid in october  these amounts have been recorded as additional goodwill 
under the terms of certain of the purchase agreements  waterlink may be required to make additional purchase consideration payments of up to  contingent upon the achievement of specified operating results during fiscal any additional purchase consideration payments will be treated as additional goodwill for accounting purposes 
credit availability 
waterlink s credit facilities are comprised of a  domestic facility with bank of america national trust savings association as agent  which expires on may  and separate facilities aggregating approximately  at three of its overseas subsidiaries 
the credit facilities will be utilized to primarily fund operating activities of waterlink and  to a lesser extent  fund future acquisitions 
prior to the amendment mentioned below   of borrowings was made available to waterlink as the result of third party guarantees 
in connection with assisting in the process of improving our capital structure  these third party guarantees were provided by brantley venture partners iii  lp in the amount of  and by the three executive officers of waterlink totaling waterlink granted the guarantors warrants to purchase  in the aggregate  up to  shares of waterlink common stock at an exercise price of 
per share 
of the  warrants   were issued at the time the guarantees were issued and the remaining  warrants were issued on september   the date of shareholder approval for the remaining warrants 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire if unexercised in five years 
the number of warrants granted to each guarantor was based on their proportionate share of the  in guarantees 
effective with the sale of  shares of waterlink common stock at per share on october   waterlink entered into an amendment of our domestic facility waiving certain financial covenants that were not satisfied at september  the waiver remains effective until december   assuming waterlink realizes not less than  of operating income for each of the months of october  november and december at december  waterlink will be required to be in compliance with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis as defined in the amendment 
the net proceeds from the sale of common stock were used to repay a portion of the domestic credit facility 
after giving effect to the repayment  availability for future borrowings upon effectiveness of the amendment under the credit facilities is approximately  availability for future borrowings may increase or decrease based on the pro forma operating performance of waterlink 
loans under the credit facilities bear interest at a designated variable base rate plus spreads ranging from to basis points depending on a leverage ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to waterlink s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at waterlink s option  the credit facilities bear interest based on a designated london interbank offering rate  or libor  plus spreads ranging from to basis points  depending on waterlink s leverage ratio 
the credit facilities restrict or prohibit waterlink from taking many actions  including paying dividends and incurring or assuming other indebtedness or liens 
the banks that participate in the credit facilities also must approve most acquisitions 
waterlink s obligations under the credit facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of waterlink s domestic assets  including equipment  inventory  accounts receivable and general intangibles and the pledge of most of the stock of waterlink s subsidiaries 
waterlink has guaranteed the payment by our three overseas subsidiaries of their obligations under the overseas facilities 
the three overseas subsidiaries have given the lenders an assurance that the subsidiaries would not pledge their assets to any other party 
waterlink also has in place a  credit facility with royal bank of canada to fund canadian working capital requirements including banker s acceptances and letters of credit 
interest rates are negotiated on an individual borrowing basis and are related to the royal bank of canada s prime rate 
at september  the canadian credit facility was fully utilized 
borrowings under the canadian credit facility are payable upon demand and are guaranteed by the real and personal property of waterlink s bioclear facility 
waterlink believes that through the end of fiscal  sufficient funds for our working capital needs  additional cash requirements of the plan and other special charges and additional contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions will be provided by future cash flow from operations borrowings under its credit facilities issuance of subordinated indebtedness  common stock  preferred stock and seller financing incurred in connection with future financings or acquisitions the sale of certain non revenue producing assets market risk 
waterlink s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates charged on our domestic facility 
if the market rates for borrowings increased by on our domestic facility  the impact would be an increase to interest expense of  with a corresponding decrease to income before income taxes 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the balance of waterlink s domestic facility at september   after giving effect to the  of net proceeds generated by the sale of  shares of common stock on october   as well as the payment of the  notes payable to the former shareholders of meva that occurred on october  this analysis does not consider the effects of the overall economic environment associated with such a change nor does it assume any change to waterlink s current financial structure 
during fiscal waterlink entered into an interest rate swap agreement to modify the characteristics of the domestic facility  which fixed waterlink s libor based rate at on a notional amount of  on september  this agreement was sold for a nominal gain 
waterlink also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related primarily to the purchases of inventory and the collection of accounts receivable 
waterlink continues to utilize a limited number of foreign exchange instruments  primarily forward contracts  to manage this exposure 
waterlink had no significant hedging contracts outstanding at september  year the year issue  as widely reported  could cause malfunctions in certain computer related applications with respect to dates on or after january  these malfunctions could relate to information technology  it  or non it environments 
due to waterlink s decentralized it environments  individual assessments  in accordance with waterlink s year program  have been conducted at waterlink s operating companies 
collectively  these assessments indicate that waterlink s exposure to this segment of the year issue is not significant as waterlink does not extensively rely on it systems which require modification 
waterlink s externally developed system issues have been assessed company wide through inquiry of external vendors and testing procedures where necessary 
the appropriate upgrades  if required  have been or are scheduled to be attained in order to make these systems year compliant 
waterlink has tested internally developed software systems where applicable and has developed programs to make these systems year compliant 
testing of upgraded or modified systems has begun at waterlink s various operating units 
results of these testing procedures  which will be completed by december   are incomplete 
the year program also addresses issues related to non it environments 
collectively  these assessments indicate that waterlink s exposure to this segment of the year issue is not significant due to waterlink s limited manufacturing operations and related capital equipment needs 
waterlink s operating equipment has been assessed through inquiry of external manufacturers and internal testing procedures 
remediation efforts have begun where necessary 
collectively  waterlink will complete and test remediated assets by december  waterlink s primary system interface with an external party involves its banking institutions 
based on inquiries of its banking institutions  waterlink is not aware of any unresolved year issues 
further  due to waterlink s decentralized operations  individual assessments  in accordance with waterlink s year program  have been conducted at waterlink s operating companies regarding significant suppliers and subcontractors 
these assessments  which are not complete  have been executed primarily through inquiry of our various suppliers and subcontractors 
to date  waterlink is not aware of any external party with an unresolved year issue that would materially impact waterlink s operations and financial position 
however  waterlink has no means of ensuring that external parties will be year compliant 
the inability of external parties to resolve their year issue in a timely manner could impact waterlink s operations and financial position 
the effect of non compliance by external parties is not determinable 
waterlink has primarily utilized internal resources to assess  test  remediate and implement software and equipment related to the year the total cost of our year program  excluding employee salaries  is estimated at  primarily attributable to software upgrades and modifications 
waterlink has incurred approximately  related to the various phases of its year program through september  we believe that we have a program established to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
waterlink s year program has not been completed 
in the event waterlink does not complete its remaining year procedures  we believe under a worst case scenario  certain functions may be interrupted 
waterlink does not have a formal contingency plan established if all phases of its year program are not completed 
however  appropriate actions  such as interim manual information systems  will be instituted to mitigate such interruption 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from unresolved year issues could also materially adversely affect waterlink 
the potential liability and loss of revenue from these issues is not determinable 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
the statement will require  among other things  that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which makes sfas no 
effective for waterlink beginning october  waterlink does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
forward looking statements with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed in this report may include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
while forward looking statements are sometimes presented with numerical specificity  they are based on variety of assumptions made by management regarding future circumstances over which waterlink has little or no control 
a number of important factors  including those identified in this section as well as factors discussed elsewhere herein  could cause waterlink s actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements or financial information 
actual results may differ from forward looking results for a number of reasons  including the following changes in world economic conditions  including i 
instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which waterlink conducts business ii 
significant changes in currency valuations iii 
recessionary environments iv 
year compliance issues relating to waterlink s programs and external parties  including suppliers and customers v 
the effects of military conflicts changes in customer demand and timing of orders as they affect sales and product mix  including i 
the effect of strikes at customer s facilities ii 
variations in backlog iii 
the impact of changes in industry business cycles iv 
changes in environmental laws competitive factors  including i 
changes in market penetration ii 
introduction of new products by existing and new competitors changes in operating costs  including i 
changes in waterlink s and its subcontractors manufacturing processes ii 
changes in costs associated with varying levels of operations iii 
changes resulting from different levels of customers demands iv 
effects of unplanned work stoppages v 
changes in cost of labor and benefits vi 
the cost and availability of raw materials and energy the degree of success of waterlink s strategic plan unanticipated litigation  claims or assessments our quarterly results of operations could fluctuate significantly which could result in defaults under our bank credit agreement and in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we need to finalize complicated contracts and orders with our customers before we produce our revenues 
often  the timing of those contracts and orders is also subject to our customers receiving financing  various permits and other aspects outside our control 
a delay in finalizing any of these contracts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results in any fiscal quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not necessarily be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
since some of our financial covenants in our bank credit agreement are based on quarterly results  these fluctuations could result in our needing to negotiate amended terms or being in default of our bank credit agreement 
also  these fluctuations in our quarterly results could lead to our failure to meet expectations of securities analysts and investors and could seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
our substantial amount of debt could limit our growth and imposes restrictions on our business 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness 
our level of debt and our recent operating performance  including the impact of special charges to our income  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our strategy  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  use operating cash flow in other areas of our business since we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to pay interest and retire debt  and react to changing market conditions and economic downturns 
at september   our total indebtedness was  on october   waterlink sold  shares of common stock in a registered offering at a price of per share  which resulted in the aggregate net proceeds of approximately  after the repayment of a portion of this debt from the sale of  shares of common stock  this total indebtedness is reduced to  our debt agreements contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our discretion which respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place significant restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  both under the bank credit agreement and other debt agreements  merge or consolidate with other entities  make acquisitions  repay our obligations  and pay dividends and other distributions 
we have a limited combined operating history and are still in the process of integrating those acquisitions that we have completed 
we were formed in december and have grown principally through the acquisition of existing businesses 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to integrate the operations of our various businesses  including centralizing some functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation in the sharing of opportunities and resources among our businesses 
our plan and our restructured organization are intended to continue to promote our ongoing integration process 
our management group has been assembled for only a relatively short time with several key managers  sales and engineering personnel joining us within the last two fiscal years 
the demand for our products is cyclical 
much of our water purification and wastewater equipment requires significant capital expenditures by our customers 
as such  the timing of customer purchases from us is affected by various economic factors  including interest rate and business cycle fluctuations  the timing and process of government funding and the setting of rates by regulators  all of which are beyond our control 
the cyclical nature of capital equipment sales could have an adverse affect on our revenues and profitability in general and on our revenues and profitability in any particular quarterly financial reporting period 
our industry is highly competitive 
our industry  the water purification and wastewater treatment industry  is fragmented and highly competitive due to the large number of businesses within certain product areas 
we compete with many companies  several of which have greater market penetration  depth of product line  resources and access to capital  which could be competitive advantages in securing projects 
while we believe we are well positioned to deliver technology and services at a fair price  some of our competitors have developed product and service integration capabilities beyond our current scope 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our business depends on our ability to hire and retain our executive officers and senior management 
our business could be adversely affected if for any reason any of our executive officers or senior managers cease to be employed by us 
in addition  we will be dependent on the senior managers of any significant businesses we may acquire in the future and on our ability to attract and retain qualified managers to support our internal expansion 
the current members of our board of directors and management own approximately of our common stock and can exercise significant influence over our affairs 
also  several institutional investors own substantial percentages of our common stock 
at october   our current directors and management own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of our common stock 
in addition  several large institutional investors own or control a significant percentage of our common stock 
accordingly  these individuals and institutional investors  if acting together or even alone  can exercise significant influence over our affairs including the election of our directors  appointment of our management and approval of actions requiring the approval of our stockholders  which may include the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation  the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all our assets  and similar items 
the concentration of voting power of these stockholders  if they act together  could  under certain circumstances  have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of waterlink 
our foreign operations are subject to political and economic risks and we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuation 
we sell a substantial proportion of our systems  equipment and services in western europe  latin america and other regions outside the united states 
also  a number of our divisions operate outside of the united states 
our net sales outside the united states were approximately of our net sales for the year ended september  political  economic  regulatory and social conditions in foreign countries in which we operate may change 
risks associated with sales and operations in foreign countries include risks of war expropriation or nationalization of assets renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts changing political conditions changing laws and policies affecting trade  taxation and investment overlap of different tax structures the general hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted because our reporting currency is the united states dollar  our operations outside the united states sometimes face the additional risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
we are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate charges on our reporting for results from those operations in our financial statements 
we may be subject to liability under environmental laws 
in the united states  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  and comparable state laws  impose liability without fault for the releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
potentially responsible parties include a owners and operators of a site  b parties which create the hazardous substances released at a site  and c parties which arrange for the transportation or disposal of hazardous substances 
we could face claims by governmental authorities  private individuals and other persons alleging that hazardous substances were released during the treatment process or from the use or disposal of end products and by products of the treatment process in violation of law 
we are also subject to environmental laws in countries outside the united states where we operate or in which our customers are located 
these requirements and their enforcement may vary by country but in general prescribe standards for the protection of human health  safety and the environment 
changes in environmental laws could affect our business 
federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations impose substantial standards for properly purifying water and treating wastewater  and impose liabilities for noncompliance 
environmental laws and regulations are  and will continue to be  a significant factor affecting our ability to sell our solutions  systems and equipment 
to the extent that demand for our solutions  systems and equipment is created by the need to comply with environmental laws and regulations  any modification of the standards imposed by these laws and environmental laws and regulations may reduce demand for our products and services  thereby adversely affecting our business and prospects 
our long term growth strategy is dependent on completing acquisitions 
over the long term  we intend to grow significantly by acquiring other businesses 
our current capital structure does not support an aggressive acquisition program 
we intend to use a combination of our common stock  cash and debt obligations to make these future acquisitions 
the extent to which we are able to use our common stock for this purpose will depend on its market value from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment 
to the extent we are unable to use our common stock to make acquisitions  our ability to grow may be limited to funds from internally generated cash flow over and above our other cash needs and our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
our current capital structure may make it more difficult for us to borrow money to use for acquisitions 
an acquisition strategy such as ours involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses and profitability of acquisition candidates 
historically  we have been successful in identifying potential acquisition candidates 
as consolidation continues in the industry  the prices for attractive acquisition candidates may be higher than we have paid and may make an acquisition strategy for growth less viable 
our business is subject to potential warranty and performance guarantee claims 
some of our customers require us to guarantee that our services and products will be of a specified level of quality or performance 
if a product or service fails to attain that level of quality or performance  we could incur significant financial penalties 
we face many unknown risks associated with year problems 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are dependant upon internal calendars coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish dates after the beginning of year from those before 
while we believe that we have a program established to resolve the year issue in a timely manner in our computer systems  we may not have resolved all issues 
also  we depend on third parties  including suppliers  subcontractors and customers  for the operation of our day to day business 
if they fail to correct their year problems  failures or interruptions to our business may occur  resulting in significant financial and other problems
