item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee and the managing director  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see item  legal proceedings  and note to financial statements contained herein 
the trust has no means of assuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which  with sales volumes  form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the deutsche mark dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
the trust has conducted an internal review of its readiness for year yk computer compliance issues and has communicated with its principal business relationships concerning their respective yk computer readiness as well 
based on this review and the inquiries to third parties  management of the trust believes that its level of readiness will be adequate in a timely manner and will not adversely impact on the continued ability of the trust to manage its affairs 
the trust s internal technology system is limited to stand alone personal computers 
they have been examined with respect to hardware and software issues and are already compliant  at an estimated direct cost to the trust of  inquiries have also been made to the principal third parties with which the trust s business is conducted 
these include beb and mobil  the german operating companies  the bank of new york and deutsche bank  the trust s principal banks  and registrar and transfer company  the trust s transfer agent 
all of these third party entities have confirmed that they have in place substantial management personnel devoted to the yk compliance requirements and have instituted comprehensive testing and remediation programs to complete necessary compliance efforts in a timely manner 
the trust has not made any direct inquiries to vendors to the operating companies or to other parties with important relationships with the operating companies and has relied on their compliance review programs for that purpose 
these are reported to be in place to effect timely compliance in a manner which will avoid any disruption of the activities of the operating companies  but the trust has no direct information concerning such other parties 
to the extent that the trust relies on statistical and other information and analysis from its consultant in germany and its consulting organization  davis associates  the trust has been advised that computer program and hardware review will be completed to assure yk compliance not later than the second half of no costs to the trust are anticipated in connection with these matters 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  increased over the amount for the prior year 
this increase in royalty income  along with higher interest income and lower expenses  resulted in a increase in net trust income to  increases in gas sales offset the effects both of lower gas prices and lower exchange rates throughout the year 
increases in overall gas sales and in gas sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg more than offset the negative impact of lower gas prices and weaker exchange rates 
overall gas sales from the oldenburg concession increased by from billion cubic feet bcf to bcf 
gas sales from western oldenburg increased from bcf to bcf 
in the last three years  gas sales from western oldenburg as a percentage of total oldenburg gas sales have increased from in to in and in excluding the effects of differences in prices and applicable exchange rates  the impact of the higher royalty rate from western oldenburg is shown in the table on page which details royalty income by geographic area 
while accounting for approximately of overall gas sales  dollar royalties from the sale of gas from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg are nearly seven times higher than royalties from eastern oldenburg 
the average yearly price for gas under both the higher and lower royalty agreements declined by and respectively to and pfennigs per kwh 
reflecting the continued pressure of lower oil prices on the international market  gas prices were lower or unchanged in all but the first quarter of fiscal when converted into more familiar terms using the year s average exchange rate  gas prices were and per mcf under the higher and lower royalty agreements 
with oldenburg gas sales accounting for nearly of the trust s royalties  non gas or non oldenburg royalties have a very minor and declining impact on the trust s revenues 
royalties from sulfur  reflecting the continued exclusion of mobil s sulfur royalty obligation and the low worldwide sulfur prices  amounted to only  royalties from oil amounted to  and continued to decline  reflecting the increasingly uneconomical nature of oil production in germany and the continuing capping of these oil wells 
non oldenburg royalties amounted to only  the operating companies  responding to acknowledging the declining income from these areas  have suspended production in all non oldenburg areas other than grosses meer 
these areas will be further evaluated by the operating companies to determine whether they warrant further investment and exploration 
trust expenses for fiscal of  declined from the prior year reflecting reduced general trust expenses 
interest income increased to a total of  from the prior year reflecting larger sums available for investment from royalty revenues 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional and trust units were issued and  and were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
management continues to believe that the number of such presentations will continue to be minimal in the coming years 
in all events  after the year  pursuant to the provisions of the order of the delaware court of chancery of april   no further liability for payment of dividends or distributions arrears will be required 
see note to financial statements contained herein for further information 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  increased from the prior year 
a combination of higher gas prices  relatively uninterrupted gas production permitting increased overall gas sales  and increased gas sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg resulted in the higher royalty revenue 
this higher level of royalties occurred despite the decline in the average yearly value of the deutsche mark from to 
the average yearly price for gas under both the higher and lower royalty agreements increased by and respectively to and pfennigs per kwh 
compared to the prior year s quarterly averages  higher average gas prices occurred in each of the four quarters 
when converted into more familiar terms using the year s average exchange rate  gas prices were and per mcf under the higher and lower royalty agreements 
following the repairs to the gas pipeline and renovations of the grossenkneten desulfurization plant in the late summer of  gas production increased to its full capacity of  cubic meters per hour 
the resumption of full production allowed the operating companies to sell more than billion cubic feet bcf of gas from the entire oldenburg concession  an increase of from the prior year s sales 
the expansion of the desulfurization plant s capacity also permitted an increase in the relative volumes of gas drawn from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg 
gas sales from western oldenburg increased to more than bcf 
in addition  the percentage of western gas production to overall gas production increased from in to in without considering differences in prices  the impact of the higher royalty rate from western oldenburg is shown in the table on page detailing royalty income by geographic area 
despite accounting for less than of overall gas production  royalties from the sale of gas from western oldenburg are more than six times higher than royalties from eastern oldenburg 
with oldenburg gas sales accounting for over of the trust s royalties  non gas or non oldenburg royalties have a very minor impact on the trust 
royalties from sulfur  reflecting the continued exclusion of mobil s sulfur royalty obligation  amounted to only  royalties from oil amounted to  and continued to decline  reflecting the increasingly uneconomical nature of oil production in germany and the continuing capping of these uneconomical oil wells 
non oldenburg royalties amounted to only  trust expenses for fiscal of  declined by from the prior year 
slightly higher interest rates along with larger sums available for investment resulted in a increase in interest income to during fiscal and respectively  an additional and  trust units were issued and and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
in addition on april   pursuant to the settlement approved by the order of the delaware court of chancery  the trust issued  units to the delaware state escheator 
the increase in the number of issued units resulted in a dilution reducing subsequent per unit income by that percentage 
beyond the dilution from this and future issuances of units  the order will have no impact on the trust s financial condition  result of operations or long or short term liquidity 
the termination of liability for payment of arrears of dividends or distributions after the year as specified in the order of the delaware court of chancery is expected to benefit the trust s financial condition
