diluted eps requires an adjustment to the denominator to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued 
the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after tax amount of interest recognized with any convertible debt 
as the company reported net losses in and  inclusion of potential common shares would have an antidilutive effect on per share amounts

i bans development of new gold and silver mines and expansions to existing mines which use open pit mining and cyanide in the treatment and recovery process 
for most of the campaign period  mining companies were prevented from campaigning due to a previously passed initiative i which prohibited campaign expenditures by for profit entities 
ten days prior to the election  a federal judge declared the prohibition unconstitutional 
the mining community has filed lawsuits against i  based on i having been denied the opportunity to campaign due to the effectiveness of i until the last few days  and ii due process considerations  in that i results in a taking of property without any compelling public policy interest  since environmental safety concerns are well protected and monitored with existing laws and regulations

environmental regulation in the montana state legislature passed legislation which streamlined the permitting process of new industrial projects by reorganizing the several state agencies that had jurisdiction over environmental permitting into one new central agency  the department of environmental quality deq 
this agency will be responsible for acting on an application for a hard rock mining operating permit in connection with a plan of operations filed by the seven up pete joint venture for the mcdonald gold project 
this permit  as well as several other local  state and federal permits  including a joint state and federal environmental impact statement eis  will be required before permits can be issued

moreover  with the passage of i in november   the company cannot presently proceed with permitting and development of the mcdonald gold project 
the kendall mine operates under permits granted by the deq 
the deq requires the company to maintain a  reclamation bond to ensure appropriate reclamation

the company s estimate to achieve final mine closure may be impacted by the outcome of these pending matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices the company s earnings and cash flow are significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold 
gold prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  such as demand  production levels  economic policies of central banks  and producer hedging 
during the last five years  the average annual market price has fluctuated between per ounce and per ounce 
moreover  in late and early  gold prices declined to their lowest level in eighteen years 
the company currently utilizes two types of commodity instruments to protect the selling price of a portion of its anticipated production 
at december   approximately of the recoverable reserves at the company s briggs mine was hedged through i short dated forward contracts totaling  ounces at an average price of approximately per ounce  and ii a commodity based loan totaling  ounces at a monetized price of per ounce 
with regard to the forward contracts  the company can selectively extend maturity dates and has the opportunity to deliver all of its estimated gold production not otherwise reserved for its commodity loan repayment at prices that exceed the current market price of gold by an average of approximately per ounce 
however  for purposes of illustrating the potential impact of a change in gold price on the company s annual profitability and cash flow  if only of its estimated production was delivered against the forward contracts and the commodity loan  a change in the price of gold would have an impact of approximately million 
similarly  a hedge position of only with a change in the price of gold would impact the company s profitability and cash flow by approximately million 
the company s commodity based loan was established in december   by borrowing  ounces from certain counterparties  selling the ounces in the marketplace at a price of per ounce  and using the proceeds of million to develop and construct production facilities at the briggs mine 
see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the financing arrangements for the briggs mine 
as the gold is repaid from production at the briggs mine  the company records revenue at the monetized amount of with a corresponding reduction in debt 
an implicit hedging gain or loss exists at the time of repayment depending on whether the market price of gold at the repayment date is below or above the monetized amount 
there are certain market risks associated with commodity instruments 
if the company s counterparties fail to honor their contractual obligation to purchase gold at agreed upon prices  the company may be exposed to market price risk by having to sell gold in the open market at prevailing prices 
similarly  if the company fails to produce sufficient quantities of gold to meet its forward commitments and commodity loan obligation  the company would have to purchase the shortfall in the open market at prevailing prices 
in may  the company liquidated a forward position that was originally established in december   resulting in proceeds of million 
for the year ended december   million of the gain was recognized in operations based on the original terms of the forward contracts 
during  million of the gain will be recognized with the balance of million recognized in at december   the mark to market value of the company s forward contracts was approximately million 
the fair value and carrying value of the company s commodity based loan at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
interest rates at december   the company s debt consisted of a commodity based gold loan 
interest rates for such loans are typically lower than dollar denominated debt  as the cost of leasing gold from sources such as central banks is relatively inexpensive less than per annum 
a counterparty to a commodity based loan will add an applicable margin to its cost of funds for purposes of establishing an interest rate to the producer 
during   and  the interest rate on the company s gold loan averaged   and  respectively 
the company is required to have the rate periodically reset for periods that it may choose which range in duration from one to six months 
because of the historically low rates for gold denominated debt  the company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk  as a change in the rate from to would have an impact on annual earnings and cash flow of less than million  based on the outstanding loan amount of  ounces and current gold prices of approximately per ounce 
foreign currency the price of gold is denominated in us dollars  and the company s gold production operations are in the united states 
the company conducts only a minor amount of exploration activity in foreign countries and has minimal foreign currency exposure
