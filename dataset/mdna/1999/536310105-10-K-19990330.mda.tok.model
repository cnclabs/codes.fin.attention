part i item l 
business overview business strategy the liposome company  inc together with its subsidiaries  the company is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development  manufacturing and marketing of proprietary lipid and liposome based pharmaceuticals  primarily for the treatment of cancer and other related life threatening illnesses 
organized in  the company s marketed product and products in development are based on its knowledge and understanding of lipids  the substances that comprise the membrane of all living cells 
the products developed by the company with this technology include drug delivery vehicles and novel pharmaceuticals utilizing modulated cell signaling and bio active lipids 
to supplement and expand its internal discovery capabilities  the company may in license pharmaceutical compounds for further development  manufacturing and marketing 
abelcet amphotericin b lipid complex injection  the company s first commercialized product  has been approved for marketing for certain indications in the united states and foreign markets and is the subject of marketing application filings in several other countries 
in the united states  abelcet has been cleared for marketing for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of conventional amphotericin b therapy 
international approvals have been received for primary and or refractory treatment of these infections 
currently all product revenues are derived from abelcet 
during  the company marketed abelcet in the us  canada and the united kingdom with its own sales force 
for other countries  the company s general strategy is to market abelcet through marketing alliances 
specific marketing alliances are determined on a country by country basis 
in addition  sales are realized on a named patient basis in certain countries where marketing approvals have not yet been received 
the company is developing evacet formerly tlc d  liposomal doxorubicin  as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer and potentially other cancers 
three phase iii clinical studies of evacet have been completed by the company 
the company filed an nda in the us in december  and plans to file in for approval to market evacet in europe 
the company also plans to conduct additional studies of evacet in combination with other anticancer agents 
tlc ell  a liposomal ether lipid  potentially provides advantages over existing chemotherapeutic agents 
ether lipid has been shown in previous human studies to be an effective anticancer agent  but was highly toxic to red blood cells 
tlc ell does not appear to have this toxicity 
more importantly  unlike most chemotherapeutic agents  it does not interact with dna 
ell has not caused bone marrow suppression in animal studies and is not likely to be carcinogenic or mutagenic in its own right 
if this holds true in humans  tlc ell would be a significant advance in cancer chemotherapy 
tlc ell entered phase i clinical trials at duke university medical center in february the company has a continuing discovery research program concentrating on oncology treatment and has a number of products in research 
these products include bromotaxol a hydrophobic derivative of paclitaxel  which has shown anticancer activity in several experimental models  ceramides and sphingosines molecules widely implicated in cell differentiation and apoptosis  certain of which the company has identified as displaying anticancer activity  and fusogenic liposomes liposomes specifically designed to fuse to cell membranes  which the company hopes to use for the efficient delivery of genes to their intended targets 
on june  the company announced results of a phase iii study of ventus as the treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome  an inflammatory condition affecting the lungs 
the company s analysis of the two arms of the study showed no significant difference between patients receiving ventus or placebo either in reducing the time on mechanical ventilation or in day mortality 
no safety concerns for the drug were identified 
the company does not intend to perform any further significant development of ventus for this indication 
following the results of the ventus study  the company announced its intention to focus its resources on the development of an oncology franchise 
as part of implementing this strategy  the company restructured its operations to reflect ongoing operating realities and to focus the organization on the development and marketing of oncology and related pharmaceuticals 
the restructuring eliminated positions  which resulted in unusual charges of  in the second quarter of additionally  in order to gain operational access to a second  potentially significant oncology related drug  the company reacquired  on july   all development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacet from pfizer inc pfizer  which had previously been co developing evacet with the company 
the company assumed control over and the cost of all clinical studies  including the ongoing phase iii clinical studies that were previously being conducted by pfizer 
pfizer will receive royalties on worldwide except japan commercial sales of evacet 
in july and august  the company entered into agreements to settle patent litigation with the university of texas and md anderson cancer center ut and with nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc nexstar and fujisawa usa  inc under the ut settlement  the company received an exclusive license under ut s patent and paid past royalties in a combination of cash and stock  agreed to pay royalties on future sales of abelcet  and issued to ut a ten year warrant to purchase million shares of the company s common stock at per share 
pursuant to the nexstar settlement  the company received a payment of  in and began receiving quarterly payments based on nexstar s worldwide sales of ambisome beginning in product development the following table summarizes the principal product development activities of the company product prog use status marketing ram rights anti infective and cancer abelcet united states systemic fungal marketing and the company infections in sales patients refractory to  or intolerant of  amphotericin b

preclinical testing denotes work to refine product performance characteristics and studies relating to product composition  stability  scale up  toxicity and efficacy to create a prototype formulation in preparation for the filing of an ind application with the fda for authority to commence testing in humans clinical studies 
phase i iii clinical studies denote safety and efficacy tests in human patients in accordance with fda guidelines as follows phase i dosage and tolerance studies 
phase ii detailed evaluations of safety and efficacy 
phase iii larger scale evaluation of safety and efficacy potentially requiring larger patient numbers  depending on the clinical indication for which marketing approval is sought 
see governmental regulation 
technology the company s products are based on its proprietary knowledge of lipid technology to employ liposomes or lipid complexes as a vehicle to deliver an active therapeutic ingredient  or in the case of bioactive lipids  to develop novel therapeutics based on lipids that are biologically active 
liposomes are microscopic man made spheres composed of lipids that can be engineered to entrap drugs or other biologically active molecules 
a lipid complex is an organized assembly of phospholipids whereby an active pharmaceutical is interspersed and tightly bound to adjoining lipid molecules 
in many cases  lipid complexed and liposomal pharmaceuticals can provide less toxicity and or better efficacy than might otherwise result from the underlying active ingredient 
lipid technology is extremely broad and offers numbers of opportunities for the development of new therapeutics 
recent advances in the understanding of the biological roles of lipids suggest that  in addition to forming a protective barrier enabling cells to live  they also serve other purposes  such as communicating information that originates in the external environment to the internal chemistry of the cell 
based on these discoveries  scientists at the company believe that lipids or lipid derivatives are likely to play a pivotal role in modulating cellular chemistry and hence cell function 
the research now underway at the company is based on these new understandings of the role of lipids 
this role has profound pharmacological implications  ie  that lipids themselves can be biologically active and therapeutically useful 
products abelcet amphotericin b lipid complex injection abelcet amphotericin b lipid complex injection has been developed for the treatment of systemic fungal infections such as candidiasis  aspergillosis and cryptococcal meningitis occurring primarily in immunocompromised patients such as cancer chemotherapy patients  organ and bone marrow transplant recipients and people with aids 
amphotericin b  the active ingredient in abelcet  is a broad spectrum anti fungal agent that is believed to act by penetrating the cell wall of a fungus  thereby killing it 
in its conventional form  amphotericin b is particularly toxic to the kidneys  an adverse effect that often restricts the amount that can be administered to a patient 
while still a nephrotoxic drug  abelcet is able to deliver much greater amounts of amphotericin b while significantly reducing the kidney toxicity associated with the conventional drug 
abelcet has received regulatory marketing approval in the united states and twenty two international markets including france  italy  the united kingdom  canada and spain 
marketing applications are in various stages of review in several additional countries 
systemic fungal infections are a major threat to those patients whose immune systems are compromised 
the company is marketing abelcet in the united states for the treatment of these infections in patients who have failed on or who are intolerant of conventional amphotericin b 
in france and certain other countries abelcet is marketed as a second line treatment for certain severe systemic fungal infections 
in italy  spain  the united kingdom and other countries  abelcet has also been approved as a primary first line therapy for certain fungal infections 
in may  the company filed a new drug application nda for abelcet with the united states food and drug administration fda 
following a priority review  the product was cleared for marketing in november for the treatment of aspergillosis in patients who have failed on  or who are intolerant of  amphotericin b 
the company commenced shipments of abelcet in the us in december in october  following a second priority review  the fda cleared for marketing an expanded label for abelcet to include the treatment of all fungal infections in patients who have failed on  or who are intolerant of  amphotericin b 
in february  the company received its first approval to market abelcet from the medicines control agency of the united kingdom 
abelcet was approved in spain in late and in certain smaller countries during during the latter part of and the beginning of  the company received approvals to market abelcet in italy  austria  spain  france  switzerland  canada  norway and hong kong 
in september  the company received approval to market abelcet in australia 
the company believes it may receive marketing approvals in additional countries during and in later years 
evacet liposomal doxorubicin the company is developing evacet  liposomal doxorubicin formerly tlc d  as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer 
doxorubicin  one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs  is used in the treatment of many solid tumors  leukemias and lymphomas 
a substantial portion of the usage of doxorubicin is believed to be for the treatment of breast cancer  and about of the us usage is believed to be for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer 
however  doxorubicin  in addition to the acute toxicities typical of chemotherapeutic drugs  can cause irreversible cardiac damage which is often the cumulative dose limiting factor for such anthracycline anticancer chemotherapeutic agents 
the individual maximum dosage given to a patient is limited by these and other toxic side effects 
evacet  a liposomal formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin  is designed to reduce significantly the cardiotoxic activity of the parent drug ie doxorubicin while maintaining efficacy 
three phase iii trials have been conducted by the company a single agent trial n in which evacet was compared directly to doxorubicin  a combination trial n in which evacet was compared to doxorubicin when each was administered in combination with cyclophosphamide  and a european combination trial n in which evacet was compared to epirubicin  an anthracycline therapy widely used in europe  when each was administered in combination with cyclophosphamide 
in december  the company filed an nda with the fda for marketing clearance for evacet as a first line treatment for metastatic breast cancer 
in february  the fda notified the company that it had accepted its application for review 
the company expects the fda to complete its review by the latter part of there can be no assurance that the company will receive marketing clearance from the fda to market evacet in the united states 
the company reacquired all development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacet from pfizer in july pfizer had previously been co developing evacet with the company 
the company assumed control over and the cost of all clinical studies including the ongoing phase iii clinical studies noted above that were previously being conducted and funded by pfizer 
pfizer was also reimbursing the company for substantially all of the development costs of evacet that were being incurred by the company 
pfizer made available a credit line of up to million to continue the development of evacet  and to the extent that any funding is actually used by the company  the outstanding principal and interest would be repayable on the earlier of days after fda clearance to market evacettm or in twenty quarterly installments commencing july  pfizer is entitled to receive royalties on worldwide except japan commercial sales of evacet 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at the end of tlc ell liposomal ether lipid the company is developing tlc ell a liposomal ether lipid  a new cancer therapeutic that may have applications for the treatment of many different cancers including prostate cancer and non small cell lung carcinoma 
tlc ell is believed to employ a different mechanism of action than conventional anticancer agents  it does not interact directly with dna and is not myelosuppressive 
thus  it may complement many standard chemotherapeutic agents 
in preclinical studies conducted by the company s scientists  tlc ell has been shown to be active in tumor models of melanoma  lung cancer  leukemia and multiple drug resistant cell lines 
additionally  it has been shown to be active in a model of human prostate cancer 
ether lipids are called such because their chemical construction includes an ether bond 
they have been shown to be active against human tumors but have toxic side effects at therapeutic doses that severely limit their use as a human therapeutic agent 
tlc ell is a liposomal form of ether lipid 
in animal models it has been shown to be significantly more potent than non liposome encapsulated ether lipid and  at putative therapeutic doses  has not demonstrated any toxicities 
its mechanism of action is believed to involve the modulation of signal transduction processes without direct interaction with dna 
it may be for this reason that in animal studies tlc ell has been shown not to possess many of the toxicities  particularly myelosuppression  that are seen with many other cancer drugs 
the company commenced phase i clinical trials of tlc ell in february at duke university medical center 
research programs bromotaxol bromotaxol a hydrophobic derivative of paclitaxel has shown anticancer activity in several experimental models 
in a model of a human ovarian cancer tumor  mice treated with bromotaxol have remained tumor free for extended periods of time 
if initial research data is confirmed  the company expects to enter a hydrophobic taxane derivative  into a formal development program in  leading to the possible commencement of human clinical studies in ceramides and sphingosines ceramides and sphingosines are molecules widely implicated in cell differentiation and apoptosis 
the company has identified and developed a family of such molecules displaying anticancer activity 
in vitro  they have been shown to be active against several human cancers including non small cell lung  breast  renal cell  ovarian and colon cancer  as well as against drug resistant cell lines 
one compound thus far apparently has activity against a multiple drug resistant tumor in vivo 
the company is conducting research to identify molecules within this family that could be attractive product candidates 
gene therapy the company is conducting research to discover a means for efficiently delivering genes to their intended targets 
company researchers have successfully put dna into liposomes and have achieved fusion of these liposomes to cells  thereby accomplishing the direct delivery of the liposome contents into the cell interior 
company scientists have also succeeded in protecting these liposomes from degradation and are able to modulate their circulation time 
the research team is now attempting to develop systems to target these fusogenic liposomes to particular cell types 
research costs during  and  the company s research and development costs were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that any of the products described above  or resulting from the company s research programs  will be successfully developed  prove to be safe and efficacious at each stage of clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully marketed 
manufacturing the company owns a  square foot manufacturing facility in indianapolis  indiana  designed for the production of large commercial quantities of its products 
in august  following a retrofit of a portion of the facility to manufacture abelcet  the company received fda approval for commercial production of abelcet from that facility 
the facility has also been approved by several international regulatory authorities 
during  the company transferred the production of abelcet from its princeton manufacturing facility to indianapolis in order to take advantage of the manufacturing economies available from producing abelcet on a larger scale 
the company also has a multiproduct manufacturing facility at its princeton site 
this facility was designed to manufacture clinical and initial commercial quantities of the company s products and to accommodate manufacturing for future products using similar processes 
this facility has been approved by the fda for the manufacture of abelcet for sale in the united states and by regulatory authorities in other countries 
the company believes that its current facilities  staff and sources and availability of raw materials are adequate for the manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies of its products and for the production of commercial quantities of abelcet 
there is no assurance that evacettm or other developmental products can be successfully manufactured on a commercial scale at the company s current facilities 
in april  the company entered into a three year agreement with astra usa inc  a subsidiary of astra ab of sweden  to manufacture astra s mvi unit vial hereinafter referred to as  mvi 
mvi is used by severely ill  hospitalized patients in need of nutritional supplements 
the company will manufacture mvi at its indianapolis manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the agreement  astra usa will supply bulk quantities of the vitamin product and will market the finished product 
the company will sterilize  fill  package and perform quality control on mvi for astra usa 
the company expects to record revenues related to the astra agreement in the first quarter of marketing strategy in the united states and canada  the company markets abelcet through its own sales force of approximately forty experienced representatives 
sales representatives are based in key cities throughout north america and are solely dedicated to the marketing of abelcet to hospitals 
internationally  the company determines whether to market abelcet directly or with a partner on a country by country basis 
in addition  sales are realized on a named patient basis in certain countries where marketing approval has not yet been received 
in december  the company entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with laboratorios esteve sa esteve for the marketing of abelcet in spain and portugal 
esteve is a leading marketer of pharmaceutical products in spain and is headquartered in barcelona  spain 
under the agreement  esteve shall promote and sell abelcet  and the company is responsible for overall strategy and product management 
in the third quarter   the company entered into agreements with affiliates of wyeth ayerst international  inc wyeth ayerst  a division of american home products corporation  to be its marketing partners in france and italy 
subsequently  the company entered into additional agreements with wyeth ayerst to include the marketing of abelcet in the nordic countries 
wyeth ayerst has a strong presence in the european hospital market and is skilled in the infectious disease and oncology sectors  which are primary areas of abelcet usage 
during  the company entered into agreements with affiliates of wyeth ayerst to market abelcet in austria and greece 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an agreement with amgen australia pty 
ltd  a division of amgen nasdaq amgn  to market abelcet in australia 
for financial information concerning the company s domestic and international operations  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenues and note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit and working capital practices in the united states  the company sells abelcet primarily to drug wholesalers who  in turn  sell the product to hospitals and certain other third parties 
in some cases  product is sold by the company directly to institutions 
international sales generally are made to the company s marketing partners  in countries where such agreements have been established  and directly to hospitals in countries where the company has retained marketing rights 
hospitals overseas in general are funded directly by the governments of the respective countries 
the company s credit practices and related working capital needs are believed to be comparable to those of other market participants 
collection periods tend to be longer for sales outside the united states 
the company maintains credit insurance on large  selected accounts in the united states subject to a deductible 
customers may return defective or out of date merchandise for credit or replacement 
such returns have been insignificant 
human resources at the end of  the company had full time employees  of whom hold phd degrees and of whom hold phd degrees or the foreign equivalent 
of these employees  are engaged in research  development  clinical development and manufacturing activities  in sales and marketing and in administration 
the company considers its relations with its employees to be excellent 
none of its employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
the company attempts to offer competitive compensation and fringe benefits programs to its employees 
patents and proprietary technology the company considers the protection of its proprietary technology rights to be important to its business 
in addition to seeking united states patent protection for many of its inventions  the company files patent applications in canada  japan  western european countries and additional foreign countries on a selective basis in order to protect the inventions deemed to be important to the development of its foreign business 
at the end of  the company had united states patents as well as foreign counterpart patents  and united states patent applications and foreign counterpart patent applications including those filed in designated countries under patent treaties pending 
patents issued and applied for cover inventions  including new types of liposomes and their preparation processes  for the therapeutic application of liposomes  lipid purification  lipid based delivery systems and product compositions 
the company has acquired and licensed proprietary technology from universities  research organizations and other companies in return for payments and continuing royalty obligations 
the company has obtained patents in the united states for inventions which may be employed with respect to abelcet  evacet  tlc ell and the family of ceramides as well as aspects of the company s technology in gene therapy delivery and has patent applications pending in europe and japan for such inventions 
the company has been awarded patents and has patent applications pending for inventions  which may be employed with respect to these and other products  in various selected countries as well 
the company owns worldwide rights to manufacture and market abelcetr under its patent rights and other proprietary technology rights 
in connection with the reacquisition of product rights from bristol myers squibb bms in january  the company agreed to pay royalties to bms on sales of abelcetr 
the company also pays royalties to the university of texas on abelcetr sales pursuant to a litigation settlement finalized in july this settlement gave the company exclusive rights under a patent assigned to the university of texas by inventors at the md anderson cancer center relating to liposomal amphotericin b 
a portion of these royalties is offset against the royalty payments to bms 
other public and private institutions  including universities  may have filed applications for  or have been issued patents with respect to technology potentially useful or necessary to the company 
the scope and validity of such patents  the extent to which the company may wish or need to acquire licenses under such patents  and the cost or availability of such licenses  are currently unknown 
the company also intends to rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to maintain and develop its commercial position 
the company has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and advisors  and various companies with which it does business 
the company owns rights in the trademarks employed in its business 
abelcetr is a registered trademark in the united states and all of the european countries in which amphotericin b lipid complex injection is approved for marketing 
evacett is a trademark of the company pending registration in a number of countries 
other trademarks used by the company include the graphic ball logo  the name clear  the slogan  expanding the horizons of biotechnology  and other trademarks and service marks identifying the company s products and services 
governmental regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of the company s products and in its ongoing research and development activities 
in order to test clinically  to produce and to market products for human therapeutic use  mandatory procedures and safety standards established by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries must be followed 
the standard process required by the fda before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states includes i preclinical tests  ii submission to the fda of an application for an investigational new drug ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  iii adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in its intended application  iv submission to and acceptance by  the fda of an nda with respect to drugs or a product license application pla with respect to biologics  and v fda approval of the nda or pla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug or biologic 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered or licensed by the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by the fda and by other federal  state and local agencies and must comply with good manufacturing practices as appropriate for production 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the drug to humans  the drug is tested for dosage and tolerance 
phase ii involves detailed evaluation of safety and efficacy 
phase iii trials consist of larger scale evaluation of safety and efficacy and may require larger patient numbers  depending on the clinical indication for which marketing approval is sought 
the process of completing clinical testing and obtaining fda approval for a new product is likely to take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
the fda may grant an unconditional approval of a drug for a particular indication or may grant approval conditioned on further postmarketing testing 
even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially approved 
the fda may also require postmarketing testing and surveillance programs to monitor the drug s efficacy and possible side effects 
results of these postmarketing programs may prevent  or limit  the further marketing of the products 
sales of pharmaceutical products outside of the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
in the european union eu  the general trend has been toward coordination of common standards for clinical testing of new drugs 
generally  the level of regulation in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions is somewhat less comprehensive and burdensome than regulation in the united states  but there are differences and  in a few instances  foreign regulations may be more burdensome than fda requirements 
the time required to obtain regulatory approval from the comparable regulatory agencies in each foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
in addition  the company is and may be subject to regulation under state and federal law regarding occupational safety  laboratory practices  the use and handling of radioisotopes  environmental protection and hazardous substance control and to other present and possible future local  state  federal and foreign regulation 
competition competition in the pharmaceutical field generally  and in the liposome and lipid based pharmaceutical industries in particular  is intense and is based on such factors as product performance  safety  patient compliance  ease of use  price  physician acceptance  marketing  distribution and adaptability to various modes of administration 
technological competition may be based on the development of alternative products and approaches aimed at the treatment  diagnoses or prevention of the same diseases as the company s products 
competition from other companies will be based on scientific and technological factors  the availability of patent protection  the ability to commercialize technological developments  the ability to obtain government approval for testing  manufacturing and marketing and the economic factors resulting from the use of those products  including their price 
there are many companies  both public and private  including well known pharmaceutical and chemical companies  many of which have greater capital resources than the company  that are seeking to develop lipid and liposome based products as well as products based on other drug delivery technologies for therapeutic applications 
the company is aware that other companies are developing and marketing lipid based amphotericin b products 
the company s two principal competitors in the lipid based amphotericin b market are nexstar pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq nxtr and sequus pharmaceuticals inc which was acquired by alza corporation nyse aza at the end of nexstar pharmaceuticals and gilead sciences nasdaq gild recently announced a stock for stock merger agreement 
each of these companies products have regulatory approval in the united states and other countries 
the two principal competitors referred to in the preceding paragraph also have liposomal anthracycline products 
the fda has granted accelerated approval to one competitor for its product for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma where other agents have failed and has cleared for marketing the product of another competitor for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma 
these products are currently being marketed in the us and certain other countries for these indications 
no approvals have been granted by the fda for these products as treatment for solid tumors  although they are believed to be in development for certain types of cancer 
other groups active in the field include colleges  universities  and public and private research institutions which are becoming more active in seeking patent protection 
these institutions have also become increasingly competitive in recruiting personnel from a limited number of scientists and technicians 
additional risk factors the growth  financial performance and business condition of the company may be affected by a number of risk factors  including the matters discussed below uncertainty of government regulatory requirements  lengthy approval process human therapeutic products  vaccines and in vivo diagnostic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and approval by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries and  to a lesser extent  by state regulatory authorities prior to marketing 
the process of obtaining such approvals  especially for human therapeutic products  is likely to take a number of years and will involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
if the fda requests additional data  these time periods can be materially increased 
even after such additional data is submitted  there can be no assurance of obtaining fda approval 
in addition  product approvals may be withdrawn or limited for noncompliance with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing 
the company may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses 
future federal  state  local or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals  or failure to obtain approvals of the intended clinical uses requested  could delay or preclude the company from further developing particular products or from marketing their products  or limit the commercial use of the products and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
no assurance can be given with respect to the nda submitted to the fda by the company for commercial sale of evacet or for any of its products under development 
the company must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for use in each targeted indication 
the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in large scale testing  and there can be no assurance that the company s clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any products or will result in marketable products 
many pharmaceutical and drug delivery companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
volatility of stock price there has been a history of significant volatility in the market prices for shares of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry 
the market price of the shares of the company s common stock has been volatile 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  developments relating to regulatory approvals  governmental regulation  developments regarding product development activities  developments or disputes relating to patent or proprietary rights  as well as period to period fluctuations in revenues and financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing and adequate third party reimbursement the company s business may be materially adversely affected by the continuing efforts of worldwide governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of pharmaceutical products 
an increasing emphasis on managed care and consolidation of hospital purchasing in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing  which could reduce the price that the company is able to charge for any current or future products 
in addition  price competition may result from competing product sales  attempts to gain market share or introductory pricing programs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s ability to generate significant revenues from its products may also depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other payers 
if purchasers or users of the company s products are not entitled to adequate reimbursement for the cost of such products  they may forego or reduce such use 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available 
adequacy of product liability insurance the testing  manufacturing and marketing of the company s products entail an inherent risk of adverse events that could expose the company to product liability claims 
the company has obtained insurance against the risk of product liability claims 
however  there is no guarantee that this insurance will be adequate  that the amount of this insurance can be increased  or that the policies can be renewed 
moreover  the amount and scope of any coverage obtained may be inadequate to protect the company in the event of a successful product liability claim 
dependence on key personnel and consultants the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market products and to maintain a competitive position will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel and to develop and maintain relationships with leading research institutions and consultants 
competition for such personnel and relationships is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
dependence upon suppliers the company currently relies on a limited number of suppliers to provide the materials used to manufacture its products  certain of which materials are purchased only from one supplier 
in the event the company could not obtain adequate quantities of necessary materials from its existing suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to access alternative sources of supply within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates 
in particular  the company presently acquires amphotericin b  a principle ingredient in abelcetr  from one supplier on what the company believes are favorable terms 
although the company has qualified an alternative supplier for amphotericin b  the loss of the company s current supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the unavailability of adequate commercial quantities  the inability to develop alternative sources  a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture and market its product 
the company s dependence on and the uncertainty of protection of patents and proprietary rights 
the protection provided to the company by its patents and proprietary rights is key 
the company has a number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications relating to various aspects of lipid and liposome technologies 
the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance that any patents will afford the company commercially significant protection for its proprietary technology or have commercial application  and litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the company s proprietary rights 
moreover  the patent laws of foreign countries and the enforcement of such laws may afford less protection than comparable us laws 
in europe  several of the company s granted patents are being opposed by other companies 
loss of some of these oppositions may result in decreased patent protection for the company s products 
competition the company is aware of various products under development or manufactured by competitors that are used for the prevention  diagnosis or treatment of certain diseases the company has targeted for product development  some of which use therapeutic approaches that compete directly with certain of the company s product candidates 
some of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have significantly greater experience than the company in preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new or improved pharmaceutical products and in obtaining approval from the us food and drug administration fda and other regulatory approvals on products for use in health care 
in particular  the company is aware that other companies are developing lipid based or liposomal amphotericin b products and have obtained regulatory approvals for such products in certain markets 
two competitors received approvals for lipid based amphotericin b products in certain markets before abelcetr was approved  which may confer a competitive advantage for their products 
in the united states  although abelcetr was the first lipid based amphotericin b product to be approved for marketing  one competitor s product was approved in the fourth quarter of  and another competitor s product was approved in august although it cannot be predicted how the existence of competing lipid based products may affect the us antifungal market  it is possible that the company s share of this market will decline and that price competition will reduce the overall size of the market 
in addition  other companies are also developing liposomal anthracycline products similar to evacettm  two of which have been cleared by the fda for treatment of kaposi s sarcoma 
the company is also competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which the company has limited experience 
dependence on abelcetr revenues the company currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of abelcetr  it s only approved product 
the company s annual operating results depend upon a variety of factors including the price  volume and timing of abelcetr sales 
if demand for abelcetr were to decline or revenues were to fall  whether by introduction of competitive products or otherwise  the company s financial results would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues from the sale of abelcetr will not decline due to the aforementioned factors 
uncertainty of future financial results  fluctuations in operating results the company s quarterly operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the price  volume and timing of abelcetr sales  timing and amount of royalties  fees and contract revenues  the availability of third party reimbursement  and the regulatory approvals of new products  or expanded labeling of existing products 
the company s quarterly operating results may also fluctuate significantly depending on other factors  including the timing of approvals and the success of product launches in international markets  the expansion of clinical trials for abelcetr and evacett  changes in the company s level of research expenditures  and variations in gross margins that may be caused by increased costs of raw materials  competitive pricing pressures  or the mix between product sales in the united states and sales to the company s international marketing partners and distributors 
the company expects quarter to quarter fluctuations to continue in the future  and there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will not decline or that the company will ever achieve profitability 
the company s marketing staff competes with large pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
the company s products compete  and products the company may develop are likely to compete  with products of other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
because these companies are capable of devoting significantly greater resources to their marketing efforts  the company s marketing or sales efforts may not compete successfully against the efforts of these other companies 
year issues may not be addressed successfully the company is implementing a year project designed to address the issue of computer software and hardware correctly processing dates through and beyond the year due to the uncertainty inherent in the year problem  however  there can be no assurance that year failures will not have a material impact on the company s operations  financial results or financial condition 
in addition  the company cannot predict whether its critical third party suppliers and business partners will achieve year compliance  or whether the failure of any third party to do so would have a material effect on the company s business

during  the company marketed abelcetr in the us  canada and the united kingdom  with its own sales force 
for other countries  the company s general strategy is to market abelcetr through marketing partners 
specific marketing partnerships are determined on a country by country basis 
in addition  sales are realized on a named patient basis in certain countries where marketing approvals have not yet been received 
the company is developing evacettm formerly tlc d  liposomal doxorubicin  as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer and potentially other cancers 
three phase iii clinical studies of evacettm have been completed by the company 
results of these clinical trial studies indicate that evacettm is significantly less cardiotoxic than conventional doxorubicin while maintaining equivalent efficacy 
the company filed a new drug application nda for evacettm with the us food and drug administration fda in december there can be no assurance that the fda  having accepted the nda for evacettm  will grant the company marketing clearance for this product 
the company completed preclinical toxicology studies of tlc ell liposomal ether lipid  a new anticancer drug that may have applications for the treatment of many different cancers 
on october  the company announced that the fda has cleared the investigational new drug application for this product 
a phase i clinical trial has been designed to enroll adult patients with advanced solid tumors 
this trial commenced in february item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has a continuing discovery research program concentrating on oncology treatment and has a number of products in research 
these products include the bromotaxols hydrophobic derivatives of paclitaxel  some of which have shown anticancer activity in several experimental models  ceramides and sphingosines molecules widely implicated in cell differentiation and apoptosis certain of which the company has identified as displaying anticancer activity  and fusogenic liposomes liposomes specifically designed to fuse to cell membranes  which the company hopes to use for the efficient delivery of genes to their intended targets 
on june   the company announced results of a phase iii study of ventustm as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards  an inflammatory condition affecting the lungs 
the company s analysis of the two arms of the study showed no significant difference between patients receiving ventustm or placebo either in reducing the time on mechanical ventilation or in day mortality 
no safety concerns for the drug were identified 
following the results of the ventustm study  the company announced its intention to focus its resources on the development of an oncology franchise 
as part of implementing this strategy  the company restructured its operations to focus the organization on the development and marketing of oncology and related pharmaceuticals 
the restructuring eliminated positions  which resulted in unusual charges of  in the second quarter of additionally  in order to gain operational access to a second  potentially significant oncology related drug  the company reacquired  on july   all development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacettm from pfizer inc pfizer  which had previously been co developing evacettm with the company 
the company assumed control and the cost of all clinical studies  including the ongoing phase iii clinical studies that were previously being conducted by pfizer 
pfizer will receive royalties on worldwide except japan commercial sales of evacettm 
in july and august  the company entered into agreements to settle patent litigation with the university of texas and md anderson cancer center ut and with nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc and fujisawa usa  inc under the ut settlement the company received an exclusive license under ut s patent  paid past royalties on sales of abelcetr agreed to pay royalties on future sales  and issued to ut a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
under the nexstar settlement  the company received an initial payment of  in and began receiving in quarterly minimum payments classified as interest  investment and other income based on ambisome worldwide sales

the company will process and package astra s mvir unit vial  an injectable multi vitamin product used by severely ill  hospitalized patients in need of nutritional supplements 
the product will be processed and packaged at the company s indianapolis facility  taking advantage of its modern  large scale capabilities 
under the terms of the agreement  astra will supply bulk quantities of the vitamin product and the company will sterilize  fill  package and perform quality control on mvir unit vial 
the company expects to record revenues related to astra commencing in the first quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations revenues total revenues for the year ended january  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the primary components of revenues for the company are product sales of abelcetr  which commenced in  and interest  investment and other income 
collaborative research and development revenue was also included in the and periods  primarily due to the co development agreement with pfizer 
the revenue growth in is attributable to product sales of abelcetr both in the us and internationally 
partially offsetting the sales increase was the cessation of the collaborative research and development revenue during the second half of as a result of the reacquisition of evacettm from pfizer 
revenues in were  an increase of  or over the revenues of  the primary reason for the growth in was also due to increased market penetration of abelcetr worldwide  partially offset by the effect of the termination of the collaborative research and development agreement with pfizer in mid domestic and international net sales for the past three years were fiscal year ended us international january    december    december    domestic dollar sales in grew by over  while unit shipments increased by during the same period 
in the second quarter of  the company instituted a targeted pricing program in response to a competitor  by offering discounts to high volume purchasers 
the price reduction is effected by chargebacks paid to wholesalers based on their sales at contract prices to targeted hospitals 
the company believes that the reduced prices to large customers stimulated the demand for abelcetr and resulted in increased market penetration 
during the third quarter of  the company instituted a price increase to its domestic customers effective july  us sales are also subject to rebates pursuant to government mandated price protection programs 
the company provides a reserve for the impact on sales for these rebates and chargebacks and periodically evaluates the estimates used in establishing the reserve in order to make necessary adjustments 
the provision for the year ended january  was approximately  the increase in us sales in from of  or was also attributable to the factors previously discussed regarding the institution of the targeted pricing program and increased market penetration 
the rebate and chargeback provision for the year ended december  was approximately  internationally  the company has been approved to market abelcetr in markets 
in addition  sales are realized on a named patient basis in certain countries where marketing approval has not yet been received 
during  the company marketed abelcetr in the us  canada and the uk with it s own sales force 
for other countries  the company s general strategy is to market abelcetr through marketing partners  with specific marketing distribution alliances being determined on a country by country basis as future market approvals are received 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued international product sales were  for the year ended january    higher than the comparable prior year 
the majority of the growth is due to the impact of the launch of abelcetr in late in france  italy and canada  combined with sales growth in spain 
while international sales revenues increased by  unit volume increased by 
the principal reason for this difference is the mix of sales to end users ie direct distribution in certain countries versus sales to marketing partners in others 
international sales were  and  for and  respectively 
the majority of the increase was the result of growth throughout international markets including fourth quarter launches of abelcet in france  italy and canada  partially offset by lower sales in spain 
the company s international performance was also adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates due to the strong us dollar during collaborative research and development revenues were   and  for the years ended january   december  and december   respectively 
the revenue decline of  in from is due to the cessation of development funding by pfizer pursuant to the july  agreement in which the company reacquired all development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacettm from pfizer 
the revenue decline of  or in from was due to the mid year termination of the pfizer agreement as previously discussed 
interest  investment and other income for the year ended january  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this minimal increase is primarily due to the higher interest and investment income due to greater average cash balances available for investment in the company s portfolio during partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest  investment and other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  is primarily due to the receipt of  from nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc as part of the settlement of patent litigation  partially offset by lower interest and investment income due to lower average cash balances available for investment in the company s portfolio during compared to due to the company s reacquisition of rights to evacettm from pfizer  the company anticipates there will be no collaborative research and development revenues in the future  as it currently has no other agreements in place 
in the future  the company anticipates recognition of income related to the manufacturing agreement with astra 
the anticipated revenues from interest and investment income will be related to the level of cash balances available for investment and the rate of interest earned 
expenses the components of total expenses were cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative and interest expenses 
total expenses for the year ended january  were  a decrease of  or below the prior year 
total expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over included in the expenses were  of unusual charges incurred by the company following the unfavorable results of the ventust clinical study 
see specific categories for detail of changes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of goods sold for the year ended january   was  versus  in the period 
the decrease of  was due to lower manufacturing costs related to the high volume efficiencies realized during at the indianapolis facility  combined with the impact of the company s decision not to manufacture abelcetr during the last half of in order to reduce inventories 
as a result of this decision  certain manufacturing overhead and fixed costs for indianapolis were reflected in cost of goods sold in the period even though no product was manufactured 
partially offsetting the decrease is the impact of the higher sales volume in the period 
gross margin in the period was compared to in the period  an improvement of percentage points 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   was  versus  in the period 
the  or increase from to was a result of the increased unit volume of abelcet sold during and an unusual charge of  for royalties on past sales pursuant to the settlement of patent litigation with the university of texas 
during  the company implemented a planned shift in manufacturing sites from princeton to its high volume facility in indianapolis 
as a result of this transition  the company incurred certain costs as it adjusted inventory levels throughout the year 
the indianapolis facility was approved by the fda in august  and the company has reoriented the princeton facility to the production of clinical supplies 
gross margin was in and in  a decline of percentage points 
the decline was primarily due to the lower average price of abelcet during as a result of the targeted pricing program  coupled with costs related to the shift of manufacturing from princeton to the company s indianapolis facility and the unusual charge for royalties on past sales of abelcet pursuant to the litigation settlement 
research and development expenses  which also include clinical and regulatory activities  were  for the year ended january   compared to  for and  for the decrease of  from to  is primarily due to the completion of the pivotal phase iii studies of evacett for which the company filed a nda in december  and the absence of clinical study costs associated with ventust in partially offsetting the decrease  is increased research and development activity for tlc ell and the reorientation of the princeton manufacturing facility to the production of clinical supplies 
the decrease in spending of  from to is due to the absence in of pre production costs for the start up of the indianapolis manufacturing facility incurred in partially offsetting this decrease was the unusual charge of  of certain manufacturing overhead costs following the unfavorable results of the ventustm phase iii clinical study  combined with higher expenditures related to the development of evacettm and tlc ell in the second half of  the company assumed all the costs related to the clinical studies of evacettm pursuant to its reacquisition of the product from pfizer 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses for were  a decrease of  versus the principal reasons for the decrease were the absence in of the restructuring charge of  recorded in the second quarter of  and the elimination of litigation costs relating to the university of texas and nexstar patent lawsuits and reduced international sales and marketing expenditures due to the utilization of marketing partners internationally 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and december  were  and  respectively 
the increase of  is partially due to the restructuring charge of  following the unfavorable results of the ventustm phase iii study  increased legal expenses incurred in connection with intellectual property litigation  and higher sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in us sales and marketing expense is due to the sales force expansion that began in late and the growth of related sales and marketing efforts to defend market share from competition 
international sales and marketing costs also increased as abelcet was launched in france  italy and canada during the fourth quarter of interest expense was   and  for  and  respectively 
the largest components of costs are associated with the capital leases for the princeton and indianapolis manufacturing equipment and mortgage interest related to the indianapolis facility 
in november and january  the company exercised it s option to purchase certain manufacturing equipment under the original lease 
this refinancing of the princeton and indianapolis equipment leases for a three year period  caused an increase in interest expense in the period 
in december  the company expanded its equipment lease and received cash of  for indianapolis manufacturing assets  which caused higher interest expense in and preferred stock dividends in  the company had outstanding an issue of  depositary shares  each of which represented one tenth of a share of series a cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock carrying a dividend rate 
on march   the company called for the redemption of of the preferred stock  with the remainder being called on october  virtually all of the outstanding preferred stock was converted into common stock  thus eliminating the preferred stock dividend requirement in dividends of  were paid on the preferred stock in net loss  net loss applicable to common stock and net loss per share of common stock as a result of the factors discussed above  the company s net loss was   and  for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the net loss per share for these years were  and  respectively 
the fourth quarter of  was the first quarter that the company had an operating income of  or per share 
weighted average shares used in the per share calculations were   and  respectively 
the increase of  shares from to was attributable to the issuance of restricted stock and the k match 
the increase in average shares outstanding in compared to was due to the full years impact of shares issued pursuant to conversions of preferred stock and shares issued for cash in a private placement 
the number of shares of common stock used in each twelve month period to calculate basic and diluted loss per share were identical as the company was in a loss position in all the twelve month periods and the inclusion of contingently issuable shares would have been anti dilutive 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the company had  in cash and marketable securities as of january  included in this amount were cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and restricted cash of  the company invests its cash reserves in a diversified portfolio of high grade corporate marketable and united states government backed securities 
the market value of certain securities in the company s investment portfolio at january  was below their acquisition cost 
this unrealized loss is recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
cash and marketable securities both short term and restricted cash increased  from december  to january  the primary components of the favorable impact on cash flow were the lower inventories of  the higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  the lower accounts receivable of  and cash flow from operations net loss less depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges of  the major uses of funds were the principal repayments on the capital lease and note payable totaling  and capital spending of  inventories at january  decreased  from december  during  the company completed its plan to shift manufacturing of abelcetr from princeton to its new  more cost efficient facility in indianapolis  indiana 
in order to ensure a smooth transition  the company increased its inventory of abelcetr during the first half of fda approval of the indianapolis facility was received during the third quarter of  and the company has reoriented the princeton manufacturing facility to the production of clinical supplies 
as planned  the company has reduced inventories to levels consistent with demand for abelcetr 
accounts payable at january  was  or  higher than december  and accrued expenses and other current liabilities were  or  higher than the prior year 
the variance in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
the increase in accrued expense is primarily due to increased bonuses as well as royalty payments relating to abelcetr sales 
in july  the company entered into a capitalized lease financing agreement for certain manufacturing equipment providing for an initial lease term followed by options to extend the lease  or to return or purchase the equipment 
in december  the agreement was amended to include an additional  of manufacturing equipment 
in november and january  the company exercised its options to purchase certain manufacturing equipment under the original lease for  and  respectively 
these amounts have been re financed as a capital lease obligation under the lease agreement for a three year period 
the lease is collateralized by  in standby letters of credit which are in return collateralized by aaa rated securities owned by the company 
pursuant to the december lease amendment  the company is required to maintain a minimum balance of  in cash and marketable securities  including those securities collateralizing the letters of credit 
in addition  the company completed a us working capital revolving credit line agreement in early  with a maximum capacity of  all borrowings must be secured by approved accounts receivable and finished goods inventories 
the company has a pledge of  to support this agreement  which has been classified as restricted cash 
there have been no advances made against this line through the date of this report 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as part of the agreement to repurchase the development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacettm  the company obtained from pfizer a credit line of up to  to continue the development of evacettm 
to the extent that any funding is actually used by the company  the outstanding principal and interest would be repayable on the earlier of days after fda clearance to market evacettm or in twenty quarterly installments commencing july  pfizer at its option may elect to receive payment in the form of shares of common stock 
at the end of  there were no borrowings under this facility 
the company has a mortgage backed note to partially fund the purchase of the indianapolis manufacturing facility 
the principal balance outstanding at january  is  on april  the company issued  shares of common stock at per share to a private investor for cash of  at february   this investor has reported total holdings of approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
at january   the company had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of research and development credit carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes 
these carryforwards expire in the years through the timing and manner in which these losses are used may be limited as provided by irs regulations under section of the internal revenue code 
in january  the company completed an offering of  depositary shares  each of which represented one tenth of a share of preferred stock carrying a dividend rate 
on march   the company called for the redemption of of the preferred stock with the remainder being called on october  virtually all of the outstanding preferred stock was converted into common stock 
combined net issuance costs including financial advisory  professional  registration and filing fees of  were incurred in connection with both calls and were charged to equity 
as a result of these conversions  the company s annual preferred stock dividend requirements have been eliminated 
the company expects to finance its operations and capital spending requirements from  among other things  the proceeds received from product sales  interest earned on investments and the proceeds from maturity or sale of certain investments 
cash may also be provided to the company by leasing arrangements for capital expenditures  financing of receivables and inventory under its line of credit  a line of credit from a former licensing partner  the licensing of its products and technology and the sale of equity or debt securities 
the company believes that its product revenues and revenues from other sources  coupled with its available cash and marketable securities reserves  will be sufficient to meet its expected operating and capital cash flow requirements for the intermediate term 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year compliance the year computer issue yk refers to a condition in computer software where a two digit field rather than a four digit field is used to distinguish a calendar year 
for example  would be stored as  rather than 
the basic problem is that when the year changes from to the year  some computer programs will be unable to distinguish the correct date 
such a situation could significantly interfere with the conduct of the company s business  disrupt its operations and materially impact its financial condition 
in order to address this situation  the company has conducted a year assessment of its core business information systems including a wide variety of other information systems and related business processes hereinafter  collectively referred to as the systems used in its operations 
the goal of the assessment was to identify and determine the yk readiness of the company s systems 
the task of assessing the systems from a yk readiness perspective has been accomplished 
accordingly  the company has developed a comprehensive remediation plan and scheduled the necessary hardware  software  and sub component upgrades to remediate non yk compliant systems 
the systems investigated were categorized into the following three areas the first category involves the traditional management information systems that include computers  telecommunication devices  application software  operating system software  and related peripherals 
due to the fact that the majority of the systems installed and in use at the company are new and utilize current technologies the effort and expense to bring these systems into yk compliance will not be material 
overall estimated costs for systems remediation is expected to be less than  a portion of this estimate   is for the replacement or upgrade of components that are  or would have been  included in and capital budgets but have been accelerated due to the yk issue 
roughly one third of the estimated  expense has already been expended to make the required hardware and software upgrades 
the remaining systems will be brought into compliance by mid year 
the second category involves manufacturing and facility systems including machines and devices used to manufacture  store  and test the company s product 
it also includes the systems that control and monitor the company s facilities such as hvac  fire suppression  and elevators 
equipment used in the manufacture and storage of product has been reviewed with regard to yk readiness 
again  because of the absence of older legacy systems  a minimal amount of effort is required to make these systems compliant 
of the systems reviewed  were found to be compliant with no remedial actions required 
the estimated cost to bring the non compliant equipment up to standard will be less than  these upgrades will be completed by the middle of the third category involves research systems including computer controlled devices  calibration equipment  and similar instruments 
review of research development equipment found the majority of the computers and laboratory equipment to be yk compliant 
cost of replacing non yk ready equipment was  and has been completed 
in addition to the assessment of the systems  key suppliers and customers have been identified 
a survey form was developed and has been sent to each of these business entities in order to determine if their systems are yk compliant 
this is significant since delays in the shipment and receipt of critical supplies can impact the company s production 
problems would also exist if customers become unable to pay for the company s product eg  their accounts payable system fails or if they cannot electronically order  store  or track product in compliance with fda requirements 
the company is proactively addressing the yk issue with these vendors and suppliers in order to minimize risk from these external factors 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued based on the assessment of its systems  the company believes that the costs of addressing the yk issue will be less than  also based on the assessment of its systems  the company believes that it has minimized the potential for disruption of its business because of the yk event 
however  if key third parties such as suppliers and customers are not yk ready  such problems could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
to minimize the impact of supplier product shortages that may result the company plans to have sufficient supplies on hand to meet its production requirements 
the company will also encourage its customers to have an adequate supply of abelcetr on hand to meet their anticipated needs 
certain risk factors this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
examples of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  i the progress of clinical trials and preclinical studies regarding evacett  tlc ell and other oncology products in the company s research pipeline  ii the ability of abelcetr to maintain its position as the leading lipid based formulation of amphotericin b in the us  iii the likelihood of future domestic and international regulatory approvals for evacett or any other product in the research pipeline  iv the expansion of sales efforts regarding abelcetr  v possible new licensing or contract manufacturing agreements  vi future product revenues from abelcetr  evacett or any other product in the research pipeline  vii the future uses of capital  and financial needs of the company  viii manufacturing efficiencies and other benefits to be realized from use of the indianapolis facility  ix the recording of revenues relating to the astra contract  and x resolution of year computer issues 
while these statements are made by the company based on management s current beliefs and judgment  they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and investors should specifically consider a number of factors and assumptions  including those discussed in the text and the financial statements and their accompanying footnotes in this report 
among these factors and assumptions that could affect the forward looking statements in this report are the following a the commercialization of abelcet is still ongoing and the ultimate rate of sales of abelcet is uncertain  b the company s other products are in development and have not yet received regulatory approvals for sale  and it is difficult to predict when such approvals will be received and  if approved  whether the products can be successfully commercialized  c competitors of the company have developed and are developing products that are competitive with the company s products  d the rate of sales of the company s products could be affected by regulatory actions  decisions by government health administration authorities or private health coverage insurers as to the level of reimbursement for the company s products  e risks associated with international sales  such as currency exchange rates  currency controls  tariffs  duties  taxes  export license requirements and foreign regulations  f uncertainty that key customers  vendors and suppliers of the company will be yk compliant  g the levels of protection afforded by the company s patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain and may be challenged  and h the company has incurred losses in each year since its inception and there can be no assurance of profitability in any future period
