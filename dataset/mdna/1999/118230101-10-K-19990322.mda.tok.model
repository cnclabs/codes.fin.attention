item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources and the results of operations of the partnership for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations through its operating partnerships  the partnership is principally engaged in the transportation of refined petroleum products including gasoline  aviation turbine fuel  diesel fuel  heating oil and kerosene 
the partnership s revenues are principally a function of the volumes of refined petroleum products transported by the partnership  which are in turn a function of the demand for refined petroleum products in the regions served by the partnership s pipelines and the tariffs or transportation fees charged for such transportation 
results of operations are affected by factors which include general economic conditions  weather  competitive conditions  demand for products transported  seasonality and regulation 
see business competition and other business considerations 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent less than revenue of million for volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the combination of higher volumes and lower revenues in as compared to is the result of several factors 
in  the partnership experienced a slight shift in deliveries from longer haul  higher tariff movements to shorter haul  lower tariff movements 
in addition  certain tariffs designed to recover capital costs expired in and were replaced by lower tariffs 
the partnership also had greater costs associated with product downgrades resulting from normal operating activities 
gasoline volumes and revenue increased over levels 
new business was gained at midland  pennsylvania as a result of a new connection  and market share throughout pennsylvania continued to grow in in addition  increased volumes in the detroit and flint  michigan areas added to the favorable variance 
offsetting these increases were declines in volume to the upstate new york area 
distillate volumes and revenue declined over levels 
demand was weak throughout most areas due to abnormally warm weather primarily during the first quarter of turbine fuel volumes increased slightly over levels although overall revenue declined 
demand was strong at newark airport but was offset by declines at pittsburgh due to reductions in both military and commercial airline activity 
lpg volumes and revenue increased over levels due to the capture of new business in ohio 
tariff rate increases implemented in also had a favorable impact on revenues 
see tariff changes 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent less than costs and expenses of million during during  as part of a restructuring  the partnership incurred severance and related expenses of million and an additional million expense associated with the realignment of senior management 
payroll overhead expenses declined as a result of the esop restructuring in and a full year effect of the elimination of certain executive compensation costs formerly charged to the partnership 
such senior executive compensation costs have not been charged to the partnership since august  see executive compensation 
the partnership also realized cost reductions in outside service expense and incurred less power expense during partially offsetting these reductions was the full year effect of amortization of the deferred charge related to the issuance of lp units under the esop restructuring 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  minority interests and other 
total other expenses decreased by million 
interest expense declined by million due to the early extinguishment of higher interest rate debt with the proceeds of lower interest rate debt during december partially offsetting these declines in expenses were increased incentive compensation payments to bmc as a result of greater cash distributions to unitholders see certain relationships and related transactions and an increase in minority interest expense related to greater net income 
income from invested cash also declined from levels 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent greater than revenue of million for volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the major portion of this increase was related to increased turbine fuel deliveries to newark  j 
f 
kennedy  miami and detroit airports 
at newark  j 
f 
kennedy and miami airports  turbine fuel demand continued to grow at a steady rate  while at detroit the increases were attributable primarily to the installation of new facilities and the addition of a new shipper 
gasoline volumes also increased over levels 
the increase in gasoline volumes were attributable primarily to market share growth throughout pennsylvania 
the filing of tariff incentives has also led to increased volumes and revenue at various locations 
gasoline revenue overall  however  declined slightly due to the loss of longer haul  higher tariff volumes particularly to the upstate new york area and certain midwest locations that are being supplied with shorter haul  lower tariff volumes 
distillate volumes and revenues in were comparable to volumes  while liquefied petroleum gas and other product volumes declined resulting in lower revenues 
tariff rate increases implemented in also had a favorable impact on revenues 
see tariff changes 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent less than costs and expenses of million during payroll expenses declined as the result of a staff reduction program implemented in and the non recurrence of the million charge recorded in connection with that program 
payroll and payroll overhead expenses were also lower since certain senior executive compensation costs have not been charged to the partnership following august   in accordance with the terms of the esop restructuring 
professional fee expenses also declined due to reduced expenses associated with the esop restructuring 
offsetting these decreases to some extent were increases in rental expense and the amortization of deferred charges related to the issuance of lp units under the esop restructuring 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
total other expenses increased by million 
a million gain on the sale of property in did not recur in in addition  increased incentive compensation payments to bmc as a result of greater cash distributions to unitholders  and the settlement of a lawsuit brought in connection with the esop restructuring  increased expenses 
see certain relationships and related transactions 
offsetting these increases  to some extent  was a decline in minority interest expense related to the decline in net income 
tariff changes effective january  certain of the operating partnerships implemented tariff increases that were expected to generate approximately million in additional revenue per year 
the operating partnerships did not increase tariff rates during in  certain tariffs were increased that  at the time of filing  were expected to generate approximately million in additional revenue per year 
competition and other business conditions several major refiners and marketers of petroleum products announced strategic alliances or mergers in and these alliances or mergers have the potential to alter refined product supply and distribution patterns within the operating partnerships market area resulting in both gains and losses of volume and revenue 
while the general partner believes that individual delivery locations within its market area may have significant gains or losses  it is not possible to predict the overall impact these alliances or mergers would have on the operating partnerships business 
however  the general partner does not believe that these alliances or mergers will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership s financial condition at december   and is highlighted in the following comparative summary liquidity and capital indicators as of december  current ratio to to to ratio of cash and temporary investments and trade receivables to current liabilities to to to working capital deficit in thousands    ratio of total debt to total capital

capital expenditures are generally for expansion of the operating partnerships service capabilities and sustaining the operating partnerships existing operations 
capital expenditures by the partnership were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
projected capital expenditures for are approximately million and are expected to be funded from cash generated by operations and buckeye s bank line of credit 
see business capital expenditures 
planned capital expenditures include  among other things  installation of transmix tanks  renewal and replacement of several tank roofs and seals  upgrades to field instrumentation and cathodic protection systems  installation and replacement of mainline pipe and valves  facility automation and various facility improvements that facilitate increased pipeline volumes 
capital expenditures are expected to remain at approximately this level for the next few years as a result of the general partner s plan to automate certain facilities in order to more effectively control operating costs 
environmental matters the operating partnerships are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations  as well as the partnership s own standards relating to protection of the environment  cause the operating partnerships to incur current and ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
during  the operating partnerships incurred operating expenses of and capital expenditures of million for environmental matters 
capital expenditures of million for environmental related projects are included in the partnership s plans for expenditures  both capital and operating  relating to environmental matters are expected to continue due to the partnership s commitment to maintain high environmental standards and to increasingly rigorous environmental laws 
various claims for the cost of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and for damage to the environment resulting from the activities of the operating partnerships or their predecessors have been asserted and may be asserted in the future under various federal and state laws 
the general partner believes that the generation  handling and disposal of hazardous substances by the operating partnerships and their predecessors have been in material compliance with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements 
the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating partnerships relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to each site  however  the operating partnership involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or of any future claims and proceedings

employee stock ownership plan in connection with the acquisition  the esop was formed for the benefit of employees of bmc  the general partner and the shareholders of bmc 
bmc borrowed million pursuant to a year term loan from a third party lender 
bmc then loaned million to the esop  which used the loan proceeds to purchase million of series a convertible preferred stock of bac bac preferred stock 
the bac preferred stock had a cumulative dividend rate and a conversion rate of approximately shares of bac common stock per share of bac preferred stock 
in december  the board of directors of bmc approved the esop restructuring 
the esop restructuring was approved by a majority of the holders of the lp units at a special meeting held on august  on august   in connection with the esop restructuring  the partnership issued an additional  lp units adjusted for a two for one split which are beneficially owned by the esop through services company 
the market value of the lp units issued to services company was approximately million 
as a result of the partnership s issuance of the lp units  the partnership s obligation to reimburse bmc for certain executive compensation costs was permanently released  the incentive compensation formula was reduced  and other changes were implemented to make the esop a less expensive fringe benefit for the partnership 
the million market value of the lp units issued to services company was recorded as a deferred charge relating to the esop restructuring and is being amortized over years 
as part of the esop restructuring  the million loan from the third party lender became a direct obligation of the esop which is secured by the stock of services company and guaranteed by bmc and certain of its affiliates

accounting statements not yet adopted accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this standard will be effective for the partnership s financial statements in the year the general partner has not yet assessed the impact of this new standard on the partnership s financial statements 
information systems year compliance in  the partnership established a comprehensive plan to assess the impact of the year issue on the software and hardware utilized by the partnership s internal operations and pipeline control systems 
as part of that assessment  a team is in the process of reviewing and documenting the status of the partnership s systems for year compliance 
the key information systems under review include financial systems  pipeline operating systems  and the partnership s scada supervisory control and data acquisition system 
in connection with each of these areas  consideration is being given to hardware  operating systems  applications  database management  system interfaces  electronic transmission and outside vendors 
the partnership relies on third party suppliers for certain systems  products and services including telecommunications 
the partnership has received certain information concerning year status from a group of critical suppliers and vendors  and anticipates receiving additional information in the near future that will assist the partnership in determining the extent to which the partnership may be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their year issues 
at this time  the partnership believes that the total cost for known or anticipated remediation of its information systems to make them year compliant will not be material 
management of the partnership believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
completion of the plan and testing of replacement or modified systems is anticipated for the third quarter of nevertheless  since it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the partnership would be unable to take customer orders  ship petroleum products  invoice customers or collect payments 
the effect on the partnership s liabilities and revenues due to a failure of its systems or a third party system cannot be predicted 
the company has contingency plans for some pipeline critical applications  involving manual operations  and is working on additional contingency plans to address unavoided or unavoidable risks associated with year issues
