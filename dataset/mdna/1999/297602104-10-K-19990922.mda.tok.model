until the fiscal year beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal year however  the company does not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on its financial results 
year the company expects to implement the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues and does not believe the cost of such actions has or will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  there is no guarantee that the company  its suppliers or other third parties will be able to make all of the modifications necessary to address year issues on a timely basis 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company views all of its retail  wholesale and manufacturing applications as mission critical 
the company recently converted its retail  wholesale and a portion of its manufacturing applications onto one single mid range computer  utilizing newly acquired integrated software 
the newly implemented software is substantially compliant  with all date fields expanded to four digits 
the company formed a redundant environment and has rolled the date forward to the year and has completed testing all of its business transactions 
concurrently with the aforementioned project  the company has been remediating its pre existing manufacturing systems 
this process is complete in the company s wood and upholstery manufacturing facilities 
substantial progress has been made in the company s accessory manufacturing systems 
the accessory systems are expected to be fully compliant by september  investments have been made in the company s peripheral hardware 
these investments were necessitated by the retail and wholesale systems conversion 
the company compiled a comprehensive data base of hardware and associated software that is currently in service 
the company expects all hardware to be remediated or replaced by september  to date  the company has expended less than million in capital expenditures related to year remediation 
the company s vertical integrated structure might to some degree mitigate the impact of third parties year issues to adversely affect the company 
however  the company anticipates the possibility that not all of its vendors  retailers and other third parties will have taken the necessary steps to adequately address their respective year issues on a timely basis 
in order to minimize the impact on the company  a project team has been formed to monitor the activities of third parties  including sending out inquiries and evaluating responses 
notwithstanding the progress the company has made thus far in remediating its existing systems and implementing new systems  the company is proceeding in finalizing its formal contingency plan  including monitoring its independent retailers 
the company intends to continue monitoring the progress of others in order to determine whether adequate services will be provided to run the company s operations in the year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at june   the company had million of short term debt outstanding and million of total long term debt outstanding 
the company has one debt instrument outstanding with a variable interest rate 
this debt instrument has a principal balance of million which matures in based on the principal outstanding in  a one percentage point increase in the variable interest rate would not have had a significant impact on the company s interest expense 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instruments transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure
