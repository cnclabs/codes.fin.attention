see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s major uses of cash have historically been for acquisitions  working capital to support sales growth and ongoing capital expenditures 
sources of cash have typically included operating cash flow  bank borrowings and proceeds from the sale of common stock 
in october  the company completed a public offering pursuant to which the company issued and sold  shares of its common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used the net proceeds from such offering to reduce debt  and to expand its manufacturing infrastructure primarily through acquisitions and capital expenditures

non us dollar borrowings are limited to million 
there are not scheduled amortization payments or repayment penalties 
the facility terminates and is repayable in full on august  the company conducts business in countries outside of the united states which exposes the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into short term forward exchange contracts to hedge this risk  nevertheless  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has significant operations in europe and  to a lesser extent  in latin america 
the introduction of a single european currency is expected to reduce the currency risks associated with inter european transactions 
however  risks will remain with respect to transactions with customers or suppliers outside of the zone covered by the single european currency 
the company s operations in latin america are carried out primarily in brazil  costa rica and colombia 
although currently not classified as a hyper inflationary country  brazil has been classified as such in the past 
the company believes that the cash from operations and borrowings available under the company s revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
capital expenditures during the next twelve months are expected to approximate million  assuming that the company does not make any acquisitions 
net operating loss carry forwards the company had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately million at january   of which approximately million expire through and million do not expire 
seasonality as a result of the acquisition of sli  bv  it is expected that the company s operations will experience certain seasonal patterns 
generally  sli  bv s sales have been highest in the fourth quarter of each year due to abbreviated daylight hours and increased holiday light usage 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addressing the year issue  the company has identified the following phases 
in the awareness phase  the company defined the year issue and obtained executive level support and funding 
in the inventory phase  the company collected a comprehensive list of items that may be affected by year compliance issues 
such items include facilities and related non information technology systems embedded technology used in production and manufacturing systems  computer systems  hardware  and services and products provided by third parties 
in the assessment phase  the company evaluated the items and affected systems identified in the inventory phase to determine which will need to be remediated and prioritized remediation based on the potential impact to the company 
affected systems include automated assembly lines and related robotic technologies used in various aspects of the manufacturing process 
however  based on a review of its product line  the company has determined that most of the products it has sold and will continue to sell do not require remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to its products 
the remediation phase includes an analysis of the items that are affected by year  the identification of problem areas and the repair or replacement of non compliant items 
in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company attempts to obtain replacements that it believes are year compliant and requests representations from manufacturers 
the testing phase includes testing of all proposed repairs  including present and forward date testing which simulates dates in the year the implementation phase consists of placing all items that have been remediated and successfully tested into production 
utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications  the company currently anticipates that its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts will be completed by december  and that such efforts will be completed prior to any currently anticipated impact on computer equipment and software 
the company estimates that as of january   it had completed approximately of the initiatives that it believes will be necessary to fully address potential year issues relating to computer equipment and software 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date the company has incurred approximately million million capitalized for new systems and equipment and 
million expensed  related to all phases of the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software and operating equipment  which will be capitalized 
the remaining 
million relates to repair of hardware and software and will be expensed as incurred 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issued in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company would be unable to take orders  manufacture and ship products  invoice customers or collect payments 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
although the company has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if the company or any of the third parties upon which the company is dependent is unable to achieve year readiness  the company s year compliance program is on going and its ultimate scope  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories  and adjusting staffing strategies 
the foregoing year discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of there are many uncertainties involved in the year issue  including the extent to which the company will be able to successfully remediate systems and adequately provide for contingencies that may arise  as well as the broader scope of the year issues as it may affect third parties that are not controlled by the company 
accordingly  the costs and results of the company s year program and the extent of any impact on the company s operations could vary materially from those stated herein
