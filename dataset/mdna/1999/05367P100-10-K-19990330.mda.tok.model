in august  the company acquired the common stock of softimage and certain assets related to the business of softimage for total consideration of million 
softimage is a leading developer of d animation  video production  d cel animation and compositing software solutions and technologies 
the acquisition was recorded as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of softimage are included in the company s financial statements as of the acquisition date 
the company s results of operations for the year ended december  include a pre tax charge of million for the value of acquired in process research and development and amortization of million related to intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition 
excluding this one time charge and amortization  pro forma net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative nonrecurring costs amortization of acquisition related intangible assets total operating expenses operating income loss other income and expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss excluding nonrecurring costs of of revenues and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of of revenues  both of which are related to the acquisition of softimage  pro forma net income was of revenues 
net revenues the company s net revenues have been derived mainly from the sales of computer based digital  nonlinear media editing systems and related peripherals  licensing of related software  and sales of related software maintenance contracts 
net revenues increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in net revenues for the year ended december  of million increased by million from million in the increase in net revenues during was primarily attributable to incremental revenue related to product lines acquired in the softimage transaction  increased unit sales of avid xpress products for macintosh and nt platforms  and increased sales of media composer products  partially offset by decreases in sales of system upgrades and avid cinema 
the increase in net revenues during was primarily the result of growth in unit sales of mcxpress products for macintosh and nt platforms  storage systems  and digital audio products 
during  the company introduced numerous new products  including symphony  media composer  softimage ds  avid express for windows nt  pro tools mix  and marquee 
additionally  the company introduced numerous version updates of existing products  including version of media composer and film composer  version and of avid xpress and mcxpress  respectively  and version of the media browse module of avidnews 
during  the company began shipments of new versions of mcxpress and avid xpress  audiovision  pro tools  avidnews and mediashare fibre channel 
to date  product returns of all products have been immaterial 
the company continues to shift an increasing proportion of its sales through indirect channels  such as distributors and resellers 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were greater than of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to greater than of net revenue for and for international sales sales to customers outside north america accounted for of the company s net revenues  compared to for and for international sales increased by in compared to and by in compared to the increase in international sales for compared to and the increase for compared to reflected increases in europe  partly offset by lower sales in the asia pacific region 
gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  test  and distribution of finished products  provisions for inventory obsolescence  warehousing  and post sales customer support costs 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  and sales of aftermarket hardware products 
gross margin increased to in  compared to in and in the increase during was primarily due to lower vendor material costs  improved service margins and a favorable product mix 
the increase during was primarily due to lower material costs and manufacturing efficiencies  reduced discounts and other sales promotion programs  and a favorable product mix 
the company currently expects gross margins during to be consistent with the levels 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to and increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increased expenditures in were primarily due to five months of incremental softimage costs as well as additions to the company s engineering staff for the continued development of new and existing products 
the increased expenditures in were primarily due to provisions resulting from the company s profit sharing plan and additions to the company s engineering staff for the continued development of new and existing products 
offsetting the increase was the allocation in of product marketing costs to sales and marketing expenses rather than to research and development expenses  as that allocation more appropriately reflected the activities of that function 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in primarily due to the increases in research and development expenses for noted above 
the decrease to in from in was due to the allocation of product marketing costs to sales and marketing and the increase in net revenues  offset by increased expenditures due to continued development of new and existing products 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to and decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increased expenditures in were primarily due to five months of incremental softimage costs as well as an increase in marketing programs  offset by ongoing savings in selling expenses as a result of the shift to an indirect sales model 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in was primarily due to the effect of the restructuring of the company s sales and marketing operations during the first quarter of to an indirect sales model 
the company had shifted its primary distribution emphasis from a direct sales force to indirect sales channels  which reduced certain costs including direct sales compensation and office overhead expenses in and the reduction in costs was partially offset by the allocation in of product marketing costs to sales and marketing rather than to research and development 
marketing and selling expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in the increase in was primarily due to the increases in selling and marketing expenses noted above 
the decrease in was primarily due to the increase in net revenues in compared to general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million in the year ended december  compared to and increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increased expenditures in were primarily due to five months of incremental softimage costs as well as higher compensation related costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to was primarily due to provisions resulting from the company s profit sharing plan 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  and from in the increase in was primarily due to the increases in general and administrative expenses noted above 
nonrecurring costs and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage  the company allocated million to in process research and development  million to intangible assets consisting of completed technologies  work force and trade name  and million to goodwill 
in process research and development represented development projects in areas that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  its value of million was expensed as of the acquisition date and is reflected as a nonrecurring charge to operations in results for the year ended december  also reflect amortization of million associated with the acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  as well as a tax benefit of million related to the charge for in process research and development see note o and q to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets  including acquired in process research and development  were based on results of an independent appraisal 
the values of completed technologies and in process research and development were determined using a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
in process research and development projects identified at the acquisition date included next generation three dimensional modeling  animation and rendering software  and new graphic  film and media management capabilities for effects intensive  on line finishing applications for editing 
a description of each project follows next generation three dimensional modeling  animation and rendering software 
the efforts required to develop this project into a commercially viable product principally relate to completion of the animation and real time playback architecture  completion and integration of architectural software components  validation of the resulting architecture  and finalization of the feature set 
as of the acquisition date  the company assessed that the overall project was complete and calculated a value of million for this in process research and development 
the estimated costs to complete this project as of the acquisition date were million  of which million has been incurred through december  the company currently expects to incur million of additional costs during fiscal year development costs through december  and as expected to be incurred in the future are higher than originally anticipated due to challenges encountered in the development process 
anticipated completion of this project is expected during the second half of  at which time the company expects to begin to benefit economically 
new graphics  film and media management capabilities for effects intensive  on line finishing 
the efforts required to develop this project into a commercially viable product principally relate to the rebuilding of the framework architecture  the rewriting of software code of the compositing engine to accommodate significant new features  and the rewriting of software code of the titling component 
as of the acquisition date  the company assessed that the overall project was complete and calculated a value of million for this in process research and development 
the estimated costs to complete this project as of the acquisition date were million  of which million has been incurred through december  the company currently expects to incur million of additional costs during fiscal year development costs through december  and as expected to be incurred in the future are higher than originally anticipated due to the addition of features and functionality  which has expanded the scope of the original project 
anticipated completion of this project is expected during the second half of  at which time the company expects to begin to benefit economically 
the value of in process research and development  specifically  was determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process projects into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  discounting the net cash flows back to their present values  and adjusting that result to reflect each project s stage of completion 
the expected cash flows of the in process projects were adjusted to reflect the contribution of completed and core technologies 
total revenues from these in process projects were forecast to peak in and to decline from to as new products are expected to be introduced by the company 
these revenue forecasts were based on management s estimate of market size and growth  expected trends in technology  and the expected timing of new product introductions 
a discount rate of was used for valuing the in process research and development 
the discount rate was higher than the company s implied weighted average cost of capital due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development and the related risk of realizing cash flows from products that have not yet reached technological feasibility  among other factors 
total revenues from the completed technologies were forecasted to peak in and to decline through the company discounted the net cash flows of the completed technology to their present value using a discount rate of 
the company believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the date of acquisition 
the company cannot be assured  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected product sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the company currently expects to complete the in process projects 
however  risk is associated with the completion of the projects  and the company cannot be assured that the projects will meet with either technological or commercial success 
if these projects are not successfully developed or commercially viable  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded charges for nonrecurring costs consisting of million for restructuring charges related to february staffing reductions of approximately employees primarily in the us  the company s concurrent decision to discontinue certain products and development projects  and million for product transition costs in connection with the transition from nubus to pci bus technology in certain of its product lines 
included in the million for restructuring charges were approximately million of cash payments and million of non cash charges 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded charges for costs of million  associated primarily with the company s decision not to release the avid media spectrum product line 
approximately million of the million nonrecurring charge related to non cash items associated with the write off of assets 
the company has completed the related restructuring actions 
in the first quarter of  the company acquired digidesign  inc  parallax software limited  space software limited and elastic reality  inc in connection with these acquisitions  the company recorded merger costs of approximately million  of which million represented direct transaction expenses and million consisted of various restructuring charges 
other income and expense  net interest and other income  net  consists of interest income  other income and interest expense 
interest and other income  net  for  which consisted primarily of interest income  increased approximately  from which  in turn  increased million from for the years ended december  and december   interest and other income  net  increased primarily due to higher cash and investment balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes the company s effective tax rate was   and  respectively  for   and the tax rate for includes a benefit of million related to the pre tax charge of for in process technology associated with the company s acquisition of softimage inc a portion of the charge is not deductible for us federal tax purposes 
excluding the charge and related tax benefit  the company s effective tax rate would have been for the pro forma and actual effective tax rate of is different from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the company s foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed in the aggregate at a lower rate  and the us federal research tax credit 
the effective tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of the company s foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed in the aggregate at a lower rate 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date through both private and public sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
with respect to cash flow  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in during the twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for the charge for in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of softimage and depreciation and amortization 
during the twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income adjusted for depreciation  as well as increases in accounts payable and income taxes payable and reductions in inventory 
in  the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to provisions for profit sharing while the reduction in inventory resulted from improved inventory turns

year readiness disclosure the company has a worldwide program in place to address its exposure to the year issue 
this program is designed to minimize the possibility of significant year interruptions 
possible worst case scenarios include the interruption of significant parts of the company s business as a result of critical business systems failures or failures experienced by suppliers  resellers  or customers 
any such interruption may have a material adverse impact on future results 
since the possibility of such interruptions cannot be eliminated  the company has involved a significant number of cross functional resources with technical  business  legal  and financial expertise in order to achieve year readiness 
in  the company established the worldwide program to address its software and hardware product and customer concerns  its internal business systems  including technology infrastructure and embedded technology systems  and the compliance of its suppliers 
this program includes the following phases identification  assessment  testing  remediation  and contingency planning 
with respect to its products  the company has created categories to describe the status of its products 
more than of the products that the company has considered for testing have been classified as year ready 
the year ready category indicates that the company has determined that the product  when used in its designated manner  will not terminate abnormally or give incorrect results with respect to date data before  during or after december   provided that all products used in conjunction with the avid product accurately exchange formatted information with the avid product 
the company intends to continue testing the majority of the remaining of its designated products and to provide updates such as software patches  workarounds  or other solutions for such designated products where necessary to make them year ready 
in certain cases  for older products  the company has or may deem it inappropriate to test or provide upgrade paths for year readiness 
the readiness status of the company s hardware and software products is available on the company s web site  which is updated from time to time 
this web site has been and will continue to be the company s primary method for communicating information about its products to the public 
because all customer situations cannot be anticipated  the company may see a change in demand or an increase in warranty or service claims as a result of the year transition 
such events  should they occur  could have a material adverse impact on future results 
with respect to the company s efforts to address the year readiness of its internal business systems the identification and assessment phases have  for the most part  been completed  the remainder of these efforts will occur in the second quarter of these identification and assessment phases involved evaluation of substantially all of the company s internal information systems and other infrastructure areas including communication systems  building security systems and embedded technologies in areas such as manufacturing and customer support processes 
testing of certain existing internal information systems is currently underway and is scheduled to be substantially completed in the second quarter of those systems which are already known or are shown not to be year ready are scheduled for remediation during the second or third quarter of remediation may involve upgrades or replacements of non ready systems 
certain of the company s business systems were already scheduled to be replaced in the normal course of business for reasons unrelated to potential year issues 
those systems will be tested for year issues as part of the normal installation and testing process 
the company has initiated communications with mission critical third party suppliers and service providers  such as inventory suppliers  equipment suppliers  financial institutions  landlords  and resellers  to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
suppliers of software  hardware or other products that might contain embedded processors were requested to provide certification regarding the year readiness status of their products and business processes 
suppliers of services were also requested to provide certification or other appropriate information regarding their year readiness status 
for service suppliers who interface with the company via electronic means  the company intends to test mission critical interfaces where possible or appropriate 
in addition  in order to protect against the acquisition of additional products or services that may not be year ready  the company is implementing a policy that requires sufficient assurances that such products and services are year ready 
with respect to the company s resellers  the company has requested or is in the process of requesting from them appropriate assurances regarding year readiness status of their business processes 
the company s efforts with respect to third party suppliers and service providers is scheduled for completion during the second quarter of the company does not anticipate any related delays that will significantly impact its year readiness as a whole 
however  the company does face a risk with respect to third party suppliers who may prove unable to address and remediate their year issues 
the company is developing contingency plans to address the products or services obtained from those third parties who fail to provide the requested information or whose responses are inadequate 
the costs of the readiness program are primarily costs of existing internal resources and expertise combined with small incremental external spending 
the entire cost of the program is estimated at million  of which approximately has been incurred through march  costs for business system replacements or upgrades unrelated to year issues are not included in this estimate 
no future material product readiness costs are anticipated 
however  milestones and implementation dates and the costs of the company s year readiness program are subject to change based on new circumstances that may arise or new information becoming available 
based on the company s ongoing evaluation of internal information and other systems  the company does not anticipate significant business interruptions 
however  satisfactorily addressing a particular year issue on a timely basis is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control  such as those involving third parties 
additionally  there remains the risk that errors or defects related to the year issue may remain undetected 
should business interruptions occur  or should a significant year issue go undetected  there could be a material adverse impact on future results 
european monetary union on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and the euro 
as of that date  the participating countries agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency 
however the legacy currencies will also remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during this transition period  public and private parties may elect to pay or charge for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency 
during  the company developed a plan which includes testing and evaluating system capabilities  determining euro and legacy currency pricing strategies and analyzing the effects on the company s currency exposure and hedging practices 
the company s plan will determine whether the company will be able to process euro denominated transactions such as invoices  purchases  payments and cash receipts  and whether such transactions will be properly translated into the legacy and reporting currencies 
the company does not expect the system and equipment conversion costs to be material 
due to numerous uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the effects one common currency will have  if any  on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
sfas is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after january  for the company  and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following the company recently began shipping its avid symphony product  which is based on intel architecture ia computers and the microsoft windows nt operating system  and its softimage ds and pro tools mix products 
the company expects that a significant portion of its future revenues will be attributable to sales of these newly introduced products 
however  if these products fail to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance  the company s revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company from time to time develops new products or upgraded existing products to incorporate advances in enabling technologies 
for example  the company is continuing to develop additional products that operate using ia based computers and the windows nt operating system 
there can be no assurance that customers will not defer purchases of existing apple based and other products in anticipation of the release of such new products  that the company will be successful in developing additional new products or that they will gain market acceptance  if developed 
any deferral by customers of purchases of existing apple based or other products or any failure by the company to develop such new products in a timely way or to gain market acceptance for them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
certain of the company s products operate only on specific computer platforms 
the company currently relies on apple computer  inc  ibm and intergraph as the sole manufacturers of such computer platforms 
there can be no assurance that customers will not purchase competitors products based on other computer platforms  that the respective manufacturers will continue to develop  manufacture  and support such computer platforms suitable for the company s existing and future markets or that the company will be able to secure an adequate supply of computers  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has expanded its product line to address the digital media production needs of the television broadcast news market  online film and video finishing market and the emerging market for multimedia production tools  including the corporate and home user market 
the company has limited experience in serving these markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop such products successfully  that such products will achieve widespread customer acceptance  or that the company will be able to develop distribution and support channels to serve these markets 
a significant portion of the company s future growth will depend on customer acceptance in these and other new markets 
any failure of such products to achieve market acceptance  additional costs and expenses incurred by the company to improve market acceptance of such products and to develop new distribution and support channels  or the withdrawal from the market of such products or of the company from such new markets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s gross margin may fluctuate based on factors such as the mix of products sold  cost and the proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product and platform upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  the costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with errors or flaws  provisions for inventory obsolescence  allocations of overhead costs to manufacturing and customer support costs to cost of goods  sales of third party computer hardware to its distributors  and competitive pressure on selling prices of products 
the company s systems and software products typically have higher gross margins than storage devices and product upgrades 
gross profit varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
the company  from time to time  adds functionality and features to its systems 
if such additions are accomplished through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and if the company does not increase the price of such systems to offset these increased costs  the company s gross margins on such systems would be adversely affected 
in addition  during  the company installed server based  all digital broadcast newsroom systems at certain customer sites 
some of these systems have been accepted by customers  and the resulting revenues and associated costs were recognized by the company 
others of these systems have not yet been accepted by customers 
the company believes that such installations  when and if fully recognized as revenue on customer acceptance  will be profitable 
however  the company is unable to determine whether and when the systems will be accepted 
in any event  the company believes that  because of the high proportion of third party hardware  including computers and storage devices  included in such systems  the gross margins on such sales will be lower than the gross margins generally on the company s other systems 
the company has shifted an increasing proportion of its sales through indirect channels such as distributors and resellers 
the company believes the overall shift to indirect channels has resulted in an increase in the number of software and circuit board kits sold through indirect channels in comparison with turnkey systems consisting of cpus  monitors  and peripheral devices  including accompanying software and circuit boards  sold by the company through its direct sales force to customers 
resellers and distributors typically purchase software and kits from the company and other turnkey components from other vendor sources in order to produce complete systems for resale 
therefore  to the extent the company increases its sales through indirect channels  its revenue per unit sale will be less than it would have been had the same sale been made directly by the company 
in the event the company is unable to increase the volume of sales in order to offset this decrease in revenue per unit sale or is unable to continue to reduce its costs associated with such sales  profits could be adversely affected 
the company s operating expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
in recent quarters approximately half of the company s revenues for the quarter have been recorded in the third month of the quarter 
further  in many cases  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  the company s operating results may be adversely affected and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to operate profitably 
reductions of certain operating expenses  if incurred  in the face of lower than expected revenues could involve material one time charges associated with reductions in headcount  trimming product lines  eliminating facilities and offices  and writing off certain assets 
the company has significant deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of tax credit and operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
the company is dependent on a number of suppliers as sole source vendors of certain key components of its products and systems 
components purchased by the company from sole source vendors include  video compression chips manufactured by c cube microsystems  a small computer systems interface scsi accelerator board from atto technology  a d digital video effects board from pinnacle systems  application specific integrated circuits asics from chip express and lsi logic  digital signal processing integrated circuits from motorola  a fibre channel adapter card from jni  a fibre channel storage array from data general s clariion division  and a pci expansion chassis from magma inc the company purchases these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
the company also manufactures certain circuit boards under license from truevision a subsidiary of pinnacle systems 
the company generally does not carry significant inventories of these sole source components and has no guaranteed supply arrangements 
no assurance can be given that sole source suppliers will devote the resources necessary to support the enhancement or continued availability of such components or that any such supplier will not encounter technical  operating or financial difficulties that might imperil the company s supply of such sole source components 
while the company believes that alternative sources of supply for sole source components could be developed  or systems redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  its business and results of operations could be materially affected if it were to encounter an untimely or extended interruption in its sources of supply 
the markets for digital media editing and production systems are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
the company encounters competition in the video and film editing and effects and professional audio markets 
many current and potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  and marketing resources than the company 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which the company could not operate profitably 
further  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those of the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in its target markets or that future competition will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar  therefore  could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
the company attempts to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on results through the use of forward exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency denominated intercompany net receivables or payable balances 
the company has generally not hedged transactions with external parties  although it periodically reevaluates its hedging practices 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings  including patent litigation  an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations
