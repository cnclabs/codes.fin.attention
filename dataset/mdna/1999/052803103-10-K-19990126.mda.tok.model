these resources are anticipated to be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital needs for the near term in the normal course of business 
as the company s current cash resources are considered adequate and management believes that similar agreements with similar terms will be available in the future  if necessary  the company s revolving line of credit was allowed to expire on its one year anniversary date 
the company has a liability for restructuring costs incurred prior to the merger in the amount of  at october  the accrued amount provides for the estimated costs related to the closing of certain facilities of triple i 
the liability is being funded through operating cash flows and is expected to be paid in its entirety in fiscal year compliance the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions in operations 
aii s state of readiness 
the company is affected in the processing of data relating to the year and beyond by its own internal computer information systems  by third parties with which it has business relationships and both its current and discontinued products  which are in production usage at customer sites 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software both internally and throughout its produce line will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
for this purpose  the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as information technology it systems 
non it systems refers to other miscellaneous item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued systems  not thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems  fax machines  etc 
both it and non it systems may contain embedded technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the company currently anticipates that its year efforts  which began in january of  will be completed by may the following table sets forth the percentage of completion of the company s year initiatives  as well as the company s progress and anticipated completion dates  as of october  time percent year initiatives table complete internal systems initial it system identification initial it system assessment remediation and testing central system conversion of desktop pcs identification regarding non it issues assessment regarding non it issues product line initial it system identification initial it system assessment remediation and testing information technology it 
in a corporate wide year readiness analysis completed in  individual business units were required to formally develop a plan to achieve year compliance 
each plan consisted of an evaluation of the compliance status of internal it systems and an identification of specific hardware and software compliance issues 
the readiness target date for all business units was december   with units expected to be fully compliant by then 
all business units have completed their reviews and have replaced or modified applications found to be noncompliant 
aii has a number of network connected desktop pcs which are not compliant 
an upgrade program is in place and is expected to be completed by may at an estimated cost of  for testing and replacement 
non it 
with respect to non it issues  a project coordinator is working with the company s facilities management to ensure premises issues are addressed in company owned and leased properties in the united states 
outside of the us  local division managers have been instructed to address this issue 
the company has some risk on a location by location basis related to the possible failure of government agencies  public utilities and providers of telecommunication and transportation services 
due to the company s dispersion of facilities  the largest concentrated risks in this regard are in thousand oaks and boston 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company products 
the company established a policy that all current products be year compliant and that its quality assurance personnel test all new releases of software and hardware for year compliance 
all current product from the company has been successfully tested for year compliance 
the company has published and periodically updated a product compliance list 
users of old  non compliant equipment have been notified 
users operating older revision levels of current products have been notified of the requirement to upgrade  if required 
third parties 
third parties having a material relationship with the company have year issues to address and resolve 
such third parties include suppliers  financial institutions  governmental agencies  telecommunication and insurance carriers 
an aspect of the company s project is to identify the third parties and contact them to seek written assurance as to the third parties anticipation of being year compliant 
the nature of the company s follow up depends upon its assessment of the reason and the materiality of the effect of non compliance by third parties on the company 
during  compliance questionnaires were sent to all major suppliers and other third parties with whom the company does business 
as of october   of major suppliers have responded with responding they are compliant and in the process of becoming year complaint 
further follow up efforts are being made for the that have not replied and alternative year compliant suppliers are being identified 
in addition  compliance questionnaires were also sent to other third parties the company does business with  such as financial institutions  telecommunications and insurance companies 
a response rate of close to has been achieved  with approximately of respondents indicating they are year complaint and the remaining in the process of becoming compliant with a deadline of no later than mid however  the company has no means of ensuring that such third parties will be year ready 
the inability of third parties to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by third parties is not determinable 
costs to address aii s year issues 
the company s year remediation costs for all business units are projected to be approximately  at this time  the company s actual and estimated future costs for internal systems and its product lines are as follows item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued costs estimated total through future costs costs internal systems hardware    software    total    product line hardware    software    total    total company    included in the actual costs through october  under internal systems software is the cost of a new corporate business system of  which was installed during fiscal years and and which has been capitalized 
in addition to addressing year issues  the business system was installed to streamline the company s operations and provide better management information 
except for hardware costs  all other costs will be expensed as incurred 
risks of the company s year issues 
the company s management believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in addition  disruption in the economy in general resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
all company internal systems are currently year compliant except for a number of network connected pcs previously mentioned 
in addition  the company has thoroughly reviewed its product line to assist its customers with the year issue 
the company believes that its current products are year compliant and no additional costs or expenses are anticipated under warranties or to service such products except for the development of certain testing hardware and computer software which it presently estimates will cost approximately  to develop 
the company believes that a majority of its discontinued products are also year compliant 
however  certain of its older products  the sale for which were discontinued several years ago  may not be year compliant 
the company believes such products are not under warranty and the company does not intend to renew its one year service contracts as they relate to these older products or products of others that it services which are not year compliant 
in most cases  the company offers a new  year compliant product which can be purchased as a replacement for the older product that is not year compliant  along with annual maintenance agreements 
the company s contingency plans 
although the company believes both its internal systems and product line are year compliant  contingency plans have been made 
preparations are in process to have a team of technicians available to assist customers with software and hardware which may have year bugs not revealed until after december  despite testing 
the company anticipates handling these situations with immediate program fixes  swapped backup hardware or process work around 
the company does not anticipate that problems of this nature will be significant due to thorough testing of its product line and advance notification to its customers 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of the euro several european countries have adopted  and others are expected to adopt  a single european currency the euro as of january  with a transition period continuing through january  the company is reviewing the anticipated impact the euro may have on its internal systems and on its competitive environment 
the company believes its internal systems will be euro capable without material modification cost 
further  the company does not expect the introduction of the euro currency to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements refer to forward looking statement disclosure on page 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and derivative financial instruments 
aii maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
given the short term nature of these investments  and that the company has no borrowings outstanding  the company is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a significant portion of aii s operations consists of sales activities in foreign locations as the company sells its products worldwide 
the company s financial results  therefore  could be significantly impacted by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since all of aii s sales are denominated in us dollars  the company s foreign operations are net payers of currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by the impacts of weaker foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on its foreign currency based expenses and receivables  the company purchases foreign currency option contracts to hedge the adverse impact of currency fluctuations on its foreign currency receivables and firm commitments
