maintaining a high level of quality service  sanitation and food preparation is labor intensive 
a tight labor market will continue to contribute to general wage inflation 
congress is considering various increases in the federal minimum wage to be mandated in the coming years 
higher wages make it difficult for the company to control labor and related costs unless the sales trend improvement continues 
the company will consider price increases and other methods to compensate for labor cost increases

the valuation allowance currently offsets the full amount of deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities 
despite the valuation allowance  the deferred tax assets are still available to the company for future use 
if the company maintains profitability  the company may recognize tax benefits for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets at a future date  when the valuation allowance is reduced or the tax assets realized 
the deferred tax assets include federal employer tax credits and net operating loss nol carryforwards which expire in years through  and state nol carryforwards which expire in years through due to the factors discussed above  the company reported net earnings of million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share

year impact some computer hardware and software use only two digits to identify the year in date information 
if not corrected  such systems could fail when processing dates for the year or later 
the company is in the process of updating its computer hardware and software to properly process year and later dates 
the company has identified all significant hardware and software that it believes will require modification to provide year processing compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and test year processing 
the key company systems for which year problems might pose a significant risk are the company s restaurant point of sale pos register systems and the company s corporate accounting system 
in october and november  the company replaced its primary existing pos software with a newer version provided by the same vendor at no charge 
during this process  the company also installed or upgraded its restaurant pos hardware to accommodate year dates 
the hardware upgrade and software installation costs of about  were capitalized in fiscal  and the company expensed about  in fiscal to train employees on the new software 
as of november   four of the company s restaurants were still using an older pos software and hardware system 
the company s tests indicate that these older systems will properly process dates in the year the company installed the year compliant version of its corporate accounting software in october although the upgrade was provided at no charge by the vendor  in the company recorded about  in programming expenses to modify custom programs related to the accounting software update 
we estimate the company may incur an additional  to complete such modifications in fiscal based on its testing and vendors representations  the company believes that its pos systems and corporate accounting systems will properly process year dates 
in addition  the company has communicated with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year readiness and the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to third party year problems 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will be converted timely  or that a failure to convert by another company will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from those plans 
other uncertainties and trends in recent years  there has been accelerated development of value priced menus and all you can eat restaurant offerings 
pancho s mexican buffet has operated as a value priced  all you can eat concept for over years and expects to compete effectively
