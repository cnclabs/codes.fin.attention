see provision for restructuring included below 
the following is a discussion of factors affecting results of operations for the years ended december   and net revenues consolidated net revenues in were  an increase of  or from the increase was principally due to higher revenues in both the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments 
domestic revenues  which consist principally of revenues from the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments  increased  and foreign revenues decreased compared to the decline in foreign revenues resulted primarily from decreased unit volume for our ceramic products 
grafton r dbm segment revenues in were  an increase of  or compared with the prior year  as a result of increased demand for grafton r dbm 
base tissue segment revenues were  or higher than prior year revenues of  as a result of the increased unit volume of allograft bone tissue which we processed for our clients 
consolidated net revenues in were  an increase of  or over consolidated net revenues of  the increase was principally due to higher revenues in the grafton r dbm segment  which increased to  from  in  as a result of increased demand for grafton r dbm 
domestic revenues  which consist principally of revenues from the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments  increased and foreign revenues decreased compared to the decline in foreign revenues resulted primarily from a decrease in research grant revenues from the dutch government  as a result of the discontinuance of our polyactive tm polymer research and development program 
see provision for restructuring below 
during  we licensed out the patents and technology related to polyactive tm and received an upfront payment of  which partially offset the decline in grant revenues 
additionally  foreign revenues in were unfavorably impacted as a result of the strength of the us dollar compared to the dutch guilder 
however  the impact on consolidated net revenues was approximately 
base tissue segment revenues decreased in as compared with in  we discontinued providing certain contract testing services to one of our clients  which accounted for this decrease in revenues 
during  and  two of our clients in the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments accounted for and  and and and  respectively  of consolidated net revenues 
effective in  we entered into new long term exclusive processing agreements with both of these clients 
costs of services and products costs of services as a percentage of service revenues was in  in and in the decline in costs as a percentage of revenues results from a shift in revenue mix toward services with higher gross margins  operating efficiencies resulting from increased volume and an increase in fees charged to our clients for grafton r dbm 
we expect that consolidated costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues will increase approximately in as a result of increased processing expenses associated with the implementation of viral inactivation technology in the base tissue segment 
cost of products as a percentage of product revenues was in  in and in the increase in costs in as a percentage of revenues resulted principally from a decrease in revenues from certain ceramic products and non allograft bone tissue spinal implant products  while fixed costs remained the same 
the decline in costs as a percentage of revenue in resulted primarily from a shift in product mix toward products with higher gross margins 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased  or in and  or in the increases are primarily attributable to the grafton r dbm segment and result from expanded marketing and promotional activities and increased agent commissions resulting from increased volume 
additionally  corporate administrative costs increased compared with  principally as a result of higher outside professional costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in increased  or to  from  in the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending in the base tissue segment associated with the continued development of a viral inactivation process and development of allograft tissue products and services  including the bio d tm threaded cortical bone dowel 
research and development expenses in decreased  or to  from  in the decline results principally from the discontinuance of our polyactive tm polymer research and development program in the fourth quarter of see provision for restructuring below 
provision for restructuring in october  we announced a plan to restructure our operations located in leiden  the netherlands in order to focus those operations on i providing ceramic and titanium spray coating services and ceramic products to the orthopaedic and dental markets and ii to pursue oem business opportunities for those technologies 
in connection with the restructuring  we discontinued our polyactive tm polymer research and development program 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of  which included  for employee termination costs   for write off of equipment  intangible assets and inventory   for costs associated with the planned sub leasing of office space in leiden on which we have a long term lease  and  for other contractual obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income operating income increased  or in and  or in the increase in both periods results primarily from improved operating income in the grafton r dbm segment resulting from increased revenues discussed above 
grafton r dbm segment operating income increased  or in and  or in operating income in also improved as a result of the restructuring of the foreign operations in see provision for restructuring above 
other income expense in and  other income increased by  and  compared to and  respectively  due to higher invested cash and lower outstanding debt balances 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in and and in the high effective income tax rate in was principally due to foreign losses for which no current tax benefits were available 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and short term investments of  compared to  at december  we invest our excess cash in us government backed securities and investment grade commercial paper of major us corporations 
working capital increased  to  at december  compared to  at december  accounts receivable at december  increased  due to revenue increases 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in the increase resulted primarily from improved earnings in  partly offset by the increase in accounts receivable discussed above and an increase in deferred processing costs 
cash used for capital expenditures in was  and resulted from our continued investment in facilities and equipment needed for current and future business requirements 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced construction of a new processing facility in eatontown  new jersey 
see item properties 
the estimated aggregate cost for the construction of the facility  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  is approximately  of which  we expect will be funded by our current bank through a building mortgage loan and equipment line of credit 
the remaining balance of  will be funded through available cash reserves or anticipated cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in both periods include proceeds from stock option exercises and tax benefits resulting from these stock option exercises 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is net of  used to repurchase and retire  shares of our common stock in we presently have a loan and security agreement with a us bank  which provides for borrowings of up to  under a revolving line of credit and  under an equipment line of credit 
at december    was outstanding under the equipment line of credit and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the existing credit facility will be replaced in with a new credit facility that will include a  revolving line of credit in addition to the  building mortgage loan and equipment line of credit discussed above 
consummation of the new credit facility is subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement 
we also have a line of credit with a dutch bank  which provides for borrowings of up to dfl  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
analysis of our cash position and anticipated cash flow indicated that it most likely would not be necessary to utilize a significant portion of this line of credit in and  therefore  we agreed with the bank to limit our borrowings  if any  to no more than dfl  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit line 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  certain of our foreign based subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating  at the december  exchange rate  with no expiration date   expiring through 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and available lines of credit  together with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our near term requirements 
from time to time  we may seek additional funds through equity or debt financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available to us or  if available  that such funds will be available to us on favorable terms 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
litigation osteotech is involved in various legal proceedings involving product liability and patent infringement claims 
for a complete discussion of these matters  see item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
year we recognize the need to ensure that year issues will not adversely impact our operations and have identified our potential year risk in three categories internal business software and hardware  internal non financial systems  and noncompliance by suppliers and customers 
internal business software and hardware several years ago we determined that our existing business information systems were not adequate to support the anticipated growth in our business operations and as a result purchased a fully integrated management information system  which is year compliant 
most of the new system is operational at this time and the remainder of the system is scheduled to be operational in june the completion cost for implementation of the remaining software is not expected to be material 
all related hardware used to support internal business software is currently year compliant 
as a result  we do not believe that we require a contingency plan with respect to our internal business systems  and therefore have not developed one 
however  if we subsequently identify significant risks we will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time 
internal non financial systems we have completed our assessment of our internal non financial systems  such as office equipment  security systems and other business equipment  and determined that minimal changes are required for year compliance 
we expect to be in full compliance with our internal non financial systems before the year and the cost to achieve such compliance is not expected to be material 
noncompliance by suppliers and customers we have initiated written communications with all of our significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which we are vulnerable to those third parties failure to achieve year compliance 
we are currently evaluating the responses and  if there are any affected suppliers and or customers  will develop contingency plans in order to minimize disruption to our business operations 
at this time we cannot estimate the additional cost  if any  that may result from such contingency plans 
risk of non compliance based on the progress we have made in addressing year issues  we do not foresee significant risks associated with our year compliance program at this time 
although we expect to be compliant before the year  there is no guarantee that these results will be achieved 
partial or total business systems interruption or the inability of a significant supplier or customer to achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business operations  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
risk factors two primary clients provide the bulk of our revenues we are the exclusive processor of allograft bone tissue for large national and international not for profit organizations 
during  mtf and arc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
we entered into a year exclusive processing agreement with arc in december and a five year exclusive processing agreement with mtf in april the loss of either mtf or arc as a client or a substantial reduction in the amount of allograft bone tissue which we process for either entity would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence upon a limited supply of human donors may curtail business expansion our allograft bone tissue processing business depends upon the availability of bone and related connective tissue from human donors recovered by our clients 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies  including our current clients  to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to find a sufficient number of persons to donate sufficient amounts of tissue to meet present or future demand for either allograft bone tissue or any allograft bone tissue based osteogenic materials we are developing 
in the event that we are unable to secure enough donors to meet our demands  our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect 
our revenues will depend upon reimbursement from public and private insurers the continued ability of our clients to pay our processing charges depends upon our clients ability to distribute processed allograft bone tissue and collect fees from their clients  which are typically medical institutions 
the ability of medical institutions to pay fees to our clients depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
we may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for our products and services if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
medical community could choose not to use our allograft bone tissue products we believe the market for allograft bone tissue will continue to derive from the use of such products by physicians specializing in the orthopaedic  neurological  plastic and oral maxillofacial surgical areas 
our future growth depends in part upon such physicians wider use of allograft bone tissue as an alternative to autograft bone tissue and other available materials and treatments 
we have tried to educate physicians through our marketing activities 
although our education and marketing efforts to date have enabled us to expand our business  our future efforts in this regard may fail to generate additional demand 
governmental regulation of organ transplantation could restrict the use of our products the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue are subject to federal regulation pursuant to nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
we provide services in all of these areas  with the exception of removal and implantation 
osteotech and other allograft bone tissue processors are engaged in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of processed allograft bone tissue and we will continue to expand our educational activities 
although we believe that nota permits reimbursement of these costs as costs associated with the processing  transportation and implantation of our allograft bone tissue products  our inability to be reimbursed for our education efforts in the future could adversely affect our business and prospects 
no federal agency or court has determined whether nota is  or will be  applicable to every allograft bone tissue based material which our processing technologies may generate 
assuming that nota applies to osteotech s processing of allograft bone tissue  we believe that we comply with nota  but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of  or amendments to  nota will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations 
loss of key persons could limit our success our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of our key personnel  particularly members of senior management  could adversely affect our business 
inability to enforce our patents or findings that we infringe patents held by others could damage our business osteotech considers its allograft bone tissue processing technology and procedures proprietary and relies primarily on trade secrets and patents to protect its technology and innovations 
consultants employed by third parties and persons working in conjunction with medical institutions unaffiliated with us have conducted significant research and development for our products 
accordingly  disputes may arise concerning the proprietary rights to information applied to our projects which have been independently developed by such consultants or medical institutions 
in addition  you should recognize that although we have attempted to protect our technology with patents  our existing patents may prove invalid or unenforceable as to products or services marketed by our competitors 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  due to continuous changes as a result of research and development  we could inadvertently infringe the patents of others 
we are currently involved in two lawsuits in which we are accused of infringing patents held by others 
see item legal proceedings 
firms with greater financial resources and lower costs present strong competitive threat the allograft bone tissue we process competes in the bone graft market with autograft bone tissue  synthetic bone void fillers and allograft bone tissue processed by others  primarily tissue banks 
autograft bone tissue has traditionally been the primary choice for surgeons and we believe autograft bone tissue still maintains approximately share of the united states bone graft market 
certain of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
for numerous circumstances and procedures for which autograft bone tissue transplantation is either not feasible or not desirable  there are a number of competing alternatives available  including allograft bone tissue processed by others 
we believe that a majority of the cadaveric bone banks operating in the united states are engaged in processing allograft bone tissue for transplantation 
substantially all of these bone tissue banks are not for profit organizations  and  as such  they may be able to supply processing services at a lower cost than we can 
we compete with such entities on the basis of our advanced processing technology and the quality and quantity of the bone tissue our processing yields 
since we introduced our allograft bone tissue processing technology in  certain competing processors have claimed to have developed technology similar to that which we use 
although we believe  based upon our knowledge of the industry  that we process bone tissue from more donors than any other processor in the world  there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete successfully in the area of allograft bone tissue processing 
competitive threat from alternate technologies the primary advantage of synthetic bone substitutes is that they do not depend on the availability of human donors 
in addition  members of the medical community and the general public may perceive synthetic materials as safer than allograft based bone tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process may be incapable of competing successfully with synthetic bone substitutes and recombinant bone growth factors which are developed and commercialized by others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk to spray coating and ha product operations of competition our plasma spray coating and ha product operations face competition in europe from divisions and subsidiaries of several large corporations engaged in providing such services and products to others and from several smaller independent companies 
in addition  we also face competition from medical implant companies which have in house plasma spray coating operations 
we compete primarily on the quality of our coatings and our prices 
we believe that the spraying technology we use  which is computer controlled and utilizes robotics  enables us to provide high quality coatings at competitive prices 
you should note  however  that the ceramic coating industry is highly competitive  certain of our competitors have greater resources than we do  and we may be unable to compete successfully 
potential losses from product liability lawsuits the testing and use of human allograft bone tissue and the implantation of medical devices coated with our ha powder or titanium and medical devices manufactured by others and which we distribute  entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and therefore may result in product liability claims against us 
further  our agreements with our allograft bone tissue processing clients provide for indemnification by us for liabilities arising out of defects in allograft bone tissue caused by our processing 
as a distributor of implants and instruments for spinal surgery  including bone screws  manufactured by ulrich  we are currently named as a defendant in two lawsuits in which patients claim that they have suffered damages from the implantation of allegedly defective spinal fixation devices 
although we believe that we will ultimately prevail in these cases  litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the pending cases could be decided against us 
the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or the costs of contesting such suits could materially adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources if the ultimate liability exceeds the amount that we recover from ulrich pursuant to ulrich s indemnification obligation to us 
we are unable to estimate the potential liability  if any  that may result from the pending litigation and  accordingly  have made no provision for any possible future liability in the consolidated financial statements 
see item legal proceedings 
we presently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and per year in the aggregate 
we may be unable to maintain such insurance in the future and such insurance may not cover all liabilities 
potential lawsuit or governmental enforcement based on hazardous waste our bone tissue processing generates waste which is classified as medical hazardous waste by the united states environmental protection agency and the new jersey department of environmental protection 
we segregate such waste and dispose of it through a licensed hazardous waste transporter in compliance with applicable regulations 
the production of ha powder at our facility in the netherlands generates small amounts of hazardous waste  which we segregate and dispose of through a licensed hazardous waste transporter 
although we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations  our failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  fines and or sanctions or  in some cases  private lawsuits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
