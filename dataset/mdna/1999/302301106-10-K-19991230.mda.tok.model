for fiscal  gross margins decreased percentage points from fiscal to 
of the total decrease  percentage points were attributable to a decline in margins on merchandise sales and of a percentage point were attributable to an increase in inventory shrinkage 
during  the company reduced its merchandise pricing and loan guidelines in response to a reduction in competitive retail prices  primarily in jewelry and electronics 
as a result of the impact these market changes had on the business  the company increased its inventory valuation reserve by million  with a corresponding net charge to cost of goods sold  accounting for percentage points of the percentage point decrease in gross margins on merchandise sales 
the remaining percentage point decrease in gross margins on merchandise sales was largely the result of the retail price reductions 
in addition  an increase of of a percentage point in inventory shrinkage when measured as a percent of merchandise sales  increasing inventory shrinkage to  further contributed to the lower total gross margin 
the company believes that higher employee turnover in some of its markets may have contributed to the higher inventory shrinkage 
as a result of the reduction in competitive prices discussed above  the company s loan customers changed their perceived value of collateral relative to the company s loan amount 
the result on the company s business was a decline in loan redemption rates from in fiscal and fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in redemption rate coupled with loan growth contributed to an increase in inventory created through loan forfeitures that exceeded merchandise sales growth 
consequently  per store inventory levels increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the company s reaction to these market changes and inventory growth was to reduce its loan amount and retail prices on certain categories of merchandise 
the company believes that these changes will slow loan growth and reduce gross margins on merchandise sales in future periods relative to the prior year period

in fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased of a percentage point from fiscal to primarily as a result of increased new store openings 
administrative expenses decreased of a percentage point from fiscal to primarily as a result of the economies realized from revenue growth and a reduction in management bonuses earned in fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation and amortization expense  when measured as a percent of total revenue  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is a net effect of greater revenues and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to investments made in new stores  and the company s information systems 
in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense declined to from in fiscal the decline was a combined effect of greater revenues and an absolute decline in depreciation and amortization  as the impact of assets becoming fully depreciated during the year outweighed the impact of asset additions 
in fiscal  interest expense increased million to million 
in fiscal  interest expense increased to million from million in fiscal the increased interest expense in each year was due largely to increased average debt balances resulting from additional borrowings to fund new store expansion

the year issue the company  like many companies  faces the year issue 
this is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four for example  for to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involved the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all systems that could be affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that the only information technology system affected was the company s store level point of sale system 
for this exposure  the company has completed the assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation phases 
in addition  the company has reviewed and continues to monitor the year preparedness of third parties with which it transacts business 
the company is not aware of any third party with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that all third parties will be year ready 
the company utilized internal resources to reprogram  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project was less than  and was funded by operating cash flows 
these costs were expensed as incurred 
the company s management believes it has effectively resolved the year issue 
if unexpected issues arise  the company may not be able to process customer transactions which could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
as a contingency plan  the company has developed and distributed to each of its locations an operating package which would allow each location to operate in a manual environment 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal declined to million compared to million provided in fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in the company s inventory  partially offset by smaller changes in other working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million provided in fiscal improved operating results offset by increases in inventories and pawn service charges receivable were the main factors for the increased cash provided by operating activities 
in fiscal  the company invested million in pawn loans  million in property  plant  and equipment  primarily for new stores  million in albemarle and bond holdings plc  an unconsolidated affiliate of the company  and million to acquire four pawn stores 
these investments  the payment of million in dividends  and a million increase in cash balances were funded by a net million increase in bank borrowings and the million provided by operating activities 
the company plans to slow its store expansion in fiscal and open approximately new stores 
during fiscal  the company plans to complete a sale leaseback transaction of some of its owned properties 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations  funds available under its existing bank line of credit  and proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction will be adequate to fund planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the coming year 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s planned sale leaseback transaction will be completed or that the company s cash flow from operating activities  and funds available under the line of credit will be adequate for these expenditures 
on december   the company completed a new million syndicated credit facility and amended this facility the first amendment on september  the first amendment increased the leverage ratio covenant for the fiscal quarters ending september  and december  and provided for a decrease in the fixed charge coverage covenant in the quarter that the planned sale leaseback transaction is completed and the following quarter 
the new credit facility as amended is unsecured and matures december  terms of the credit agreement require  among other things  that the company meet certain financial covenants 
the outstanding balance under the facility bears interest  payable monthly  at the agent bank s prime rate or eurodollar rate plus to basis points  depending on certain performance criteria 
in addition  the company pays an unused commitment fee equal to a fixed rate of basis points of the unused amount of the total commitment 
at december   the company had million outstanding on the line of credit 
seasonality historically  pawn service charge revenues are highest in the company s fiscal fourth quarter july  august  and september due to higher loan demand during the summer months and merchandise sales are highest in the company s first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and tax refunds
