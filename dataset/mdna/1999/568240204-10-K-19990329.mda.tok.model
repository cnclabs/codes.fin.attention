item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry overview demand for the company s offshore drilling services is primarily driven by the worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling which is closely linked to the underlying economics of oil and gas exploration  development and production 
the economics of oil and gas business activities is impacted by current and projected oil and gas prices 
since the early s  oil and gas prices have been volatile and somewhat unpredictable  which has caused significant fluctuations in oil and gas drilling expenditures 
many factors influence oil and gas prices  including world economic conditions  worldwide oil and gas production and the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
the rates that the industry can charge for drilling services is a function of not only demand for services but the supply of drilling rigs available in the market to provide service 
during the early s when oil and gas prices were high and significant demand for drilling services existed  the industry built a significant number of offshore drilling rigs 
in the mid s when oil and gas prices declined significantly and the corresponding demand for drilling services declined  the supply of drilling rigs was significantly greater than the industry needed 
this resulted in an imbalance of supply and demand causing low utilization with dayrates declining to virtually cash operating costs 
during and early  oil and gas prices rose to a level that stimulated significant oil and gas drilling activity resulting in improved utilization and dayrates for the drilling industry 
however  oil and gas prices have declined significantly since october  and have reached multi year lows in various markets in recent months 
as a result  oil and gas companies have made significant cutbacks in their drilling programs 
this has reduced industry wide rig utilization including the us gulf of mexico  where the company operates most of its rigs  which has not only sharply reduced dayrates  but also shortened the average length of drilling contracts 
the following table sets forth current rig utilization rates and average utilization rates for  and  according to offshore data services as of march  gulf of mexico jack up rigs worldwide jack up rigs worldwide semi submersible rigs as of march   nine of the company s jack up rigs are committed under short term contracts that will expire in the first or second quarter of  one rig is under contract for one year  and the remaining rigs are idle 
all of the currently committed rigs are in the us gulf of mexico 
the company currently has no international rigs working 
in addition to the recent declines in rig utilization  current dayrates for drilling rigs are substantially less than the dayrates that generally prevailed during most of these current market conditions will adversely affect the company s results of operations for at least the near term  substantially reducing its revenues  cash flows and earnings and likely resulting in losses in until the marine and the marine begin operations 
oil and gas prices may continue to deteriorate  and the company cannot predict whether or when they might recover 
results of operations the number of rigs the company has available for service and the utilization rates and dayrates of the company s active rigs are the most significant factors affecting the company s level of revenues 
operating costs include all direct costs and expenditures associated with operating the company s rigs 
these costs include rig labor  repair  maintenance and supply expenditures  insurance costs  mobilization costs and other costs related to operations 
operating expenses do not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues due to the cost of maintaining personnel on board the rigs and equipment maintenance when the rigs are idle 
labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and inflation 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the rig is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
inflation is another contributing factor in the fluctuation of operating expenses 
the changes in operating income are more directly affected by revenue factors than expense factors since changes in dayrates directly impact revenues but not expenses 
utilization rate changes have a significant impact on revenues  but in the short term do not impact expenses 
over a long period significant changes in utilization may cause the company to adjust the level of its actively marketed rig fleet and labor force to match anticipated levels of demand  thus changing the level of operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses do not vary significantly unless the company materially expands its asset base 
depreciation  which is affected by the company s level of capital expenditures and depreciation practices is another major determinant of operating income  and is not affected by changes in dayrates or utilization 
the following table sets forth the average rig utilization rates  operating days  average day rates  revenues and operating expenses of the company by operating segments for the periods indicated dollars in thousands except per day data for the years ended december  jack ups operating days    utilization average revenue per day    revenue    contract drilling expense    depreciation    operating income    semi submersibles operating days utilization average revenue per day   revenue   contract drilling expense   depreciation   operating income   total company operating days    utilization average revenue per day    revenue    contract drilling expense    depreciation    general and administrative expense    operating income    based on the number of actively marketed rigs 
excluding rigs under construction or in the process of substantial upgrading  the company had an average of   and non marketed rigs during  and  respectively 
excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses 
the company did not operate any semi submersibles prior to years ended december  and revenues 
the company s drilling revenues increased  or  compared to the increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in average daily revenue to  an increase of operating days in also contributed to the increased revenues due to placing the marine into service in august and the marine in may partially offsetting these increases was a decline in rig utilization to in from in costs and expenses 
contract drilling expenses in increased  or compared to the increase was primarily a result of increased fleet size in the international market 
the marine was placed into service in august and the marine in may international rig operations typically have higher average operating costs than domestic rig operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased  from  to  compared to the same period in the increase in was due to a full year of depreciation in associated with expenditures for the acquisition of the marine and upgrade of the marine general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  in from  in the increase was attributed to an increase in professional services and increased personnel costs consistent with the increased level of operations  new deepwater contracts and increased international activity 
interest expense 
interest expense for was  compared to  during the decrease was primarily the result of the prepayment and termination of the company s million credit facility in february interest income 
interest income decreased  or from  in to  in the decrease was related primarily to decreased cash balances throughout the year as a result of expenditures related to the company s two major construction and upgrade projects 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased for as compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in the company s pretax income 
years ended december  and revenues 
the company s drilling revenues increased  or  compared to revenue increases from jack up drilling operations accounted for  of the increase 
this increase was mainly attributable to increased day rates and slightly better utilization in compared to and the activation of the marine during august in southeast asia that contributed  to the increase 
the remaining  increase in revenues was from placing the marine  the company s first semi submersible  into service the beginning of costs and expenses 
contract drilling expenses in increased  or compared to contract drilling expenses in of the  increase   can be attributed to jack up drilling operations 
the addition of the marine was responsible for  of the increase 
labor costs due to higher salaries and additional personnel along with increased maintenance costs partially offset by decreases in employer s liability claims accounted for the remaining  attributed to jack up operations 
the remaining increase in operating costs of  is due to the operation of the company s semi submersible rig the marine which began operating during the first quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased  from  to  compared to the same period in the increase was due to depreciation associated with expenditures for the following items i the acquisition of the marine  ii acquisition of the marine  iii upgrades to the marine and the marine  and iv acquisitions of drill string and other drilling equipment 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in increased  or from  in to  the increase was attributed to an increase in professional services and other administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense in was  the company had interest expense of  during the decrease was primarily the result of the prepayment and termination of the company s million credit facility in february interest income 
interest income increased  or from  in to  in the increase was related primarily to increased cash balances throughout the year  and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased for as compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in the company s pretax income 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
at december   the company had working capital of  as compared to working capital of  at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased by  to  compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increased dayrates and rig operating activity coupled with the timing of cash receipts and payments 
cash used in investing activities increased  in to  from  in due to  of capital expenditures  which were primarily related to the construction of the marine and the marine upgrade 
net cash provided by financing activities during was  consisting primarily of  in proceeds from long term debt borrowings 
in march  the company entered into a credit agreement credit facility with certain banks providing financing up to million to be used for rig acquisitions and upgrades 
this agreement included a revolving credit facility available through december  at which point  it converted into a four year term loan 
the credit facility called for interest and facility fees to be paid quarterly during the terms of both facilities 
the term loan facility provided for equal quarterly principal payments beginning march  interest accrues at a rate of i libor plus a margin of 
to or ii prime plus a margin of to  with margins determined pursuant to a debt to capital calculation 
the borrowings were secured by all of the company s rig fleet  except for the marine  as well as certain other assets 
in connection with the consummation of the credit facility  the company repaid and terminated its former million credit facility with a us financial institution 
on august   the company entered into an agreement the amended credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks  which amends the credit facility to a five year revolver maturing august  eliminates the term loan conversion feature and increases the credit line to million 
the amended credit facility is now secured by substantially all of the company s assets  including its rig fleet 
the company and its subsidiaries are required to satisfy customary lending conditions and comply with various covenants and restrictions  including  but not limited to  the maintenance of financial ratios and the restriction on payments of dividends 
interest accrues at a rate of i libor plus a margin of 
to with margins determined pursuant to a debt to ebitda calculation or ii prime if a base rate loan 
the company drew down million on the facility during the fourth quarter of if currently depressed market conditions continue  the company expects that it will incur losses and substantially reduced ebitda in until the marine and the marine begin operations 
in addition  the company has been substantially increasing its indebtedness under the amended credit facility to fund construction costs on the marine and the marine approximately million was outstanding on march  
as a result  unless there is a significant near term improvement in market conditions  the company  later in  will likely be unable to satisfy the ratio of indebtedness to ebitda financial covenant in the amended credit facility 
this covenant requires the ratio of indebtedness to ebitda for the twelve month period ending on any given date  to be greater than to under the amended credit facility  the company s failure to satisfy this covenant would give the banks the right to accelerate any outstanding amounts 
the company anticipates that the banks will  if needed  grant the company a limited waiver from this covenant in part due to the company s expectation of satisfying this covenant after the marine and marine are generating revenues under their existing contracts for several months 
there cannot be any assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain any necessary bank waivers  or that any such breach of this financial covenant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
during  the improvement in the offshore drilling market allowed the company to place some of its offshore rigs under longer term contracts 
in july  the company entered into a contract for the marine that expires on december  and is expected to produce total revenues of approximately million beginning may  upon completion of a million upgrade to enable the rig to operate in water depths up to  feet 
in december  the company entered into a nine month contract for the marine that commenced mid may and was expected to generate revenues of million 
the marine is being chartered from shanghai bureau of marine geological survey for a period of five years 
charter fees are payable only when the rig is under contract 
the contract included an early termination clause  which allowed the customer to terminate the contract in mid november for a fee of approximately million 
the early termination caused the company to realize only approximately million in revenues from the contract 
in january  the company obtained a three year contract with an option to extend to a five year term for the marine in june the customer exercised the option and extended the contract to five years 
the contract is expected to generate aggregate dayrate revenues of approximately million over its five year term  which is scheduled to begin late in the second quarter of upon completion of the construction of marine see construction of marine discussion below 
the contract also allows the customer to terminate the contract if the rig is not available by july   unless such delay is caused by the customer or any of its subcontractors 
construction of marine in december  the company entered into an agreement whereby ham marine  inc ham would complete construction of the marine semi submersible drilling rig in their shipyard in pascagoula  mississippi for million 
the shipyard contract calls for ham to fabricate certain components of the rig and install certain drilling equipment provided by the company owner furnished equipment or ofe 
the shipyard contract calls for monthly progress payments based on the percent complete 
the company originally estimated that the ofe would cost approximately million including capitalized interest and other project management costs resulting in a total estimated cost to complete the drilling rig of million 
construction of the rig has progressed since the signing of the shipyard contract and through december   the company has paid ham approximately million in progress payments and paid approximately million for ofe and other related construction costs 
the shipyard contract initially contemplated a delivery date of february  however  due to engineering  construction  weather and other delays  the expected completion date for the marine is now late second quarter additionally  the anticipated construction and outfitting cost has increased to approximately million 
included in the million increase over the original cost estimate are the cost of change orders initiated by esso  the company s customer 
current estimates for the cost of these change orders is approximately million  which the company will recover through an increase in the dayrate during the term of the five year drilling contract of approximately  per day 
see business construction and contract risks for discussion of risks associated with the marine contracts 
marine upgrade 
in december  the company signed a contract with jurong to upgrade the marine to fourth generation capabilities for approximately million 
change orders have now increased the shipyard costs to approximately million 
in addition to this million  the company currently estimates that the ofe will cost approximately million  including capitalized interest and project management costs  resulting in a total estimated cost to complete the drilling rig of million 
through december   the company has paid jurong approximately million in progress payments and paid approximately million for ofe and other related construction costs 
the contract anticipated that the rig would arrive in the singapore shipyard on july  and be completed by december  since the marine did not arrive in the shipyard until october  due to an extension of work under its previous drilling contract  the company now expects to complete construction of the marine during the second quarter of see business construction and contract risks for discussion of risks associated with the marine contracts 
capital resources 
during the year ended december  the company expended million in capital expenditures consisting primarily of disbursements for i the completion of the marine  ii the upgrade of the marine  iii acquisition of the marine and iv the purchase of drill pipe and other rig machinery 
in december  the company acquired the marine formerly the maersk explorer  a jack up rig currently configured as an accommodation unit for approximately million 
currently  the rig is idle and is located in rotterdam 
the company anticipates marketing the rig as an accommodation unit 
if market conditions warrant  the rig can be upgraded to competitive drilling status for approximately million 
an upgrade could be completed in approximately nine months 
if upgraded  the rig will be outfitted with the drilling equipment removed from the marine during its upgrade and will be capable of operating in the north sea 
the company expects to spend approximately million in for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of expenditures to upgrade and complete the marine and marine the company will continue to pursue acquisitions of additional drilling rigs and related equipment and or businesses 
future acquisitions  if any  would likely be funded from the company s working capital  the amended credit facility or through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
the company cannot predict whether it will be successful in acquiring additional rigs  and obtaining financing therefor  on acceptable terms 
in addition  it is currently anticipated that the company will continue the upgrading of rigs to enhance their capability to obtain longer term contracts 
the timing and actual amounts expended by the company in connection with its plans to upgrade and refurbish selected rigs  as well as the type of rig modification comprising each program  is subject to the discretion of the company and will depend on the company s view of market conditions  the company s cash flow  whether other acquisitions are made  and other factors 
the company anticipates that its available funds  together with cash generated from operations and amounts that may be borrowed under the amended credit facility and other potential funding sources  such as increased credit facilities and private or public debt or equity offerings  will be sufficient to fund its required capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
future cash flows  however  are subject to a number of uncertainties  especially the condition of the oil and gas industry 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that these resources will be sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements 
year issue currently  the company utilizes third party software in all of its computer applications 
the company s information systems personnel are currently working with the third party vendors to resolve the potential problems associated with the year and the processing of date sensitive information by its computers and other systems 
based upon a continual evaluation and working with software vendors  the company has determined that upgrading its existing accounting software to a current version will enable the computer systems to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter  with minimal cost to the company 
this upgrade is expected to be completed by mid the company is still evaluating the effect of the year on other computer systems and non information technology systems  including telephone systems  office and rig based electronic equipment and devices with embedded microprocessors 
additionally  the company is currently contacting all key vendors and suppliers to ensure that they have a year compliance plan in an effort to minimize the company s exposure to their potential year problems 
the company anticipates completion of its evaluation of non information technology equipment  key vendors and suppliers and any remedial action and or a contingency plan  if necessary  by mid with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue is not expected to pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
however  if such modifications or conversions are not made or are not completed on time or if the company s year issues are more complicated or costly than the company currently estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company believes that it will be able to implement successfully the changes necessary to address the year issues with reliance on its third party vendors and does not expect the cost of such changes to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on its amended credit facility 
interest on borrowings under the amended credit facility is at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either the prime interest rate or libor 
the company may  at its option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor for days to months  with longer periods requiring bank approval 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its amended credit facility 
based upon this balance  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
the company s objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company conducts business in several foreign countries 
predominately all of its foreign operations are denominated in us dollars 
the company structures its drilling contracts in us dollars to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
other than some limited trade payables the company does not currently have financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates
