liquidity and capital resources in january  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
in the offering  the company sold  shares and a shareholder of the company sold  shares 
shortly thereafter  the representatives of the several underwriters exercised their over allotment option resulting in the sale of  shares by other shareholders of the company 
the net proceeds to the company were approximately  the company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders 
the company used  of the proceeds from the initial public offering during the third quarter of   during the first quarter of   during the third quarter of and  during the fourth quarter of for the acquisitions of dp career associates  data systems technology  inc and the avery group  described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
between january  and march   the company spent  on its acquisitions of dp specialists  inc and dp specialists learning center  llc dps collectively  the professionals computer management consulting  inc  krystal solutions  inc 
and solution technologies  inc these acquisitions caused the company to exhaust the balance of the proceeds from the sale and incur approximately million in debt on its credit facilities 
the company made its first sale of stock under the metro information services  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp on september  the company sold  shares for an aggregate purchase price of  on september    shares for  on december    shares for  on march    shares for  on june    shares for  on september  and  shares for  on december  the espp is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   certain employees exercised stock options which vested on december  pursuant to the employee incentive stock option plan 
total proceeds from the issuance of stock for option exercises during the year ended december  were  the company funds its operations primarily from cash generated by operations 
net cash provided by operations was  for and consisted primarily of net income of  and  excluding the effects of acquisitions  increases in accounts receivable of  accounts payable of  and accrued compensation and benefits of  the increases in accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued compensation and page benefits are primarily due to the revenue growth experienced during the company s working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  the company has  of credit facilities provided in equal amounts by three banks  approximately  of which is available as of march  the facilities have a five year maturity  which may be extended each year for an additional year 
if the facilities are not extended  principal repayment is required at the end of four years 
until that time interest only is payable monthly 
two of the facilities allow the company to select among prime rate and london interbank offered rate libor based interest rates while the third has only libor based interest rates 
all of the facilities have interest rates which increase as the balance outstanding under the facilities increases 
the company has selected a day libor based rate and  if any borrowings were outstanding under the facilities at december   the rate on such borrowings would have borne interest rates ranging from to 
the facilities also contain fees  ranging from to annually  which are charged on the unused portion of the facilities 
the facilities are collateralized by accounts receivable of the company 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the facilities 
the credit facilities contain several covenants  including one requiring the maintenance of a certain tangible net worth ratio  which limit the amount of dividends that can be paid 
the covenants also impose limits on incurring additional debt and require a certain debt service coverage ratio to be maintained 
amounts advanced under the facilities can be used for acquisitions and general working capital purposes 
the company believes that the available funds under its credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet its needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next two years 
any significant acquisitions  however  may require additional debt and equity financing 
seasonality metro s operating results are adversely affected when client facilities close due to holidays or inclement weather 
the company generally experiences a certain amount of seasonality in the fourth quarter due to the number of holidays and closings of client facilities during that quarter 
further  the company generally experiences lower operating results in the first quarter due in part to the timing of unemployment and fica tax accruals and delays in clients contract renewals related to clients budget approval processes 
inflation due to the high demand for it services and a shortage of qualified it consultants  wage inflation in the it services industry surpassed normal wage inflation during if this trend continues  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition if the company is unable to pass increased payroll costs on to its clients 
the company attempts to obtain bill rate increases from clients to offset these increases whenever possible 
the company expects to obtain bill rate increases in to offset pay rate increases in  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
average pay rates for increased over average pay rates for average pay rates for increased over average pay rates for the company expects average pay rate increases in will fall between these percentages 
year issues many computer systems use dates to correctly process information 
until recently  computer systems used a two digit date to indicate a year 
for example  the year is indicated in these systems by the digits as the year approaches  these systems will need to process information involving the year and later years 
systems that use only a two digit year may confuse the year for the year  causing the systems to produce incorrect results 
this problem is commonly known as the year  yk or millenium bug year problem 
as an investor  you should be aware that the full extent of the year problem is unknown 
the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued an interpretation in which it indicated that  the page extent of the potential impact of the year problem is not yet known  and if not timely corrected  it could affect the global economy 
the sec s interpretation requires publicly traded companies such as us to disclose additional information about their year problems 
this disclosure is the result of our effort to inform the investing public of the risks we believe are likely to affect us 
all readers of this document are encouraged to read the sec interpretation 
estimates of the cost to fix year problems worldwide run to the hundreds of billions of dollars 
additional costs in the form of business interruptions  additional repair costs and litigation costs may be incurred if the fixes do not work 
it appears there is no way to predict with certainty what will happen after december  it is certain  however  that the year will arrive soon 
as a result  all companies should be undertaking a study to determine how they may be affected by the year problem and take steps to address the effects where appropriate 
failure to do so could cause injury not only to the company that is not ready for the year  but every other person dealing with that company 
as a result  it is difficult for any company  including metro  to evaluate effectively the impact that third party failures may have on its business 
in this disclosure  we have assumed we will not be year compliant under the interpretation until all third parties with whom we have a material relationship provide us with written assurance that they expect to be year compliant in time 
we have treated written responses to our requests for this information  information provided on third parties web sites and information filed with the sec by our us public company clients as written assurance under this disclosure 
metro s state of readiness metro s approach to the year problem involves assessing  correcting and testing our internal systems  obtaining assurance from third parties who exchange information electronically with us that the information they provide will be year compliant  obtaining assurance or information on the state of year readiness of our material clients and suppliers  and developing contingency plans  when practical  to address expected year failures 
a discussion of each of these areas follows 
internal risks we completed an initial assessment of our systems in additional information received by us led to a second assessment during the third quarter of these assessments covered embedded computer chips  computer software  computer hardware  telephones  communications equipment  facsimile machines  scanners  copiers and voice mail which we own and were able to identify as critical to our ability to provide services to our clients 
these assessments identified a limited amount of software that displayed dates in an ambiguous digit format  but processed dates correctly in digit format 
we corrected this ambiguity in the third quarter of the assessment also identified a variety of bios programs programs that allow personal computers to run that require additional upgrades to make them year compliant according to the manufacturer of the personal computers 
we finished upgrading these bios programs by december  we expect to finish upgrading certain non compliant computer operating systems by april  with patches provided by the computer manufacturers 
we will perform additional testing of our systems through june  after the assessments described above were made we acquired five companies the avery group  dp specialists  inc and dp specialists learning center llc dps collectively  the professionals computer management consulting  inc  krystal solutions  inc 
and solution technologies  inc 
we have completed an assessment of the avery group and the upgrade of noncompliant bios and operating systems 
we expect to perform testing of the avery group s systems through june  we are conducting an assessment of the systems used by the other acquired companies and expect to complete necessary upgrades by june  we expect to perform additional testing of their systems through september  we are seeking information from other companies with whom we have a material relationship 
we have or will send letters to these companies requesting confirmation that they will be able to continue their relationship with us at the same level and without interruption before and after the year as of march   we had not page received responses from of these companies 
we are continuing our efforts to obtain information from these companies 
when respondents have indicated they will not be compliant we have made plans to switch to alternate suppliers 
we are implementing other systems which we have received written assurances are year compliant 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we are not treating the costs of these new systems as year costs because we did not accelerate their implementation due to year problems 
external risks 
we are installing new software that we expect to begin using in see liquidity and capital resources 
this new system will increase the amount of information we exchange with our banks and k plan administrator 
in some cases  the year problem does not affect the information being received 
in other cases  we have received assurances from these institutions that they will be year compliant in a timely fashion 
in one case  we have made arrangements to receive the information in a usable digit year format 
we are relying on these assurances as part of our year planning 
if these assurances are wrong  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have reviewed filings made by our us public company clients who provided more than of revenue during the months ended december  this review covered filings through february   and was performed to determine the extent of the risk that our clients may not be year compliant 
these companies represented of our revenue for the months ending december  this review furnished the following information on our clients expected completion date for their year efforts will not not be year year by by by by disclosed compliant compliant now of metro revenue we have treated the information furnished in these reports as written assurance provided by these clients on the status of their year problem 
in some cases these clients have indicated they will be substantially complete or will have completed year efforts for their mission critical systems by the date indicated 
we have treated this disclosure as an indication that these companies will be able to continue their business relationships with us without disruption or failure 
we have or will request additional information from those clients who indicated they will not be compliant or provided no disclosure 
at present  we plan to monitor disclosures made by these publicly traded clients in forms q and k 
we are also requesting assurance from our other clients who provided more than of revenue during the months ended december  these clients represented of revenue during the months ended december  we have reviewed written assurances from these clients representing of revenue during the months ended december  this review furnished the following information on our clients expected completion date for their year efforts will not not be year year by by by by disclosed compliant compliant now of metro revenue we have not yet received assurance from the rest of these companies 
we expect to have more information on these companies when we file our quarterly report on form q in april or may if these clients do not become year compliant in a timely fashion  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
page business risks 
we are seeking written assurance from our clients 
see external risks above 
litigation risks 
we have limited our involvement in year projects and worked primarily on a time and materials basis 
we have also sought limitations on our liability for year related problems arising from our services when appropriate 
we are not able to estimate the cost of any litigation that may arise in the future 
costs to address the company s year problem our internal information technology staff will perform repairs to our internal systems 
we believe our internal systems will be year complaint by july  we may perform additional assessments  remediation and testing if information about year risks to our internal systems changes 
our internal information technology staff is also requesting information from our material clients and suppliers to address external risks 
we do not expect to incur material incremental costs to gather this information 
we will defer other projects these individuals could have worked on by about months 
we do not consider these deferred projects mission critical or expect their delay to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the cost of our year activities is expected to be approximately  approximately  of which had been incurred at december  risks of the company s year issues the year problem involves several risks for us 
one risk is that our computerized systems and embedded systems such as minicontrollers and chips in elevators  machinery and equipment internal risks and those of our clients  suppliers  vendors  financial institutions and others external risks will be disrupted or fail 
we also consider the possible loss of revenue when consultants on year assignments complete their assignments a year related risk 
we may also become involved in litigation over the year services we have rendered to our clients 
these risks have the capacity to cause a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition although we are uncertain what risks we will actually suffer 
these risks are discussed below 
internal risks 
we rely heavily on computer systems to run our business 
internal risks consist of potential disruptions and failures of our proprietary and purchased computer software  computer hardware  office equipment  office systems and turnover in our information technology staff 
software systems include recruiting  candidate tracking  payroll  human resources  benefits and financial accounting systems 
disruptions and failures of these systems could hurt our ability to bill our clients  collect money from clients  pay our employees in a timely manner and continue in business 
external risks 
external risks are risks that third parties will suffer year problems that adversely affect us 
these risks include the inability of certain third parties to exchange electronic data with us and the risk of disruptions and failures of persons with whom we do business 
these third parties include our clients  suppliers  vendors  financial institutions and others with whom we do business 
if we are not able to exchange information electronically with third parties  our ability to receive and pay money as needed may be slowed and information on k account and cash balances may be delayed 
if our clients  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions are not year compliant  their noncompliance may cause a material disruption to their businesses 
these disruptions could negatively impact us in many ways  including a client may be unable to pay us  a financial institution may be unable to process checks drawn on our bank accounts  accept deposits or process wire transfers  a client  supplier  vendor or financial institution may fail  vendor deliveries of computer equipment and other supplies may be delayed or cease  voice and data connections we use to share information may be interrupted and brokers who make a market in our stock may not be able to trade our stock 
this page list is not comprehensive 
other interruptions to the normal conduct of business by us  the nature and extent of which we cannot fully foresee  may also occur 
we are unable to determine the nature or length or effect such interruptions  if any  may have on us 
business risks 
as an it services company  we have benefited from the year problem by providing consultants with the skills necessary to help address these issues for our clients 
we face the risk of reduced business opportunities  revenue and profits as clients resolve their year problem if year assignments are not replaced with other assignments 
we believe that when consultants complete year assignments  many of these consultants will be re assigned to perform activities delayed by clients while addressing the year problem 
in other cases  we will need to find other assignments for these consultants 
we estimate that  at december   approximately of our consultants were involved in year assignments 
litigation risks 
approximately of our services involve writing custom software for clients and maintaining software for clients 
clients may sue us over work we have performed that causes or fails to fix a year problem 
this risk exists regardless of the steps we may take to provide error free year services and make our internal systems year ready 
any litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and may distract management s attention from running the business 
this distraction could have further adverse effects on the business 
the sec has directed us to describe our most reasonably likely worst case scenario posed by the year issues we face 
based on our current understanding of the year issues facing the company  we believe our most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that we will suffer little or no disruptions or failures in our internal systems  but minor disruptions and failures among our material clients  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions 
nonetheless  as we learn more from our material clients  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions  it is possible that this belief could change 
contingency plans we are developing year contingency plans where practical 
these plans address alternatives to electronic processing of candidate resumes  hires of new employees  terminations of existing employees  payroll  supplier payments  cash receipts from clients  invoices to clients and initiatives without e mail 
these plans also address furnishing required reports to clients  furnishing required governmental reports  gaining access to leased office space  shipping intracompany correspondence and communicating company reports 
these plans include stockpiling supplies and equipment  identifying alternative sources of goods and services and performing certain tasks manually 
for example  we may store paper copies of electronically stored data such as candidate resumes at locations likely to need them if we believe that the data will not be accessible due to a year failure 
in some situations  however  it is not practical to have an effective contingency plan 
for example  a failure by our primary banking institution may interrupt our cash receipts and our ability to pay our employees in a timely manner 
our contingency plan may call for paying employees in cash  but may not be practical due the amount of cash involved  the number of company locations and the number of employees who must be paid 
our payroll is currently several million dollars per pay period paid through locations in metropolitan markets to over  employees 
as an investor  you should be aware that the number of year failures suffered by us may exceed our ability to address them all at one time 
in addition  significant year failures by third parties  including clients  may jeopardize our financial strength 
in severe circumstances  our ability to continue as a going concern may be threatened or we may fail 
we believe  however  that we are taking reasonable and prudent steps to address the year problem based on the information currently available to us 
we will continue to monitor this issue and plan to modify our approach to the problem if we believe the circumstances warrant such a change 
new systems implementation the company has licensed new human resources  payroll and financial accounting software 
these systems provide enhanced capabilities and integration of information and are believed to be yk compliant 
a combination of metro employees and outside consultants will be used to implement these systems 
the company s current page estimate of the cost to replace these systems is million 
the company expects to capitalize and amortize these costs over these systems useful lives 
recent accounting pronouncements on march   the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this sop provides guidance on capitalization of certain costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application was encouraged in fiscal years for which annual financial statements had not been issued 
the company adopted the sop effective january  the sop causes amounts that otherwise would have been charged to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period incurred to be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the computer software  typically three to seven years 
through december    in costs have been capitalized by the company pursuant to this sop 
for the year ended december   the effect of this change in accounting was to increase net income by  and increase basic and diluted income per share by 
because the sop requires that computer software be ready for its intended use before amortization begins  no amortization expense has been recognized for these amounts through december  risk associated with future operations dependence on qualified personnel 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain consultants with the technical skills and experience required to meet its clients specific needs 
the company must continually identify and recruit technical personnel in each of its markets to fill new positions and to replace consultants who have left the company 
the it industry has high consultant turnover rates and the demand for consultants has  to date  substantially exceeded supply
