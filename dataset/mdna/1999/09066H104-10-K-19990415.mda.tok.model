item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations product sales were  in  an increase of  or over in  product sales were  an increase of  or over product sales in the united states were  in  an increase of  or over the increase in sales was driven by increases in sales of assays and oligos 
product sales in the united states were  in  an increase of  or as compared to the increase in us sales for was driven by increases in assay kits 
product sales to european customers were  in  a decrease of  or over the decline in sales was driven primarily by reduced sales of radioimmunoassay ria kits 
these kits are facing strong competition from non radioactive assays and as a result we are realizing a decline in revenue and market share 
product sales to european customers were  in  an increase of  or over was the first full year of operations subsequent to the acquisition of medgenix diagnostics in june  the increased sales in reflect the benefit derived from this acquisition in increased sales of our ria and elisa immunoassay kits 
product sales in japan were  in  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the increase in sales was driven primarily by increases in sales of our elisa kits to both new and existing japanese customers 
however  japanese sales in the december quarter were affected by the current economic climate in asia 
we expect this issue to impact sales to japan throughout product sales in japan were  in  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the increase in sales was due to the acquisition of new distributors in japan and an aggressive expansion of our product lines into the japanese markets 
a large portion of our sales are derived from foreign sales  representing  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
although the percentage of domestic sales to total net sales has remained relatively constant  domestic sales volume has increased by  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the prior year 
gross profit gross profit for the years ended december   and was   and  or  and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit of  or in as compared to is primarily the result of charges of approximately  related to the establishment of a valuation reserve for our current antibody inventory and the reduction of standard costs for on hand elisa test kits and products manufactured in europe 
our strategy is to maintain a broad base of products available for sale to our customers 
with regard to the antibody product inventory  we offer over  antibodies for sale and find it to be more cost efficient to produce large quantities of the antibody product during each production run  however  this inventory turns slowly 
attempts have been made to reduce the quantity of antibody inventory maintained in stock in order to increase the inventory turnover  however  this approach did not allow us to maintain proper strategic levels of inventory necessary to service our customer needs 
as a result  in order to reduce the financial risk of excess or slow moving inventory resulting from the large production runs  the proper financial management policy with regard to the antibody inventory was determined to be one of expensing the cost of production as incurred as a component of cost of sales 
also  contributing to the reduced gross profit is an increased percentage of sales of lower profit oligonucleotides as compared to the prior year and costs relating to the sale of custom antibodies  custom peptides  sera  and buffers media resulting from our acquisitions of quality controlled biochemicals qcb and biofluids in december the increased gross profit of  in fiscal compared to is primarily due to increased sales of  resulting in additional gross profit of  combined with cost controls both in the united states and european facilities 
operating expenses research and development research and development expense for the years ended december   and amounted to   and  respectively 
the increased research and development expense of  in as compared to is primarily due to increased staffing costs  expenditures related to the development of new product lines and additions to current product lines  a reduction in grant funds received in the current fiscal year and research and development expenditures related to qcb for the month of december the increased research and development costs of  in as compared to was due primarily to incremental expenses associated with our acquisition of biosource europe 
additionally  we also recognized incremental expenses in in the united states in connection with the expansion of our core product lines including new elisa assay test kits  and other biomedical research and clinical diagnostic products 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense for the years ended december   and amounted to   and  respectively 
the increased sales and marketing expense of  or in as compared to is primarily due to increased staffing costs  costs related to the repatriation of a united states employee that had been assigned to an overseas position  and increased advertising and other marketing programs 
the increased sales and marketing expense of  or in as compared to is primarily due to incremental expenses associated with the acquisition of biosource europe 
additionally  costs for the united states operations reflect increased staffing costs and increased marketing and promotional expenditures 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for the years ended december   and amounted to   and  respectively 
the increased general and administrative expense of  or in as compared to is primarily due to increased staffing costs  the settlement of a claim by our former landlord of our belgian facility  costs associated with the closure of overseas offices  costs related to the repatriation of a united states employee that had been assigned to an overseas position  and costs related to operating qcb and biofluids for the period from the acquisition dates to december  the increased general and administrative expense of  or in as compared to is primarily due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition of biosource europe 
additionally  costs increased in the united states predominantly due to increased staffing costs required to support biosource s domestic growth 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for the years ended december   and amounted to   and  respectively 
the increase of  in as compared to was due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of qcb and biofluids in december the  increase in compared to is the result of intangible assets acquired with the acquisition of biosource europe 
purchased in process technology purchased in process technology for the years ended december  was  as compared to zero in both and the purchased in process technology charge in relates to the portion of the qcb purchase price that was allocated to products in development which had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and did not have alternative future uses and in accordance with applicable accounting rules  purchased in process technology is required to be expensed 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income  net net interest income for the years ended december   and amounted to   and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income for the year ended december  of  or as compared to is primarily due to reduced interest rates earned on invested cash  the use of our cash to fund the two acquisitions completed in  the share repurchase program  and interest expense on the debt incurred to fund the acquisitions 
the increased net interest income of  or for the year ended december  as compared to is due to income derived from investing  for a full year  excess cash received through our second primary offering of common stock which was completed in june provision for benefit from income taxes the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  the provisions for income taxes for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the income tax benefit recorded in is primarily due to the book versus tax timing differences relating to the inventory valuation reserves and purchased in process technology charges recorded in for financial statement purposes but will be deductible on our tax returns in future periods 
the increase in the income tax provision in as compared to relates to both increased pre tax income in and a reduction of a valuation reserve in which provided a tax benefit in trends and uncertainties the company consummated two acquisitions in december these acquisitions are primarily intended to broaden our product portfolio  increase sales to current and new customers  and provide new strategic locations for the manufacture and sale of products 
implementation of these strategic transactions has resulted in charges and write downs having an adverse effect on our financial results for the year ended december  in addition  there are business risks associated with acquisitions  including the successful integration of the acquired companies in an efficient and timely manner  the coordination of research and development and sales efforts  the retention of key personnel  and the integration of acquired products 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful  or if successful  will produce the desired results 
year the following statements constitute a year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
biosource s review of accounting and business systems in order to ensure year compliance is proceeding on schedule 
phase i of this project is the assessment and identification phase 
phase ii is the completion of necessary modifications and upgrades identified during phase i 
we expect to complete both phase i and phase ii during the first half of as part of phase i  the company has engaged an outside consulting firm to assess issues surrounding our desktop computer and telephone systems 
additionally  we have assessed our accounting systems 
to date  we have identified that one of our accounting systems is not currently year compliant and  during phase ii  a normal conversion and upgrade path is in progress which will provide us with the year compliant current release of the accounting system 
we expect to complete this conversion during the first half of also as part of phase i  the company is assessing other business and operational systems and contacting suppliers and customers in an effort to identify additional year issues 
we expect to complete modifications identified as part of this effort during the first half of to date  we have spent an immaterial amount on the compliance program  and we do not expect the cost associated with required modifications and capital expenditures to become year compliant to exceed  the foregoing costs do not include our internal costs principally the payroll costs for those person s working on the project  which costs we do not track 
the reasonably likely worst case scenario of biosource s failure to correct a material year problem would likely be an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
these failures could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers which we have not fully assessed  we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on our results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
the year project is expected to reduce our level of uncertainty about the year problem 
we do not generally rely on sole source suppliers  and consequently we believe that we will have alternative sources of supply available as a contingency in the event any of our suppliers suffer material year problems 
we do not anticipate material problems with our power supply or telecommunications 
we believe that  with the implementation of the new business systems and completion as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
subsequent to the completion of our upgrade efforts and the determination of our customer and vendor compliance with year  we will ascertain the need for a formal year contingency plan 
stockholder rights plan on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each of share of common stock outstanding on march  the purchase rights are subject to the terms and conditions of  the right agreement dated february   and filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   on form a

recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
addresses the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
we are evaluating the statement s provisions to determine the effect on its financial statements 
in addition  the impact of sfas no 
will depend on the terms of future transactions 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued a statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
biosource will adopt sop effective on january  the adoption of sop will require us to modify our method of accounting for software 
based on information currently available  we do not expect the adoption of sop to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  of  decreased by  or from  at december  working capital  which is the excess of current assets over current liabilities  at december  was  as compared to  at december  representing a decrease of  or 
the reduction in cash and working capital resulted primarily from the use of cash to acquire qcb and biofluids  the purchase of the company s stock under the stock repurchase program  and the charges associated with the creation of the inventory valuation reserves in also affecting working capital during is an accounts receivable increase of  which is primarily due to  of accounts receivable acquired with qcb and biofluids and an increase of  in the company s european operation 
the increase in the european accounts receivable is due to a slowdown in collection efforts during due to both the company s simultaneous move to new facilities in belgium and the conversion to a new computer system 
biosource s policy is to maintain liquidity in its investments to provide working capital and have the ability to react to future potential long term investment opportunities in complementary businesses  products or technologies 
capital expenditures of  were primarily for the purchases of laboratory  manufacturing and computer equipment 
in april  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock at market price 
in december  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  additional shares of its outstanding common stock at market price and in august we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional  shares of the outstanding common stock at market price 
during the year ended december   we have repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for  an average price of 
as of december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of the company s common stock for  an average price of per share since the inception of the repurchase program in april in december   we executed a loan agreement with union bank of california  na and borrowed  which was to be used to finance the acquisitions of quality controlled biochemicals  inc and all of the assets and selected liabilities of biofluids  inc the principal amount outstanding as of december  was  principal repayments are to be made at approximately  per month for the seven year term of the loan 
interest is provided at a rate which is per annum in excess of either the bank s adjusted treasury rate  or the bank s libor rate  in each case  for a term we select 
the actual interest rate at december  was 
the loan matures on december  the terms of this loan require us to maintain a minimum cash balance of  as of december  and beginning january  to maintain minimum cash balances of  additionally  we must maintain a minimum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net assets  achieve minimum net profit levels  and comply with specified ratios of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to debt service costs 
we are also required to comply with certain non financial covenants 
at december   we are in compliance or have obtained waivers with regard to these covenants 
qcb had six loans outstanding aggregating  with metrowest bank which we assumed upon completion of the acquisition of qcb in december the loans mature from april  through with rates between and 
under the terms of these loans we must meet certain financial covenants which include  a minimum tangible net worth covenant  debt to tangible net worth  current ratio covenant  and other non financial covenants 
at december   we are in compliance with or have obtained waivers with regard to these covenants 
risk factors many of the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that inherently involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with such forward looking statements which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statements appear below 
in addition to the other information contained in this report  prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and cautionary statements 
we rely on raw materials for our manufacturing 
our manufacturing process relies on the continued availability of high quality raw materials  many of which we currently receive from specific vendors 
it is possible that a change in vendors  or in the quality of the raw materials supplied to us  could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing process and  ultimately  on the sale of our finished products 
we have from time to time experienced a disruption in the quality or availability of certain key raw materials  which has created minor delays in our ability to fill orders for certain test kits 
this could occur again in the future  resulting in significant delays  and could have a detrimental impact on the sale of our products 
we are engaged in a competitive industry 
we are engaged in a segment of the human health care products industry that is highly competitive 
many of our competitors  both in the united states and elsewhere  are major pharmaceutical  chemical  and biotechnology companies  and many of them have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs  and facilities than we do 
any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than any that we have or may develop  and may also be more successful than us in producing and marketing their products 
not only do we face intense competition in the marketplace against our competitors  but we also must compete with these same companies for the services of personnel 
we expect competition to continue and intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions for our products  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could adversely impact our business 
our industry has also seen substantial consolidation in recent years 
we believe that the success that others have had in our industry will attract new competitors 
some of our current and future competitors may join forces to better compete against us 
we may be not be able to compete effectively against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively 
international sales can be subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we also depend on third party distributors for a material portion of our international sales 
if we lose or suffer any significant reduction in sales to any material distributor  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  approximately of our sales are made in belgian francs 
in the past  gains and losses on the conversion of our accounts receivable arising from international operations have contributed to fluctuations in our results of operations  although the impact of foreign exchange conversions were not significant during in general  increases in the exchange rate of the united states dollar to foreign currencies cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in those countries  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in some cases 
we depend on key management 
our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the members of our management team and  in particular  on our chief executive officer  james h 
chamberlain 
as is the case with any company  we may not be able to retain the services of our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified members to management in the future 
the loss of services of mr 
chamberlain  or of any key employee  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system  and there has been substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of the common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant contracts  changes in management  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  legislative or regulatory changes  general trends in the industry  recommendations by securities industry analysts  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of our common stock  as well as the stock of many technology companies 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
we are subject to extensive government regulation 
we operate in a highly regulated industry 
our business is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
also  from time to time we must expend significant resources to comply with newly adopted regulations as well as changes in existing regulations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to certain disciplinary actions or administrative enforcement actions 
such actions could result in penalties  including fines 
protection of our trademarks and propriety rights is uncertain 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with employees  customers  partners and others to protect our proprietary rights 
we have pursued the registration of our trademarks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available 
we cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our proprietary rights  especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we could be required to incur significant expenses in preserving them 
year issues 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  manufacture product  or engage in similar normal business activities 
our own information systems correctly define the year we are currently analyzing the extent to which the year issue affects our major suppliers systems  insofar as they relate to our business 
we cannot currently predict the extent to which the year issue will affect our suppliers  or the extent to which we would be vulnerable to the suppliers failure to remedy any year issues on a timely basis
