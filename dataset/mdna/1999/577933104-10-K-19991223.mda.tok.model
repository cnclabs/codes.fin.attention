traditionally  federal government contracts have been cost plus and a majority of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts because the company is subject to the risk of potential cost overruns or inaccurate revenue estimates

the company s ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the service costs related to the company s fixed price and performance based contracts 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the client 
the profitability of the consulting group s contracts is largely dependent upon the utilization rates of its consultants and the success of its performance based contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of management  marketing and administration costs including salaries  benefits  travel  recruiting  continuing education and training  facilities costs  printing  reproduction  communications and equipment depreciation

the company has audited its internal software and hardware and implemented corrective actions where necessary to address year problems 
the company has also reviewed the software and hardware of  and implemented corrective actions where necessary  at its divisions and subsidiaries 
although the assessment and remediation efforts have been completed  the company continues to evaluate year contingency plans in the event a service not in the control of the company experiences processing problems or failures 
the cost of these efforts has not been material  and the company does not anticipate that future costs will be material or will have a material impact on its operations or financial results

however  the company cannot be certain that year related systems failures in the information systems of clients will not occur and  if such failures occur  that they will not interfere with the company s ability to properly manage a contracted project and result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company believes that it has addressed all material year problems  there are a number of risks associated with year  only some of which are within the control of the company

as no specific instance of material year non compliance has been discovered to date  the company has not yet adopted any specific contingency plans to deal with year problems
