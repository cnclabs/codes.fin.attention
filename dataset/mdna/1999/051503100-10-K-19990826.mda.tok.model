warranties the company provides up to a three year parts and labor warranty against defects in materials or workmanship on all of its products 
servicing and repairs are conducted at the company s manufacturing facilities in minneapolis and south korea 
the company s warranty expenses have not been significant 
patents the company holds four patents  three of which it no longer considers significant 
the fourth patent  acquired in december  covers high density power conversion technology high density patent which enabled the company to offer external switching power supplies less than one half the size of current power supply products but with comparable power outputs 
the high density patent was issued by the united states patent office in and the original applicant did not pursue patent protection in foreign countries 
since the high density patent was issued prior to being assigned to the company  the company is precluded from seeking patent protection in most foreign countries 
for that reason  some of its competitors may use this type of technology for products manufactured and sold outside the united states 
also there can be no assurance that the scope of the high density patent will prevent competitors  many of whom have greater financial and other resources  from introducing competitive products or from challenging the validity of the high density patent 
seasonality as indicated by item b supplemental financial information  net sales of the company have reflected a certain degree of seasonality 
the company s first quarter falls during the summer months and during the first quarter of fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded levels of sales which were generally lower than sales that were recorded for the succeeding periods 
the company attributes this seasonality to the buying patterns of its customers  the timing of industry trade shows where new products are introduced and to other factors 
the company believes that similar seasonality trends will be experienced in the future

the electronic equipment market is characterized by rapidly changing technology and shorter product life cycles 
the company s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop new products that keep pace with technological developments and respond to changes in customer requirements 
any failure by the company to respond adequately to technological changes and customer requirements or any significant delay in new product introductions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products to be developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
see business design engineering and product development 
fluctuation in financial results 
the company s financial results are subject to fluctuation due to various factors  includintg general business cycles in the company s markets  the mix of products sold  stage of each product in its life cycle and the rate and cost of development of new products 
in addition  component and material costs  the timing of orders from and shipments of products to customers and deferral or cancellation of orders from major customers could adversely affect financial results 
price competition in the markets in which the company competes is intense  and could result in a decline in gross margin  which in turn could adversely impact the company s profitability 
dependence on outside contractors 
the company currently depends on third parties located in foreign countries for a significant portion of the manufacture and assembly of certain of its products 
some of these countries are economically troubled areas 
the company s reliance on such outside contractors reduces its control over quality and delivery schedules 
while the company takes an active role in overseeing quality control with its third party manufacturers  the failure by one or more of these subcontractors to deliver quality products or to deliver products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  the company s third party manufacturing arrangements are short term in nature and could be terminated with little or no notice 
if this happened  the company would be compelled to seek alternative sources to manufacture certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that any such attempts by the company would result in suitable arrangements with new third party manufacturers 
see manufacturing and sources supply 
dependence on key personnel  management of growth 
the company s success depends in part upon the continued services of many of its highly skilled personnel involved in management  engineering and sales  and upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified employees 
the loss of service of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not have key person life insurance on any its employees 
in addition  the company s future success will depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage growth successfully and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively utilize the team approach to manage its employees 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
anti takeover considerations 
certain anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval under the company s right plan may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or merger of the company 
these provisions could delay  discourage  hinder or preclude an unsolicited acquisition of the company  could make it less likely that stockholders receive a premium for their shares as a result of any such attempt and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
see note stockholders equity under notes to consolidated financial statements 
year interruptions 
the company utilizes several microchip based date referenced systems for its business operations  including the timely procurement of material and supporting customer requirements 
because these business matters are also dependent on support from external sources  the company cannot provide any assurance that its ability to provide service to customers will not be interrupted by the inability of any supporting microchip based date referenced system to timely process data 
this situation could have an adverse material effect on the company s ability to retain customers and to generate revenue and profitability

for such forward looking statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of shareholders and the investing public should understand that such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause results or developments to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the overall level of sales by oems in the telecommunications  data communications  computer peripherals and the medical markets  buying patterns of the company s existing and prospective customers  the impact of new products introduced by competitors  delays in new product introductions  higher than expected expense related to sales and new marketing initiatives  availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and components and other risks affecting the company s target markets generally  including risks described under item above 
results of operations net sales net sales were  for fiscal up from  for fiscal which were up from  in fiscal the improvement in fiscal is primarily due to strong growth in sales within the telecommunications and data communications markets where the company s products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems for use in applications such as modems  network routers and wide as well as local area network systems 
the company believes that orders for its products will continue to increase in fiscal because of growth in the telecommunications data communications  computer and medical markets served by the company  and the acquisition in fiscal of the power supply business of lzr electronics  inc significant among the applications for the company s products are cable and analog modems  wireless telephones  scanners  electronic testing instruments and portable medical products 
cable modems  fastest growing among these applications  are designed to process data transmitted over cable lines that also transmit television signals 
dataquest  a nationally known marketing research organization  forecast cable modem shipments growing from  units in to million units by the company believes that  because of its established relationships with several major manufacturers of cable modems  it is well positioned to benefit from growth in demand for these products 
many of these applications are designed to function with the company s switching power supplies  one of the highest margin products of the company 
orders and sales for the company s products for portable medical product applications also grew during fiscal these products utilize the company s switching power supplies and battery chargers and are traditionally the company s highest margin application 
acquisition of lzr to strengthen its position in the medical product application market  the company acquired the assets of the power supply division of lzr electronics  a closely held corporation located in gaithersburg  maryland in december prior to being acquired by ault  lzr had annual revenues of approximately million in calendar and lzr s product line is based on a technology platform which allows the efficient development of customer specific power supplies for medical markets requiring lower volumes of production 
in addition to complementing the company s sales for many high volume applications  many of lzr s products are agency approved for medical product applications 
the company believes that its greater sales channels and larger customer base will enable it to leverage the lzr product line to greater revenue levels 
new product development service to customers continues as a strong strategic focus of the company 
to this end  the company s engineering activities are directed to developing products for various customer applications that are anticipated to generate revenue in fiscal and later years 
in addition to cable modems and portable medical products  these applications include uninterruptible power supplies  power supplies for asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl modems a competing technology to cable modem  hubs  routers and switchers for the networking market 
all of these factors are the basis for the company s belief that the growth realized in its fiscal sales will continue through fiscal order backlog the company s order backlog at may  totaled  compared to  at may  and  at june the order backlog at may  represented sales for approximately thirteen weeks and reflected the posture of many oems to limit their contractual commitments to the best lead times of their suppliers 
order backlog as an indicator of future shipment and raw material requirements has changed because of the company s shorter lead times available from customers 
these changes require the company to place greater reliability on its ability to forecast customer needs and requirements for on time shipment of products 
gross profit gross profit increased to  or of net sales for fiscal   or of net sales for and  for fiscal which was of net sales 
the improvements are due principally to the greater proportions in the sales mix of battery chargers  as well as linear and switching power supplies  which have higher margins as compared to transformer products 
revenue from shipments of transformers  traditionally a lower margin product  decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses operating expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal  as compared to  equaling of net sales for fiscal in fiscal  operating expenses were  or of net sales 
the increased expenditures were incurred principally due to sales commissions paid to sales representatives on the larger sales in fiscal  integration of lzr into the company  and continued support of strategic initiatives to achieve the following purposes strengthen the company s sales and marketing competitive position in the us and asia 
enhance asian manufacturing supervision 
provide and maintain direct communication links between ault us and ault korea 
install and maintain programs to upgrade the quality of management information services 
certify products for sale in broader foreign markets and to respond more expeditiously to customer requirements 
upgrade logistic support to provide forecasting techniques necessary to meet product delivery lead times and to support us customs requirements necessitated by increased foreign business activities 
these higher operating expenses will also affect profitability in the first quarter of fiscal it is anticipated that expenditures relating to these matters will contribute to the generation and support of future business in fiscal and beyond 
the company s objective is to reduce the proportion of operating expenses to future net sales without jeopardizing future business 
operating income operating income totaled  for fiscal and  for fiscal equaling  respectively  and of net sales 
operating income totaled  for fiscal or of net sales 
the improvements in operating income for fiscal are due principally to the greater sales and better gross margin on the mix of products  as previously discussed 
the decrease in operating income from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to implementation of strategic initiatives 
non operating income other income of  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal represented principally interest income  currency exchange rate gains on foreign contracts by the korean subsidiary and income derived from rented portions of the korean manufacturing facility 
the company incurred interest expenses of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal paid principally on bank credit facilities and long term borrowings 
income tax the company had pre tax income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal on which us and korean income tax of  or and  or were incurred 
pre tax income for fiscal equaled  with a net tax benefit of  after reinstatement of certain deferred tax assets of  the tax rates for fiscal and fiscal are below the normal rates because of the utilization of business credits and of net operating loss carry forwards by the foreign operations to offset portions of their accrued taxes

further use of cash from increased net sales is anticipated in fiscal b increases in inventories used  of cash 
the increases are due principally to requirements of customers that the company carries additional stockings of finished products to support their emergency needs 
this is a normal business practice in the power supply market 
no changes that are anticipated over the near term are expected to be of any significant impact on use of cash

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the economic downturn in south korea  which in fiscal resulted in a dramatic devaluation of the won  the country s currency  has improved 
however  compared to its value during the past several years  the won remains weak in relation to the value of the us dollar 
the effect of translating the korean financial statements  which were prepared in won  to us dollars  resulted in a net asset value increase of  during fiscal  which related principally to long term inter company receivables 
summary the company s cash and working capital positions are sound and  together with its credit facilities  are adequate for the support of the company s strategies into fiscal year information about products and services the company s business operations are comprised of principally one activity the design  manufacture and sale of equipment for converting electric power to a level used by oems principally in computer peripherals  data communications telecommunications and medical markets to charge batteries  and or power equipment 
the company supports these power requirements by making available to the oem products that have various technical features 
these products are managed as one product segment under the company s internal organizational structure and the company does not consider any financial distinctive measures  including net profitability and segmentation of assets to be meaningful to performance assessment

impact of foreign operations and currency changes south korea had a significant fall in the value of its currency during the third quarter of fiscal  but recovered portions of the early loss by the end of the fiscal year and showed relative stability through fiscal although products manufactured by the korean subsidiary contributed a large portion of total sales  the devalued won had no significant impact on the company s consolidated sales for the year because the predominant portions of the subsidiary s sales were made under inter company contracts with the us operations 
sales by the subsidiary in its local market are not material in amounts in contrast to its inter company sales 
the company s us operations have no significant exposure to currency risks because the predominant portions of its foreign contracts are made in us dollars 
ault addresses yk issue yk revised august  the yk issue is principally the result of computer programs that were written and component embedded logic that were designed using two digits instead of four digits to define the year segment of a date field 
no recognition was given for the change in date identification after calendar that would require a distinction between year and years after the company s computer equipment  software and hardware with embedded logic technologies that are time sensitive may recognize a two digit date field using as the year instead of this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions in business  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness the company is not engaged in the manufacturing of products that are yk sensitive  but it uses yk sensitive products of other manufacturers and relies on services of others such as equipment suppliers  software providers and suppliers with yk sensitive manufacturing environment 
the data shown below describes the company s activities and preparedness affecting its suppliers  freight services  desk top software  other manufacturing information software and hardware and electric power support us suppliers the company has realigned its network of us suppliers and is concentrating its efforts to maintain uninterrupted material support only on suppliers it believes are dealing effectively with the yk issue 
guided by ault s forecast system and monitored by the company  each supplier will carry a minimum of four months of material enough to cover any potential interruptions during the critical times 
suppliers are now working from yk material forecast data 
asian suppliers many of our asian suppliers have been less reliant on electronic systems  relying to a great extent on manual systems 
arrangements have been reached where these suppliers are committed to carry up to eight weeks of supplies through the critical period of yk 
freight services all freight carriers surveyed or visited were reported as already yk compliant 
desk top software office users will be upgraded to office and excel spreadsheets troubleshooted  by windows users will be upgraded to nt  by symix business information software reported as being compliant will be run in a test environment using a hp for compliance proof  by other manufacturing information communications software the following software reported by their manufacturers as compliant 
the company will conduct test on systems as dated automatic test equipment for product reliability edi for customer supplier communications price quotation system 
this system was determined not yk compliant 
the company is designing a new system that will be compliant and ready by the following systems were documentary certified compliant lucent technologies email system at t telephone system pro engineering documentation software hardware hp unix server was tested compliant 
about of non compliant workstations already replaced remaining workstations will be tested and those not compliant will be replaced by hp unix operating system was reported by the manufacturer to be of questionable yk compliance 
the company will upgrade to hp version and test for compliance by electric power the company does not anticipate any interruption to its us manufacturing due to any non compliance from the local power company 
its china facility is already provided with backup generators and backup generators will be added its korea facility by october  cost to address year issues to date  the company has not incurred any significant expenditures in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues and has only used its internal resources in this effort 
the company presently estimates the labor costs used on compliance efforts to be approximately  and replacement of hardware to be about  with respect to future costs  the company estimates it will spend approximately  for remediation  validation and replacement of hardware and software which the company presently knows are not compliant and another  for future staff time for such remediation 
in addition  the company estimates that it may spend no more than another  on remediation and validation of products and programs which have not yet been assessed 
the company believes that these estimates are reasonable and of minimal impact on operations 
capital expenditures among these costs will be handled in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles 
all other costs are expensed as period costs as they are incurred 
the company does not consider that these period costs will be of any material impact on its operations 
the company does not anticipate any potential negative financial impact of year compliance issues relating to its business and its ability to function normally 
any significant business interruption  however  could have a material  adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks of year issues the company considers any adverse events to be unlikely and although remote  it recognizes the following situations as worse case issues that could result from any year non compliance customer litigation 
although the company believes that its efforts will ensure that there is no disruptions in the business or operations of its customers  the possibility exists  though remote  that some customers may experience problems that may motivate such customers to commence litigation against the company for restitution and damages that they believe may be related to such problems 
disruption of material supply 
the company has surveyed its suppliers with regard to their yk readiness and has taken action towards reasonable assurance that it pool of suppliers will be yk ready 
suppliers will maintain reserves of material through critical yk periods as are indicated by the company s forecast system 
disruption of the company s computer information system 
the company has identified all of its hardware and software that will require compliance 
some have been tested and upgraded or replaced 
final testing and necessary upgrading are anticipated to complete by october the company considers any disruption of its computer information system to be unlikely 
disruption of the company s computer based manufacturing supporting system 
the company has inventoried all of its vendor provided computer based systems  such as its testing and documentation systems 
although some vendors have provided documentary certification of compliance  the company expects to compliance test these equipment and remedy any defects by september while no disruptions are anticipated  the company believes that if disruptions occur  they will not be significant and will be dealt with promptly 
disruption of communication  utilities and other externally provided supports 
the company has surveyed its providers of electric power  telecommunication  banking and other services and does not anticipate that it will encounter any non compliance matters that originate from these service providers 
contingency plan the company has established contingency plans for non disruption of material supply as well as for the continuation of the supply of electric power to operate its asian subsidiaries 
the company does not anticipate that any further contingency provision will be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk approximately of the company s total assets are invested in trading securities of various domestic companies 
although the market value of these investments is subject to fluctuation from time to time  management does not believe that any risk of loss of the principal amounts would be material to the company s profitability or asset value 
the company experiences foreign currency gains and losses  which are reflected in the financial statements  due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar against currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the net exchange gain or foreign loss arising from this was not material in  and the company anticipates that it will continue to have exchange gains or losses in the future
