results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by the items as shown in the company s consolidated statements of operations years ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income total other deductions income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income from continuing operations compared to the company s net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period last year 
the increase in sales is primarily attributable to higher sales in protective packaging  which was the beneficiary of several large projects during in addition  a smaller component of the increase is attributable to the impact of pacific foam  which was acquired on november  this increase partially offsets a decrease in sales in the specialty segment 
the company expects that its acquisition of pacific foam will augment its specialty segment during gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to in the year ended december   from in the improvement is primarily related to intensive efforts by management to improve material efficiencies during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in  from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to from 
the increase in dollars and the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales are primarily due to the acquisition of pacific foam on november  continued systems enhancements  and additions to the management team 
ufpt k  page interest expense declined approximately  to  in  from  in although the company s outstanding debt at december  is higher than on the same date in  the average debt outstanding during the year ended december  was lower than in in addition  the company borrowed using a libor based interest rate rather than the historically used prime based rate 
as a result  average interest rates were lower in than in the company s effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
net income increased to  from  in compared to the company s net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period last year 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to the impact on sales of fce industries which was acquired by the company in january  as well as increased sales of the company s molded fiber packaging product 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  from in the improvement was primarily attributable to improvements in margins on sales of molded fiber product as well as an increase in molded fiber sales as a percentage of overall sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in from in the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales was due to a one time write off of receivables associated with a customer that filed for bankruptcy protection  additional expenses at fce industries  and additions to the management team

net cash used in investing activities was  and was used primarily for capital expenditures of  and the acquisition of pacific foam 
capital purchases in consisted primarily of foam cutting equipment in our packaging and specialty plants and the installation and enhancement of molded fiber packaging equipment 
including amounts due under the revolving credit facility  the company had a total debt outstanding of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of pacific foam  which was partially offset by the required debt service on long term debt and capital leases 
the company has a  revolving bank line  of which  was outstanding at december  borrowings through the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest at prime or libor plus 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has no significant capital commitments in  but plans on adding additional machinery to increase capacity or to enhance operating efficiencies in its manufacturing plants 
additionally  the company may consider the acquisition of companies  technologies or products in which are complementary to its business 
the company believes that its existing resources  including its revolving loan facility  together with cash generated from operations and funds expected to be available to it through any necessary equipment financing and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements through at least the end of however  there can be no assurances that such financing will be available at favorable terms  if at all 
year readiness the year issue is the potential for system and processing failure of date related data and the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has established a year compliance committee the committee which is comprised of members of senior management  finance  mis operations and engineering 
the committee s mandate is to design and implement a compliance plan that minimizes the risk of material adverse impact to the company resulting from events triggered by the turn of the century 
a full time year project coordinator has been appointed and a comprehensive corporate wide year project plan has been developed 
the committee has defined three categories of internal elements that are subject to risk  computer hardware and software  manufacturing equipment and facility equipment 
computer ufpt k  page hardware and software includes networking  operating and application software currently being used by the company as well as those that are planned to be installed prior to the year and the hardware platforms upon which they operate 
manufacturing equipment includes machinery and equipment  owned or leased  that is used by the company in the process of manufacturing inventory for resale 
facility equipment includes all other devices that potentially have microprocessor chips that were not included in computer hardware and software and manufacturing equipment  including  but not limited to  fax machines  security systems  heating air conditioning  telephone and other communication systems  copiers  sprinklers and elevators 
the approach for minimizing risk of noncompliance within each of these elements includes six phases  inventory  risk assessment  correction  validation  implementation and monitoring 
in the inventory phase the company identifies the items within each of the three previously defined elements 
the company has completed a thorough inventory of computer hardware and software  manufacturing equipment and facility systems and equipment at all plant locations 
the risk assessment phase includes identifying which of the items in the inventory are noncompliant and estimating the effects of noncompliant system  program and equipment failure 
the company has completed a comprehensive risk assessment for all plant locations  which identifies noncompliant and potentially noncompliant computer hardware and software  manufacturing equipment and facility systems and equipment 
all noncompliant items have been categorized as either business critical or non business critical 
business critical systems and equipment are being addressed first and non business critical systems and equipment will be addressed as resources are available 
in the correction phase  the company repairs or replaces those items that are noncompliant 
the company is in the process of implementing new financial and manufacturing software new software throughout all of its plants that is year compliant and should result in substantial compliance within the computer hardware and software element 
at this time  the company expects the correction of business critical computer hardware and software to be completed by september  the correction of business critical manufacturing equipment and facility systems and equipment is expected to be completed by july in the validation phase  the company confirms that corrections have resulted in bringing specific systems  programs or equipment into year compliance 
the validation of specific components will occur as each component is corrected 
in the implementation phase  the company integrates validated systems  programs and equipment into the business environment 
the implementation of specific components will be conducted as each component is validated 
the company expects that validation and implementation of business critical manufacturing equipment and facility systems will be completed by august  and that validation and implementation of business critical computer hardware and software will be completed by october  in the monitoring phase  the company closely observes the performance of corrected  validated and implemented systems  programs and equipment 
the monitoring phase begins at imple ufpt k  page mentation and will continue beyond the new year and as long as is necessary to satisfy the company that corrections have effectively dealt with year concerns 
independent of its own internal elements  the company is dependent upon the customers who order its products and upon numerous third parties who supply various items including materials  supplies  services  utilities and other items the company uses in the ordinary course of business 
included within these third parties is a group of several key foam raw material suppliers that collectively supply a significant portion of the company s foam used in production 
the company is in the process of surveying the compliance status of its key customers and third party suppliers 
however  the company may not ever be able to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties  such as its suppliers  service providers and customers 
as a result  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any significant shipment delays from its major suppliers or any major sales delays from its major customers due to year issues  the company cannot provide any assurance that these third parties will not experience year problems or that any may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company included the cost of the new software in its financial plan for the software and hardware costs have been and will continue to be capitalized and depreciated in compliance with the company s capitalization policy 
although the decision to implement the new software potentially resolves the year problem for the majority of the company s computer applications  it was made for operating reasons and is considered normal capital expenditures 
as a result  the company does not expect to incur material costs above and beyond the cost of implementing the new software 
the company expects to be substantially compliant by year  but can give no assurance as to its readiness or the readiness of its key material and service providers 
as a result  the company expects to complete a contingency plan the plan by april   that will address the operating issues in the event that any of its material or service providers fail to perform as a result of the year problem 
in addition  the plan will address operating considerations in the event that any of the company s internal elements fail to perform as expected 
the company can give no assurance that the plan will be effective 
to the extent that the company does not identify or properly address any material noncompliant systems or equipment operated by the company or by third parties  such as the company s suppliers  service providers and customers  the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is a systemic failure beyond the control of the company  such as a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure  or general disruption in the united states or global activities that could result in a significant economic downturn 
the company believes that the primary business risks  in the event of such failure or other disruption  would include but not be limited to  loss of customers or orders  increased operating costs  inability to obtain inventory on a timely basis  disruptions in product shipments  or other business interruptions or a material nature  as well as claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation  or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
ufpt k  page other a significant portion of the company s packaging sales of molded fiber products are to manufacturers of computer peripherals and other consumer products 
as a result  the company believes that its sales are somewhat seasonal  with increased sales in the second half of the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations in the last three years
