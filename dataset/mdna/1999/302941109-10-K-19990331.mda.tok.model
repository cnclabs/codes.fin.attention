the company obtained million of additional debt financing through the sale of subordinated debentures with warrants to an investor  maturing in march years ended december   and revenues 
total revenues in increased over excluding acquisitions completed in  revenues would have increased 
litigation services revenues decreased from to as a result of softness in the markets during the second and third quarter of  however  there was a improvement in our fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of as our volume of cases improved

direct cost of revenues 
direct cost of revenues consists primarily of billable employee compensation and related payroll benefits  the cost of contractors assigned to revenue generating activities and other related expenses billable to clients 
direct cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was in  in and in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits paid to office and corporate staff  as well as rent  marketing  and corporate overhead expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include amortization of goodwill 
as a percent of revenues  these expenses were in  in and in excluding goodwill amortization  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in and in  both lower than the in other income and expenses 
interest expense consists of interest on a line of credit and convertible debentures in and  in and  the interest expense associated with the purchased businesses referred to above 
additional cash  raised from the initial public offering allowed the company to pay off the line of credit in mid  thus reducing interest expense and increasing interest income during the second half of and the majority of in may  the million of subordinated debentures converted into common stock  further contributing to the decrease in interest expense in as compared to income taxes 
in  principally as a result of some of the goodwill amortization not being deductible for income tax purposes  the effective tax rate increased to 
it is expected that the effective tax rates will be between and in the foreseeable future 
the company s effective tax rate during the two years ended december   approximated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rates during each of these years  and a summary of the components of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
future assessment of recoverability and impairment of goodwill in connection with its various acquisitions  the company recorded goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of to years  its estimated periods that the company will be benefited by such goodwill 
at december   the unamortized goodwill was million which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
for financial reporting purposes  goodwill and all other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated period benefited 
the company has determined the life for amortizing goodwill based upon several factors  the most significant of which are the relative size  historical financial viability and growth trends of the acquired companies and the relative lengths of time such companies have been in existence 
management of the company periodically reviews the company s carrying value and recoverability of unamortized goodwill 
if the facts and circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired  the carrying value of such goodwill will be adjusted which will result in an immediate charge against income during the period of the adjustment and or the length of the remaining amortization period may be shortened  which will result in an increase in the amount of goodwill amortization during the period of adjustment and each period thereafter until fully amortized 
once adjusted  there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment and recoverability in future periods 
of the various factors to be considered by management of the company in determining whether goodwill is impaired  the most significant will be i losses from operations  ii loss of customers  and iii industry developments  including the company s inability to maintain its market share  development of competitive products or services  and imposition of additional regulatory requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company in generated million of cash flow from operations  an improvement of million as compared to this increase is attributable to an increase in net income excluding non cash charges principally depreciation and amortization of  and the favorable net cash effects of changes in working capital balances 
the company expects that cash flows from operations will increase in  in part as a result of additional operating cash provided from businesses acquired in late the company borrowed million in under its million long term credit facility with a bank to provide the million of cash needed to acquire klick  kent allen  inc  kahn consulting  inc  and sea  inc 
this credit facility was renegotiated in march  and the new terms extend the maturity date of the loan to september this maturity date may be extended an additional year if the company is successful in extending the maturity dates of certain notes issued to sellers of the acquired and businesses 
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses in and  and as described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company is obligated under certain seller notes totaling million at december  of the million outstanding at december   million will become payable in the company in march issued million of subordinated debentures to provide additional cash resources as the seller notes begin to mature 
the subordinated debentures initially bear interest at per annum  and mature in lump sum in march the debentures prohibit the payment of dividends without the written consent of the holder 
the company is required to comply with certain financial covenants related to operating performance and liquidity  as calculated quarterly  for both the revised and extended long term credit facility and the subordinated debentures 
the company believes that it will be in compliance with all covenants throughout during the company expended million for additions to property and equipment 
this amount included expenditures for internal information systems that allow the company to better manage its expanding operations 
at december   the company had no material commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and the financing arrangements completed in march will allow it to meet its obligations under notes maturing in  and further provide for the necessary cash resources required in the near term to fund its expanding operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
absent corrective actions  programs with date sensitive logic may recognize as rather than this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has commenced a process to assure year compliance of all hardware  software  and ancillary equipment that are date dependent 
the process involves four phases phase i inventory and data collection 
this phase involves an identification of all items that are date dependent 
the company commenced this phase in the first quarter of and is now complete 
phase ii compliance requests 
this phase involves requests to systems vendors for verification that the systems identified in phase i are year compliant 
the company continues to replace critical systems that cannot be updated or certified compliant 
the company commenced this phase in the first quarter of and expects to complete this phase before the end of the second quarter of the company s principal compliance issue is focused on the existing business and accounting system developed over the past ten years 
a new business and accounting system has been implemented and is vendor certified to be year compliant 
in addition  the company has determined that substantially all of its personal computers and pc applications are compliant 
phase iii test  fix and verify 
this phase involves testing all items that are date dependent and upgrading the critical  non compliant system as well as completing the implementation of the new business and accounting system 
the company has begun this phase and expects completion by the middle of the third quarter of phase iv final testing  new item compliance 
this phase involves review of all systems for compliance and re testing as necessary 
during this phase  all new systems and equipment will be tested for year compliance 
the company expects to complete this phase by the end of the third quarter of the company presently believes that  with the implementation of the new business and accounting system  including hardware and software  the year issue will not pose any significant operational problem 
this substantial compliance has been achieved without the need to acquire significant new hardware  software  or systems other than in the ordinary course of business 
the company is not aware of any other material year non compliance that would require repair or replacement that would have a material effect on its financial position 
as part of the year process  formal communication with the company s suppliers  customers and other support services has been initiated during the first quarter of and efforts will continue until positive statements of readiness have been received from all third parties 
to date  the company is not aware of any year non compliance by its customers or suppliers that would have material impact on the company s business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that unanticipated year non compliance will not occur  and such year non compliance could require material costs to repair or could cause material disruptions if not repaired 
the company is in the process of developing a strategy to address these potential consequences that may result from unresolved year issues  which will include the development of one or more contingency plans by mid item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings and assuming a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates under the company s long term bank credit facility for one year  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately  and net income would decrease by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
