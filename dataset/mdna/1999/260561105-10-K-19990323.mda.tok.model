on may   the company completed the sale of telerate to bridge information systems  inc as a result  the company recorded a loss on its sale of million million after taxes 
results in included telerate restructuring charges of million after taxes  of which about was attributable to an impairment in telerate s carrying value with the remaining portion mainly attributed to severance costs 
in addition to these charges  telerate net losses from operations lowered consolidated results by million in and million in in  telerate contributed net income of million to consolidated earnings 
the disposition of telerate in as well as other special charges gains have had a significant impact on the comparability of the company s financial statements 
excluding these items  net income was million  or per diluted share  in line with net income of million  or per diluted share  a year earlier 
a reduction in television losses  improvements at dow jones interactive publishing and community newspapers and a positive swing to net interest income were offset by a decline in profits of us and international print publications 
for the purpose of assisting the reader with comparability  the company has presented the table on the following page which reconciles reported results to income excluding these special items for  and the term special items as used within the remainder of management s discussion and analysis refers to those items within the table

the restructuring charge in included staff reduction and occupancy related charges of million million and million  respectively 
as part of an effort to grow earnings per share and improve the company s margins  dow jones offered two voluntary retirement plans and closed certain operations resulting in severance and other costs 
in total  approximately employees throughout the company received severance 
also  as a result of reduced occupancy requirements post telerate  the company agreed to give back about of the leased space at its new york headquarters 
annual savings as a result of these actions are expected to be approximately million pretax 
page the million technology charge primarily related to the write off of certain modules of the company s us news editing technology system  the global news management system gnms 
the company started to build the gnms system in at a time when off the shelf external vendor solutions were not available 
the system was intended to provide state of the art electronic news writing and editing to support the company s print publishing operations 
while gnms added some increased functionality to the news staff s desktops  the system that was built was too complicated to effectively prepare the pages for printing 
the company decided it was more cost beneficial to invest in a new pagination system using current off the shelf technology rather than to invest additional resources in fixing the gnms system 
in december  after repeated systems instability  the decision was made to resume using prior in place news editing systems as an interim measure until a new pagination system can be selected and installed 
the majority of the news editing and composing staffs migrated off the gnms system in december to the prior news editing systems 
the remaining staff will be transferred by june  the company expects the new pagination system to be implemented over the next two years 
the write off will not lead to a reduction in annual depreciation expense 
the depreciation charge for the gnms modules still in use will be approximately the same as the full gnms depreciation charge in  as their useful lives have been shortened

page restructuring costs in  exclusive of telerate  totaled million consisting of a million charge to operations relating to restructuring idd enterprises million and us television operations million  and a million charge to equity in losses of associated companies for international television ventures 
the idd charge mainly reflected the write down of goodwill  while the million charge related to operating lease redundancies resulting from the merger of the company s international television operations with cnbc 
in december  the company and national broadcasting company nbc agreed to a worldwide business television alliance 
as part of the agreement  the company and cnbc s overseas television operations merged  resulting in equally owned ventures in europe and asia 
in the us  dow jones entered into a multiyear license agreement to supply business news programming to cnbc

year the year problem is essentially the inability of computer programs to operate properly after january   as a result of the software programs using two digits rather than four digits to identify a year 
the software may recognize to be the year rather than year  which could cause interruptions of normal business operations 
in  dow jones established a project team responsible for identifying and resolving year issues 
the team includes staff of the company as well as outside consultants 
efforts through the end of include  but are not limited to  identification and review of internal operating systems and applications  and customer products and services  prioritizing the remediation or replacement of such  tracking the progress of systems being remediated and replaced  as well as formal discussions with information providers and other key suppliers to the business  reviewing test results for year compliance and performing contingency planning specific to year issues 
the company has completed its assessment of its year problem 
the company expects its efforts to modify existing software and the replacement of certain systems will be completed so as not to interrupt ongoing operations 
costs over the period to modify the company s systems are expected to total between million and million 
of this total  approximately million has been incurred and expensed from the beginning of through the end of page as of december   on a corporate wide basis  approximately of all computer applications have been fully remediated or replaced 
the remaining are in various stages of remediation and testing with full certification expected by july the company has identified existing computer applications and categorized them into three categories applications to be modified  applications to be replaced by year compliant systems  and applications initially reported as year compliant that are required to be tested to confirm their readiness 
through  about of the applications requiring modification have been certified  over of applications requiring replacement have been certified  and of the initially reported year compliant applications over have been confirmed 
as applications are remediated or replaced year compliance is tested and documented at the application level 
all systems will be subject to integration testing 
integration testing exercises compliant hardware  system software and application code in a simulated year production environment 
this provides additional assurance that components that may have been tested separately  interface properly with all compliant component levels in place 
the company has prepared an inventory of computer hardware and platforms  as well as production and communication equipment  in order to make an evaluation of such items for year compliance 
in general  manufacturers of equipment and software providers are contacted to determine the compliance status of these items 
the company is coordinating the evaluation of the year readiness of significant suppliers and business partners 
the individual business units have identified providers of goods and services that could inconvenience or disrupt the ability of dow jones to provide its products to customers or could impact the profitability or reputation of the company 
these business partners have been contacted through correspondence in regard to their year readiness 
their responses as well as non responses are being evaluated and incorporated into the contingency planning 
certain significant business partners are being contacted directly including newsprint and ink suppliers  as well as information providers in order to better understand their year readiness 
during  the company will be reviewing business continuity plans with the various business units and developing contingency plans for mission critical processes that could likely be affected by the year problem 
this year contingency planning will be done in conjunction with the evaluation of supply chain responses 
the primary focus will be to plan for unprepared providers of goods and services  the potential for numerous simultaneous outages  facilities problems  and the potential for unforeseen internal and external failures of computer applications and hardware 
in addition the company is ensuring the availability of employees and others at year end 
the company s products and services as well as the tools that dow jones uses to conduct its year evaluation are dependent on technological components  equipment and software that were developed by third parties and that may not be year compliant 
failure of such third party components  equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year could interrupt ongoing operations or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
page while the company expects its year efforts will be successful  if the modifications and replaced systems are not made compliant in a timely manner  it could result in a material effect on the company 
outlook three year plan in september  the company completed a planning process covering the period 
as part of that planning process  the company developed corporate objectives  the most significant of which include to grow earnings per share at a compound rate of at least over the long term 
achieve a long term average corporate ebitda margin of  with segment ebitda margins of for print publishing  for electronic publishing  and for community newspapers 
migrate toward a profit mix between print publishing versus community newspapers and electronic publishing  combined 
given this objective  it is expected that electronic publishing and community newspapers will achieve higher growth rates than print publishing during the plan period and they will contribute a significant amount to earnings growth 
over the period  the average ebitda margin for both print publishing and community newspapers was 
over the period  the average ebitda margin for electronic publishing  excluding one time fees  was 
outlook while the company expects that will be a continued transition year  it is still committed to the earnings growth target as part of the focus forward plan 
in  the company anticipates growing earnings per share  excluding nonrecurring items  largely on the strength of print publishing and community newspapers operating income gains  a further reduction in television losses and a result of the company s share repurchase program 
assuming no further share repurchases and no new employee related issuances of stock  average shares outstanding in would be down as a result of the share buyback program 
for the us and international publications  we expect a challenging first half  with greater rates of growth in the second 
there is a more volatile environment for the wall street journal  which will require continued focus on margins 
although the journal is experiencing softness in financial advertising  domestically and in some overseas markets  the company expects that advertising revenues will grow overall from s base levels  largely through modest rate increases 
changes in advertising volume are unpredictable and are in a large part dependent on the us economy  and specifically on the activity in financial markets 
the journal will be faced with tougher advertising linage comparisons in the first half of  as wall street journal linage was up in the first half of  compared with a decline of in the second half of lower newsprint prices may partially mitigate the expected decline in first half advertising linage 
average newsprint costs were about per ton per ton in the first half of  newsprint consumption is expected to increase by to 
page while electronic publishing revenues are expected to grow in particularly in the second half  margins and potentially operating income are expected to be lower reflecting the company s accelerated investment initiatives  principally directed at expanding its services internationally 
additionally  dow jones interactive will have a reduction in revenues from a third party licensing contract and from the continued migration of its customer base to its web product 
the company will be adding to this segment s staffing levels to further expand international content and international sales 
also  the company expects any benefit from its newswires agreements in with bloomberg and reuters to be seen toward the last half of  as it will take time to expand selling efforts and launch commercial products 
community newspapers operating earnings and margins are expected to grow in revenues will likely advance as a result of rate increases  while expense growth will be marginal 
pretax television losses in are expected to be reduced to less than half of the loss  driven by operating income improvement in the us and a decline in losses in europe 
the company anticipates results from the asian region will be even with results  exclusive of one time charges 
union contracts including wage scales for about of the company s full time employees will be renegotiated in historically  the company and its major union have agreed to new contracts without work interruptions 
in  statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use was issued  which is effective beginning january  the accounting guidance standardizes the accounting treatment for internal use software
