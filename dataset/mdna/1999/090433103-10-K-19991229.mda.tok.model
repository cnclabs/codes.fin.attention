the company was formed by sun in response to the growing need to provide timely and competitive financing to residents in manufactured home communities 
the company has expanded its manufactured home lending activities through the use of dealer networks to communities not owned and operated by sun to the extent that now of the company s manufactured home lending is done outside the sun owned and operated communities 
the company provides financing for new and previously owned manufactured homes to borrowers whose credit needs may or may not be met by traditional financial institutions due to credit expectations or other factors

results of operations compared to the company had income before federal income tax of million on gross revenues of million and expenses of million in compared to a loss before federal income tax benefit of  for the year ended september  on gross revenues of million and expenses of million 
the large increase in gross revenues is primarily related to the significant increase in interest income as a result of a much larger average outstanding portfolio balance and the gain on sale of loans 
the large increase in gross expenses relates to increased interest expense and a large increase in personnel costs 
interest income on loans increased to million in  or approximately over interest income of million in the large increase is primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding loan receivable balance of million in versus million in  an increase of the increase in interest income as a result of the higher average outstanding receivable balance was slightly offset by a decrease in the average yield on the loan receivable portfolio of in versus in interest expense for the year ended september  was million as compared to million  an increase of for the comparable period ended september  the increase in interest expense is driven by the increase in the average outstanding balance of debt used to finance the loan receivables and fund operations

million for the comparable period in provision for credit losses is recorded in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance at a level considered adequate to cover losses from liquidating manufactured home loans and loans sold with recourse 
provision for credit losses increased approximately to  in compared to  in the large increase is primarily related to a increase in outstanding principal balance of manufactured home loans which was million at september  as compared to million at september  the provision increase is also affected by the increase in nonperforming manufactured home loans which were of the manufactured home loan outstanding principal balance at september  versus

the largest part of the increase is directly related to personnel costs 
the company increased its number of full time employees to at september  resulting in personnel costs of million for the year or an increase of 
this is compared to full time employees with personnel costs of million for the year ended september  these increases reflect the costs of the company s expanding its manufactured home lending operations to communities outside those owned and operated by sun and the expansion of its commercial mortgage lending business through the acquisition of hartger willard in the fourth quarter of the increase in personnel resulted in an increase in occupancy and office expenses to  for or increase over the comparable period in of  compared to the company had a loss before federal income tax benefit of  for the year ended september  on gross revenues of million and expenses of million

provision for loan losses is recorded in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance at a level considered adequate to cover losses from liquidating manufactured home loans and loans sold with recourse 
general and administrative and other operating expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared to  for the period ended september  the large increase was the result of underwriting and originating significantly higher manufactured home loan volumes in fiscal  operations for the full year rather than the shorter period from inception to september   and through the acquisition of bloomfield and bloomfield servicing with the related underwriting  originating and servicing of commercial mortgage loans

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of the company s ability to have adequate cash or access to cash at all times in order to meet financial obligations when due as well as to fund corporate expansion or other activities 
the company expects to meet its liquidity requirements through a combination of working capital provided by operating activities  draws on its revolving lines of credit  advances under its master repurchase agreement  whole loan sales and possible future periodic securitizations of its loan portfolio 
the company may also issue additional shares of capital stock when it believes existing shareholders are likely to benefit from such offerings 
during the year ended september  the company issued  shares of its common stock in private equity raises 
the stock issuance resulted in proceeds of approximately million in connection with its initial public offering the company entered into the subordinated debt facility with sun  which is subordinated to all senior debt of the company 
the subordinated debt facility consists of a million term loan with an annual interest rate of 
as of september   the company also had an million demand line of credit and a million demand line of credit with sun  both of which provide for an annual interest rate equal to the one month libor rate plus basis points 
at september  and the company owed sun million and million respectively under the subordinated debt facility and the revolving line of credit facilities 
in accordance with the subordinated loan agreement the company issued detachable warrants to sun covering  shares of common stock at a price of per warrant share 
the detachable warrants have a term of seven years and may be exercised at any time after the fourth anniversary of the issuance 
in march the company s commercial mortgage originating subsidiary entered into a one year master repurchase agreement with a lender to finance fixed rate commercial loans secured by real estate 
in september of that agreement was amended to include financing of manufactured home  floor plan and bridge loans 
at september  the maximum financing limits on the facility were million for commercial mortgage and bridge loans and million for manufactured home and floor plan loans 
the annual interest rate on the facility is a variable rate of interest equal to libor plus a spread  dependent on the advance rate and the asset class 
as of september  and approximately million and million of borrowings respectively were outstanding under the facility 
during the years ended september  and  the company completed the sale of approximately million and million in outstanding principal balance amount of loans from its manufactured home loan portfolio 
these sales resulted in approximate proceeds to the company of million and million respectively 
in the company also sold through securitization and whole loan sales approximately million of outstanding principal balance of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
the securitization and sales resulted in proceeds to the company of million 
there were no sales of commercial mortgage loans in market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk and are not included in the following table 
the following table shows the company s expected maturity dates of its assets and liabilities 
for each maturity category in the table the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflects an imbalance between repricing opportunities for the two sides of the balance sheet 
the consequences of a negative cumulative gap at the end of one year suggests that  if interest rates were to rise  liability costs would increase more quickly than asset yields  placing negative pressure on earnings 
maturity to to to over months months years years total in thousands assets cash and equivalents restricted cash   loans receivable      servicing rights   other assets      total assets      liabilities advances by mortgagors   accounts payable and accrued expenses   advances under repurchase agreement    subordinated debt   notes payable   other liabilities total liabilities     stockholders equity common stock   paid in capital accumulated other comprehensive income retained earnings total liabilities and equity      reprice difference     cumulative gap    percent of total assets management believes the negative effect of a rise in interest rates is reduced by the anticipated short duration of the company s loan receivables 
management intends that the loan receivables will be securitized or sold as part of a whole loan sale prior to the end of fiscal proceeds from the securitization or whole loan sales would be used to pay down the corresponding debt 
if the company were unable to securitize or sell the loans it would be necessary to renegotiate the master repurchase agreement described in note g to the consolidated financial statements  to extend the maturity date of the advances under repurchase 
the instruments held by the company are held for purposes other than trading 
the company also manages interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of us treasury securities  treasury rate locks and forward interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the fixed rate loans in the commercial loan portfolio 
the company uses these instruments in an attempt to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
in a forward sale the company has agreed to sell a treasury security at a future date with a predetermined price 
if interest rates on treasury securities drop  the price to the company to purchase the security in order to meet its settlement obligation will have risen  and thus the company will have suffered an unrealized loss on the hedge transaction 
conversely  if interest rates rise  the price to the company to purchase treasury securities will have fallen and there will be an unrealized gain 
the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge transaction should be offset by the decrease or increase in value of the underlying hedged loans since they are fixed rate loans that have an annual interest rate equal to a spread over us treasuries 
to effect a treasury rate lock the company has entered into an agreement with a counter party whereby a locked in treasury rate is established  usually the yield to maturity rate on a us treasury security 
if the current yield to maturity is greater than the locked in yield to maturity  a situation that would indicate rising interest rates  the rate lock will have increased in value and the company will have an unrealized gain 
the unrealized gain will help off set the decrease in value of the fixed rate loans caused by rising interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment the current yield to maturity on the treasury security would be less than the locked in rate creating an unrealized loss on the hedge position 
the declining interest rate environment should increase the value of the loans thereby off setting the loss on the hedge 
a forward interest rate swap is an obligation to enter into a swap or cash settlement on a future date for the difference between the market rate on that date and an agreed upon swap rate 
this transaction is similar to a treasury rate lock in that it allows the company to lock in a rate starting in the future 
the difference is that you will be locking in a future swap rate  not a forward treasury yield 
a forward interest rate swap allows the positive or negative effect of a change in the value of the underlying loans to be offset by the positive or negative payment on the settlement of the hedging transaction 
if interest rates rise the value of the loan portfolio will have decreased but the decrease will be offset by an increase in the value of the hedge equal to approximately the present value of decrease in value of the hedged loan portfolio 
if interest rates are declining the reverse would hold true  the value of the loan portfolio will increase and be offset by a decrease in the value of the swap approximately equal to the present value of the hedged loan portfolio increase

there are many important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
such factors include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  interest rate risk  demand for the company s services  the impact of certain covenants in loan agreements of the company  the degree to which the company is leveraged  the continued availability of the company s credit facilities  the risk of margin calls on the company s credit facilities and hedge positions  the performance of the company s subsidiaries  the company s year issues  and other risks identified in the company s securities and exchange commission filings 
in addition  past financial and operational performance of the company is not necessarily indicative of future financial and operational performance 
year readiness some computers  software  and other equipment include a programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than in the company initiated a corporate wide program designed to ensure that all critical computer programs function properly in the year the company is also analyzing and working with vendors and other external businesses to identify and avoid any year problems related to the software or services they provide 
phase i of the company s year project is complete 
it involved an assessment of the internal and external critical systems and hardware that could be affected by the year problem and the current compliant status of the system or hardware 
in phase ii of the project the company s management information systems staff developed solutions or implemented vendor provided solutions to remedy all year non compliant issues including non information technology systems 
all internal critical systems that required a year update provided by a vendor have been corrected 
to date there have been no systems that required complete replacement 
all non compliant hardware has been replaced 
any new systems or hardware to be acquired are verified to be year compliant 
phase ii also includes testing of updated systems and hardware for compliance 
this portion of the project is ongoing 
some testing needs to be completed on the company s servicing and origination systems 
at this time the company has received very specific statements of compliance on both systems 
the company continues to obtain statements of compliance from its external vendors and business relationships to verify that they are year compliant 
this part of phase ii was also expected to be completed by the second quarter of while the company has received statements of compliance from the majority of its outside vendors  it has not received all statements requested 
the company will continue to obtain the necessary statements of compliance from vendors and outside business relationships that it has defined as critical 
in the event the company does not complete any additional phases of year readiness  under worst case scenario the company would be required to process certain transactions manually  which may effect customer service 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could materially affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for equipment shutdown or failure to properly date customer records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
year compliance costs to date have totaled approximately  the majority of the cost is estimated mis personnel expense required for identifying  testing and  where necessary  updating critical systems 
the cost also includes the replacement of some non compliant hardware 
the company currently estimates the total costs of the year project will not be material to its financial position or results of operations 
the impact of year issues depends not only on the corrective actions the company takes  but also on the way these issues are handled by businesses  governmental agencies and other third parties that provide data  services and utilities to the company 
while the company is in the process of testing and correcting identified year problems  these procedures are limited to matters over which it is reasonably able to exercise control 
the company s ability to achieve year readiness and the level of incremental costs associated with it could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to modify proprietary software and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
recent accounting pronouncements in april the financial accounting standards board issued statement of position number sop reporting on the cost of start up activities 
this statement  which is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december  establishes guidance for the accounting of start up activities 
it states that the cost of start up activities  including organizational costs  should be expensed as incurred 
the company has deferred organizational costs related to the formation of its manufactured home lending subsidiary and the filing of its application to become a unitary thrift holding company and for the formation of a federally chartered savings bank 
as of september  those costs totaled approximately  any remaining unamortized balance at will be expensed 
in june statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas was issued 
sfas requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at estimated fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are to be recorded each period either in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  on the type of hedge transaction 
sfas is effective for the year the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas  at present the company does not believe it will have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations
