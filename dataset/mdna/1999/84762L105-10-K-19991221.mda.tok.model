item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in the financial statements section of this report 
introduction our operating performance depends upon a number of factors 
the most important of these factors are general retailing trends  especially in the mass merchandiser segment of the retail market our overall product mix among various specialty and general household batteries and battery powered lighting devices  which sell at different price points and profit margins our overall competitive position  which is affected by both our and our competitors introduction of new products and promotions and our relative pricing and battery performance changes in operating expenses we manage our business according to the following geographic areas north america  which includes the united states and canada latin america  which includes mexico  central america  south america and the carribean and europe rest of world europe row  which includes the united kingdom  europe  and all other countries in which we do business 
set forth below are specific developments that have affected and may continue to affect our performance 
investment in future growth opportunities 
since our recapitalization  we have undertaken significant measures to pursue growth opportunities and increase market share for our products worldwide 
these measures include acquiring the consumer battery operations of rov limited in latin america and the rayovac brand rights for battery products worldwide  with the exception of brazil  developing new markets for our hearing aid battery products through the acquisitions of brisco and the battery distribution business of best labs in  broadening our offering of specialty products through the acquisition of direct power plus in and expanding distribution by gaining new customers and increasing products sold to existing customers 
restructuring operations and other cost rationalization initiatives 
in september  we announced a series of operational initiatives to take advantage of global marketing opportunities afforded by our latin america acquisition 
these initiatives included the restructuring of the organization to streamline and better serve global markets and improve our overall operating efficiencies  the restructuring of manufacturing operations to position us for future growth and the termination of certain non performing foreign distributors 
we estimate that these initiatives will generate annual cost savings of approximately million beginning in fiscal we also completed measures in fiscal  that were initiated in fiscal  which were designed to maximize production and capacity efficiencies  reduce fixed costs and improve customer service 
we consolidated our domestic battery packaging operations and outsourced the domestic manufacture of heavy duty batteries 
we also consolidated our domestic button cell manufacturing and closed certain existing manufacturing  packaging and distribution facilities 
expansion of production capacity 
in fiscal we installed a new high speed manufacturing line to increase our capacity for alkaline aa size batteries by up to at a cost of approximately million 
we also completed a  square foot expansion of our portage  wisconsin facility and consolidated our appleton  wisconsin manufacturing operations into it 
we continue to compare our global production requirements against our global manufacturing capacity to improve the efficiency of our operations 
competitive position 
in june  ralston purina company announced that it was spinning off its battery company segment 
according to the form b filed in october  the new company energizer holdings  inc is expected to start trading on the new york stock exchange in april we do not believe this spin off a will create any more favorable market conditions for energizer than before the spin off and b will have a significant adverse impact on our financial performance 
seasonal product sales our sales are seasonal 
our highest sales occur in the fiscal quarter ending on or about december during the holiday season 
in the quarter ending september   our sales included approximately million of sales from the consumer battery business we acquired from rov limited 
our lowest sales occur in the fiscal quarter ending on or about march during the past three completed fiscal years  our sales in the quarter ended on or about december have represented an average of of annual net sales

late in fiscal we completed the acquisition of the consumer battery operations in latin america of rov limited for a purchase price of million  net of cash acquired 
per the terms of the purchase agreement  the purchase price is subject to adjustment and as of september   this adjustment had not been finalized 
we do not anticipate that this adjustment will be significant 
we financed the entire purchase price of the acquisition with additional borrowings under amended senior credit facilities 
the amended facilities which we obtained in august replaced our existing credit facilities with a million five year revolving credit facility and a million five year amortizing term loan 
the term facility provides for quarterly amortization totaling  in   in   and  and  in the fees associated with these amended facilities have been capitalized along with the fees for the existing facility and are being amortized over the term of the amended facilities 
indebtedness under these amended facilities is secured and is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
in addition  to facilitate our future growth  including the financing of our acquisition in latin america  we obtained the consent of the holders of our series b senior subordinated notes due to certain amendments to the indenture governing these notes 
the amendments to the indenture provide  among other things  that we may make senior secured borrowings under our credit facilities in an increased set amount without meeting certain financial tests  incur additional senior secured debt under our credit facilities above that set amount  provided that we meet certain financial tests  make investments in foreign subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes and incur additional indebtedness  on a secured basis  through our foreign subsidiaries

during fiscal  our board of directors granted  options to purchase shares of our common stock to various members of management under the stock option plan and the incentive plan 
all grants were at an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant with prices ranging from to per share 
we believe our cash flow from operating activities and periodic borrowings under our amended credit facilities will be adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements of our existing business prior to the expiration of those credit facilities  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
our current facilities include a revolving credit facility of million and a million term loan 
as of september   all of the term loan was outstanding and million was outstanding under the revolving facility  with approximately million of the remaining availability utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition or any material capital expenditure as a result of our efforts to comply with environmental laws 
as of september   we had reserved million for known on site and off site environmental liabilities 
some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our business  however  we cannot assure you that material environmental costs will not arise in the future 
see legal proceedings 
we engage in hedging transactions in the ordinary course of our business 
see note q to our consolidated financial statements 
year we have established a year project designed to remediate the impact of the year issue on our hardware and software systems  as well as other business processes 
project 
our year project addresses four major areas core information technology business systems including hardware and application software  other information technology infrastructure systems including hardware and application software  non information technology systems including facilities  production  research and development  and special purpose computer systems and external providers of materials or services 
state of readiness 
our year project is substantially complete 
north american core information technology business systems are operating on compliant hardware and software sap that replaced legacy systems 
european core information technology business systems are operating on legacy software that was remediated 
systems for latin american entities are operating on purchased software packages that are compliant 
other information technology infrastructure systems are generally current technology 
certain hardware primarily servers and pc s in north america under leases that expired on or before september  and software have been replaced with compliant versions or remediated 
non information technology systems are not materially affected by the year issue 
certain systems primarily those involved indirectly with north american manufacturing  ie  monitoring  analysis and testing have been replaced or remediated 
external providers of critical materials and services have been surveyed 
no material disruptions are expected 
products manufactured and or distributed by us do not utilize programmable logic to function and thus are not affected by the year issue 
costs to address year issues 
expenditures directly related to identification  evaluation and remediation of year exposures were million for fiscal and million for fiscal residual expenditures for fiscal are projected to be less than million 
capital expenditures for projects undertaken for other reasons  but which addressed year issues primarily sap  were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal other costs associated with these capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal risk of year issues 
the timing of a year related disruption would coincide with a seasonal low in our business cycle and thus have less impact on our business than it otherwise would during other parts of the cycle 
we estimate that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios are as follows we experience temporary disruption of local electrical utilities affecting our ability to operate our core information technology systems 
a portion of our non core information technology systems experiences temporary disruption 
this disruption is not expected to have a material impact on our ability to function 
a portion of our manufacturing operations experiences a temporary disruption 
this disruption is not expected to have a material impact on our ability to function 
a portion of our customer base experiences disruption 
this disruption could result in a reduction in sales but is not readily quantifiable 
a portion of our supplier base experiences disruption 
shipments from certain overseas suppliers are disrupted 
contingency plans 
we have developed contingency plans for each of the scenarios noted above 
these contingency plans  set forth in corresponding order  are as follows plans are in place to take incoming orders on an emergency basis and to continue shipment of existing orders utilizing alternative or manual systems 
since this disruption is not expected to have a material impact on our ability to function  no specific contingency plan has been developed 
we continue to expect that normal safety stock levels would cover this scenario  therefore no specific contingency plan has been developed 
since this disruption is not expected to have a material impact on our ability to function  no specific contingency plan has been developed 
we maintain alternate suppliers in the event of disruption of supply of a material or resource 
we expect that we could source from such alternates until our normal suppliers resume operations 
we have accelerated delivery of certain outstanding orders from these suppliers 
certain orders initially scheduled for shipment after december  are being accelerated to ship prior to december  in addition to the above contingency plans  personnel will be at key company facilities beginning the evening of december  to manage the transition from to planned measures include the shutdown of critical information technology and non information technology systems prior to midnight  confirmation of functioning utilities after midnight and orderly start up and testing of systems before resumption of operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we will adopt this accounting standard  as required  by october  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to mitigate the risk from such exposures 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note significant accounting policies and practices in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we have bank lines of credit at variable interest rates 
interest expense is primarily affected by the general level of us interest rates  libor  ibor  and to a lesser extent european base rates 
we use interest rate swaps to manage such risk 
the net amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change  and are recognized over the life of the swap agreements  as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counterparties are included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable 
foreign exchange risk we are subject to risk from sales and loans to our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with  third party customers  suppliers and creditors  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency sales are made primarily in pounds sterling  canadian dollars  german marks  french francs  italian lira  spanish pesetas  dutch guilders  mexican pesos  guatemalan quetzals  dominican pesos  venezuelan bolivars and honduran lempira 
foreign currency purchases are made primarily in pounds sterling  german marks  french francs  mexican pesos  dominican pesos  and guatemalan quetzals 
we manage our foreign exchange exposure from anticipated sales  accounts receivable  intercompany loans  firm purchase commitments and credit obligations through the use of naturally occurring offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange rate swaps 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counterparties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuation in market prices for purchases of zinc used in the manufacturing process 
we use commodity swaps  calls and puts to manage such risk 
the maturity of  and the quantities covered by  the contracts are closely correlated to our anticipated purchases of the commodities 
the cost of calls  and the premiums received from the puts  are amortized over the life of the contracts and are recorded in cost of goods sold  along with the effects of the swap  put and call contracts 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
sensitivity analysis the analysis below is hypothetical and should not be considered a projection of future risks 
earnings projections are before tax 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding interest rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable shift in the underlying interest rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in one year s interest expense on the related debt due to the same shift in interest rates  would be a net gain of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding foreign exchange rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying foreign exchange rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on future cash flows  after also including the gain in value on the related accounts receivable and contractual payment obligations outstanding at september  due to the same change in exchange rates  would be a net loss of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding commodity price derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying commodity prices would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in cost of one year s purchases of the related commodities due to the same change in commodity prices  would be a net gain of million
