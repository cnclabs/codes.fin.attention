in particular  the fourth quarter generally exhibits a slight tightening of customer spending habits commensurate with summer vacations  back to school needs and other factors 
conversely  the first quarter typically has a greater percentage of rentals because of traditional holiday shopping patterns 
management plans for these seasonal variances and takes particular advantage of the first quarter with product promotions  marketing campaigns  and employee incentives 
because many of the company s expenses do not fluctuate with seasonal revenue changes  such revenue changes may cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly earnings 
during the year ended september   the cost of rental merchandise  store lease rental expense and salaries and wages have increased modestly 
these increases have not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations because the company has been able to charge commensurately higher rental for its merchandise 
this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future
