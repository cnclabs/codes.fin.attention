recently issued accounting standards in april  the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this standard provides guidance on the financial reporting for start up costs and organization costs 
this standard requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application is encouraged 
the company adopted this standard on july  this statement will not have a significant effect on jackpot s results of operations or its financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes additional accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
presently  jackpot does not have any derivative instruments  nor does the company participate in hedging activities 
accordingly  sfas is not expected to have a significant effect on the results of operations or related disclosures 
results of operations overview route operations 
jackpot has a significant amount of its route operations at retail stores which are part of a group of affiliated store chains 
route operations revenues at two groups of affiliated store chains ie albertson s  inc and american stores company  which was the parent company of american drug stores  inc and lucky stores  inc until june each accounted for more than of jackpot s total revenues in each of fiscal  and the largest four store chains albertson s  inc  american drug stores  inc  kmart corporation and lucky stores  inc accounted for approximately of jackpot s total revenues in agreements with these four customers have expiration dates ranging from to such agreements provide jackpot the continued right to operate gaming machines at certain existing locations and future locations in nevada  if any  of such customers 
the loss or nonrenewal of any of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
in august  albertson s  inc and american stores company entered into a merger agreement that provided for the acquisition of american stores by albertson s 
approximately and of jackpot s total revenues for and  respectively  were generated at the locations of those two entities 
the merger of albertson s and american stores was completed on june  as a condition to obtaining approval of the merger by the federal trade commission and the attorneys general of california  nevada and new mexico  albertson s agreed to divest certain of its stores  including stores in southern nevada 
these locations have been taken over by raley s  inc jackpot operates in of the locations 
the existing slot route operator for raley s northern nevada stores has filed applications with the nevada gaming control board to operate the gaming machines at the southern nevada albertson s stores which are being divested 
of the stores in southern nevada taken over by raley s  jackpot currently maintains gaming machines at the locations which it operates pursuant to a long term agreement with albertson s 
jackpot believes that there is no proper basis to terminate such agreement and jackpot s attendant right to occupy the subject premises for purposes of operating gaming machines 
these locations generated approximately and of jackpot s total revenues for and  respectively  and a significantly greater percentage of jackpot s total operating income for and on august   jackpot commenced litigation in federal district court for the district of nevada against albertson s and raley s to enforce its rights under its agreement with albertson s 
on september   jackpot obtained a preliminary injunction to prevent albertson s and raley s from interfering with its right to occupy the subject premises and conduct gaming operations 
the court for purposes of its decision ruled that jackpot s license was coupled to the lease relating to the stores 
the injunction permits jackpot to remain at the stores pending resolution of the dispute 
in granting the preliminary injunction  the court required jackpot to post a  bond 
albertson s has now made an application to increase the bond to million 
in addition  albertson s and raley s have made motions for summary judgment 
furthermore  on september   raley s existing slot route operator commenced an action in nevada state court against jackpot  albertson s  raley s and the slot route operator at the four other albertson s southern nevada locations seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages 
the allegations against jackpot are for alleged fortuitous interference with contract and prospective economic advantage and abuse of process 
jackpot intends to vigorously defend this action 
no assurance can be given that such litigation will result in jackpot retaining the right to operate at the stores or not incurring liability as a defendant in the state action 
the loss of the locations could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
jackpot s operations in albertson s stores in other areas of nevada  as well as new store openings statewide  are unaffected 
the renewal or extension of agreements with major retail chains has generally resulted in increased monthly fees payable by jackpot 
these contracts often require fixed periodic increases in monthly fees during the term of the contract 
with respect to the accounting treatment of fixed periodic increases in monthly fees associated with these contracts  the company is required to average annual lease costs over the term of the contract 
as a result of such accounting treatment  annual lease costs generally increase significantly in the first year of an extended contract for the respective locations covered by the contract and  thereafter  remain constant for existing locations during the term of the contract 
in september  jackpot entered into an agreement for a long term contract extension with one of its largest retail store customers 
pursuant to the terms of the new agreement  which became effective july   rent expense will increase significantly over the previous agreement 
such increase could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the year ending june  license  lease and sublease agreements  representing agreements and approximately of route operations revenues  have terms expiring during despite a long term relationship with warehouse markets  inc  a significant customer  jackpot was not willing to agree with the terms sought for a contract extension  which management believed were uneconomic 
the agreement  which expired on june   involved the operation of approximately gaming machines in locations 
in  jackpot generated approximately of its total revenues and a significant amount of operating income from operations at such customer s locations 
in  jackpot entered into agreements for long term contract extensions  which became effective july   with four of its largest retail chain store customers  two of which were not due to expire on june  a very competitive pricing environment caused the company to offer significant increases in location rent over the existing agreements 
while was adversely affected by the loss of warehouse markets  inc and by significant increases in location rent  such effect was principally offset by increases in revenues generated at existing and new route operations locations 
casino operations 
on august   jackpot s board of directors approved a plan to dispose of the owl club and the pony express casino  the two casinos then operated by jackpot  as part of its strategy to exit its casino operations 
this decision was reached after considering that these casino operations generated unacceptably low returns on capital  possessed limited growth prospects and commanded a disproportionately high amount of management time 
on june   jackpot closed the owl club 
although the company continues to market these two properties for sale  no assurance can be given that such disposals will occur

year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation is generally referred to as the year problem 
if this situation occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
jackpot has conducted a review of its computer systems and other systems for the purpose of assessing its potential year problem  and is in the process of modifying or replacing those systems which are not year compliant 
based upon this review  management believes that the company s essential systems will be compliant on or about september  however  if modifications are not made or not completed timely  the year problem could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
in addition  jackpot has communicated with its major vendors and suppliers to determine their state of readiness relative to the year problem and jackpot s possible exposure to year issues of such third parties 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  which the company s systems may rely upon  will be timely converted or representations made to jackpot by these parties are accurate 
as a result  the failure of a major vendor or supplier to adequately address their year problem could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
all costs related to the year problem are expensed as incurred  while the cost of new hardware is capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
the costs associated with year compliance have not been and are not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as of june   the company had incurred costs of approximately  principally for internal costs and system applications  and anticipates spending an additional  to become year compliant 
the estimated completion date and remaining costs are based upon management s best estimates  as well as third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that such estimates will occur and actual results could differ

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk on march   the company purchased a total of  shares of common stock of players in an open market transaction 
the company acquired the shares of players common stock because the purchase price for those shares was significantly below the per share consideration which the company had agreed to pay for all outstanding shares of players pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of february   which provided for the merger of players into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
for further information concerning the termination of the merger with players and the purchase of players common stock by the company  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the shares of players which the company acquired are being held by the company pending consummation of the merger with harrah s entertainment  inc and players 
however  unless and until the merger is consummated or the company sells the players shares in the open market prior to the consummation of the merger  the company is exposed to equity price risk on those shares 
the company has not attempted to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on those shares 
a adverse change in the price of the players common stock from the price at june  would result in a decrease of approximately  in the fair value of players common stock owned by the company at june  except for the purchase described above  jackpot invests its available cash in marketable municipal bonds and money market funds 
no trading portfolios are available for the sale of these investments 
therefore  item a disclosure is not applicable for these investments
