for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities was  and funds from operations  which is equal to net income before allocation to minority interest  plus depreciation  less preferred share distributions  was  under federal income tax law provisions applicable to reits  the company is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to maintain its tax status as a reit 
in  the company declared distributions of  to its shareholders 
because the company s cash flow from operating activities is expected to exceed its taxable income due to depreciation and amortization expenses  the company expects to be able to meet its distribution requirements out of cash flow from operating activities 
the company s net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled  primarily relating to the purchase and development of the hotels and renovation of the acquired hotels 
during  the company spent  or of lessee room revenue  in connection with the renovation of its current hotels 
these capital expenditures were well in excess of the of room revenues for its hotels of room revenues and food and beverage revenues for one of its full service hotels which the company is required to spend under its percentage leases for periodic capital improvements and the refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment at its current hotels 
these capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flow  and possibly from borrowings under the company s line of credit  which sources are expected to be adequate to fund such capital requirements 
these capital expenditures are in addition to amounts spent on normal repairs and maintenance which have approximated and of room revenues in and  respectively  and are paid by the lessees 
the company s net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  totaled  this amount included  of proceeds from the closing of a loan through ge capital corporation in november   of proceeds from additional borrowings under its  line of credit and  of proceeds from borrowings under various demand notes 
these proceeds were offset in part by the payment of distributions to shareholders of  and the payment of distributions to the partnership s minority interest of  on february   the company entered into a new three year   line of credit agreement with a group of four banks led by wachovia bank of north carolina  na the company has collateralized the line of credit with of its current hotels 
the line of credit bears interest generally at rates from libor plus to libor plus  based primarily upon the company s level of total indebtedness 
the company s current rate is libor plus 
the company s articles of incorporation the articles limit its total amount of indebtedness to of the investments in hotel properties at cost  as defined in the articles 
in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders  the board of directors has recommended  and the shareholders will vote  with respect to an increase in the debt limitation contained in the articles to of the investments in hotel properties at cost  as defined in the articles 
the company intends to acquire and develop additional hotel properties that meet its investment criteria and is continually evaluating acquisition opportunities 
it is expected that future hotel acquisitions will be financed  in whole or in part  from additional follow on offerings  from borrowings under the line of credit  from joint venture agreements  from the sale of hotel properties and or from the issuance of other debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurances that the company will make an investment in any additional hotel properties that meet its investment criteria

this seasonality and the structure of the percentage leases  which provide for a higher percentage of room revenues above the minimum equal quarterly levels to be paid as percentage rent  can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
year management the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the computer programs of the company or one of its service providers  contractors  or suppliers  are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the company has identified its year risk in three categories internal software and embedded chip technology  external noncompliance by service providers  contractors and suppliers  and external noncompliance by franchisors and lessees 
internal software and embedded chip technology the company has begun its data gathering and testing phase with regard to internal software and embedded chip technology  with the assistance of its systems integration consultants 
virtually all of the company s internal software are current versions of off the shelf  name brand software 
the company s hardware systems  which include computer hardware  a phone system  copiers and facsimile machines  also contain embedded chip technology which could pose a risk of noncompliance 
the majority of this hardware has been installed in the last twelve months 
based on the results of our data gathering and tests to date  the cost of achieving year compliance is not expected to be material 
if any of the company s current software or hardware is not year compliant and is not repairable  the company plans to replace the respective software or hardware with readily available year compliant software or hardware 
full compliance is expected by the third quarter of external noncompliance by service providers  contractors and suppliers the company has identified and contacted its significant service providers  contractors and suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
it is expected that identification of any year exposure with these parties will be completed by april  to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company s contingency plan is to attempt to change significant service providers  contractors or suppliers to those who have demonstrated year readiness  but cannot be assured that it will be successful in finding such alternative service providers  contractors or suppliers 
the company has received information concerning the year compliance status of several of its significant service providers  contractors or suppliers 
at this time  some of the service providers  contractors and suppliers have indicated they are already year compliant  however  most have responded that they are in the process of becoming year compliant 
none have indicated that they will not be year compliant by december  in the event that any of the company s significant service providers  contractors or suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them with alternate service providers  contractors or suppliers  the company s business or operations could be materially and adversely affected 
external noncompliance by franchisors and lessees the company has significant relationships with certain nationally recognized hotel franchisors and lessees 
these franchisors have national reservation systems on which the company relies to receive a significant portion of its percentage lease revenue 
the company has contacted these franchisors and lessees to identify the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company has received initial responses that these franchisors and lessees are working on year compliance 
the company intends to follow up with the franchisors and lessees during the second quarter of to determine the extent of these third parties year readiness and to determine if any contingency plans of the company will be necessary 
in the event that any of these franchisors and lessees do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be materially and adversely affected 
historical costs incurred to address the year problem include approximately the company has not yet developed a final cost estimate related to fixing year issues
