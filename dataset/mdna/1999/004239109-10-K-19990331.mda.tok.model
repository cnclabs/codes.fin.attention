the company  along with most industry analysts  consider funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
generally  nareit defines ffo as net income loss before gains losses on sales of property  non recurring charges and extraordinary items  adjusted for certain non cash charges  primarily depreciation  amortization of capitalized leasing costs and equity income loss from joint ventures  and the addition of the proportionate share of ffo of unconsolidated joint ventures determined on a consistent basis

net cash provided by financing activities of million increased million compared to million used during the increase resulted primarily from million of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares and a million reduction in dividends and distributions paid in this was partially offset primarily by additional cash of million used in for the repayment of debt and a million decrease in cash provided by additional borrowings 
inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the statement  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance 
the company expects to adopt the statement effective january  the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
year compliance the year yk problem refers to computer applications using only the last two digits to refer to a year rather than all four digits 
as a result  these applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather than year the company has taken yk initiatives in three general areas which represent the areas that could have an impact on the company information technology systems  non information technology systems and third party issues 
the following is a summary of these initiatives information technology and related costs the company s information technology systems generally consist of file servers  workstations  operating systems and applications which are all purchased systems 
the company s assessment and testing of these systems has revealed that they are yk compliant 
furthermore  during  the company completed the installation of additional hardware and software purchased systems related to its accounting systems which are yk compliant as well 
these hardware and accounting software upgrade and conversions are being executed under maintenance and support agreements with vendors 
the total cost of the accounting conversion was approximately  non information technology and related costs non information technology consists mainly of facilities management systems such as telephone  utility and security systems for its properties 
the company is in the process of identifying date sensitive systems and equipment including hvac units  telephones  security systems and alarms  fire and flood warning systems and general office systems at its properties 
assessment and testing of these systems is approximately complete and is expected to be completed by no later than the second quarter of the identification and remediation of systems at the properties is being accomplished by company personnel with the assistance of consultants  for which both costs are being recorded as normal operating expense 
based on preliminary assessment the cost of any upgrades or replacement is not expected to be significant 
third parties and related costs the company has begun assessment of major third parties yk readiness including tenants  contractors and key suppliers of outsourced services including  property maintenance  stock transfer  debt servicing  banking collection and disbursement  payroll and benefits 
some of these third parties are publicly traded corporations subject to disclosure requirements for which the company currently monitors yk disclosures in sec filings 
the majority of the company s private vendors are small suppliers that the company believes can manually execute their business and are readily replaceable 
management also believes there is no material risk of being unable to procure necessary supplies and services 
the company has requested all significant vendors and tenants to complete yk questionnaires and to date has not received any response from such third parties indicating that they have a significant yk problem 
third party assessment is approximately complete and expected to be completed by the second quarter of the assessment of third party readiness is being conducted by company personnel whose costs are recorded as normal operating expenses 
the company is not yet in a position to estimate the cost of third party compliance issues to the company  but has no reason to believe that such costs will be material 
risks the principal risk to the company relating to the implementation of its accounting system hardware and software upgrades is failure to correctly bill tenants by december  and pay invoices when due 
management believes it has adequate resources  or could obtain the needed resources  to manually bill tenants and pay bills until the systems become operational 
the principal risks to the company relating to non information systems at the properties are failure to identify time sensitive systems and inability to find an appropriate replacement system 
the company believes that adequate replacement components or new systems are available at reasonable prices and are in good supply 
the company also believes that adequate time and resources are available to remediate these areas as needed 
the principal risks to the company in its relationship with third parties are failure of third party systems used to conduct business such as disruption of tenant operations at the properties  banks being unable to process receipts and disbursements  vendors being unable to supply needed materials and services to the company s properties  and processing of outsourced employee payroll 
based on yk compliance work done to date  the company has no reason to believe that key tenants  banks and suppliers will not be yk compliant in all material respects or cannot be replaced within an acceptable timeframe 
contingency plans the company intends to deal with contingency planning during the second quarter of after the results of the above assessments and related remediation are known 
the company s description of its yk compliance issue is based upon information obtained by management through evaluations of internal business systems and tenant and vendor compliance efforts 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to address the yk issues for all its systems in a timely manner or that it will not encounter unexpected difficulties or significant expenses relating to adequately addressing the yk issue 
if the company or the major tenants or vendors with whom the company does business fail to address their major issues  the company s operating results or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to the company s mortgage debt 
see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k for certain quantitative details related to the company s mortgage debt 
currently  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt 
as of december   the company had total mortgage debt of million of which  or  is fixed rate and million  or  is variable rate based upon either libor or the lender s commercial paper rate  plus certain spreads 
the company may seek variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  the company would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means
