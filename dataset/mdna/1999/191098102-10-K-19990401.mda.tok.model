year since many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors collectively  business systems use only two digits to represent the year  these business systems may be unable to process accurately certain data before  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year issue 
the year issue can arise at any point in the company s supply  manufacturing  distribution and financial chains 
the company began work on the year issue in the scope of the project includes ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on mainframe  personal computer  local area network and wide area network platforms  addressing issues related to non it embedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance and readiness of key suppliers and customers 
the project has four phases assessment of systems and equipment affected by the year issue  definition of strategies to address affected systems and equipment  remediation or replacement of affected systems and equipment and testing that each is year compliant 
with respect to ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on the company s various computer platforms  the assessment and definition of strategies phases have been completed 
it is estimated that of the remediation or replacement phase has been completed with the balance of this phase expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter the testing phase has begun and is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of approximately of internal application development resources were committed to year remediation efforts in and the company expects that approximately of its internal application development resources will be committed to this effort in the first quarter of the company has also utilized contract programmers to identify year noncompliance problems and modify code

approximately of the remediation or replacement phase has been completed with the balance of this phase expected to be completed by the middle of the third quarter testing is expected to be completed by the end of third quarter the company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials  water  utilities  transportation and other key services 
interruption of supplier operations due to year issues could affect company operations 
we have initiated efforts to evaluate the status of our most critical suppliers progress 
this process of evaluating our critical suppliers is scheduled for completion by mid options to reduce the risks of interruption due to supplier failures include identification of alternate suppliers and accumulation of inventory to assure production capability  where feasible or warranted 
these activities are intended to provide a means of managing and mitigating risk  but cannot eliminate the potential for disruption due to third party failure 
the company is also dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
year interruptions in our customers operations could result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels and cash flow reductions 
while these events are possible  the company s customer base is broad enough to minimize somewhat the effects of a single occurrence 
the company is in the assessment phase with respect to the evaluation management s discussion and analysis of critical customers progress and is scheduled for completion by mid the company has begun the process of developing contingency plans for those areas that are critical to our business 
these contingency plans will be designed to mitigate serious disruptions to our business flow beyond the end of  where possible 
the major efforts related to contingency planning will occur in the first nine months of it is currently estimated that the aggregate cost of the company s year efforts will be approximately million to million  of which approximately million has been spent to date 
these costs are being expensed as they are incurred and are being funded through operating cash flow 
these costs do not include any costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans  which are in the process of being developed 
the costs associated with the replacement of computerized systems  hardware or equipment currently estimated to be million  substantially all of which would be capitalized  are not included in the above estimates 
the company s year program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various components of the program described above are subject to change 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition
