year issues the year presents issues because many computer hardware and software systems use only the last two digits to refer to a calendar year 
consequently  these systems may fail to process dates correctly after december   which may cause systems failures 
state of readiness the company has conducted numerous internal discussions over the last eighteen months amongst its management and technical staff to informally assess the extent of the year issue on the company s operations 
in september   the company adopted a formal project to evaluate all of the company s systems for year compliance 
the project is being monitored and supervised by the company s chief operating officer

the company expects to have contacted all key suppliers and customers by march  however  we cannot guarantee or assure you that the systems of other companies that we rely on  such as suppliers of raw materials  electricity providers and other similar suppliers  or the customers who buy products from us  will effectively address their year issues 
in the event these suppliers and customers experience a disruption in their operations or cease operations indefinitely as a result of not addressing their year issues  our operations could be significantly impacted including the temporary or permanent cessation of operations 
costs to address the year issue the total cost to address the year issue  including the cost of company personnel and outside vendors and consultants is expected to be less than  to date the company has spent less than  to evaluate and address the year issue 
risks associated with the company s year issues the company utilizes a number of suppliers both large and small to provide raw materials and components for its products 
the failure of third party suppliers to become year compliant on a timely basis could create a need for the company to change suppliers or otherwise impair the sourcing of raw materials  components or services to the company  any of which could have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  the failure of the company s customers to become year compliant  could cause a disruption or termination of their operations which could result in a reduction or the elimination of order to purchase goods and services from the company 
either of the foregoing occurrences could have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
