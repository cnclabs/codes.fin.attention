item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in june to develop and commercialize its field emission displays 
since its inception  the company has been a development stage company devoting a majority of its resources to raising capital  conducting research and development activities  concluding cooperation and license agreements with certain displays manufacturers  including motorola inc motorola and futaba corporation futaba  and establishing manufacturing capabilities for its feds 
to date  most of the company s revenues have been cooperation and license revenues under these cooperation and license agreements and revenues from funding under grants from the french government and the european union 
in the future  the company expects to generate its revenue primarily from the sale of products manufactured by unipac under a contract manufacturing arrangement signed in may after adaptation of unipac s plant  including addition of certain equipment and extensive transfer of pixtech s proprietary manufacturing processes  unipac successfully manufactured fed samples in june while current shipments by unipac of feds are still minimal  the company expects that unipac will be successful in increasing manufacturing yields in and therefore that display shipments from unipac will exceed several thousand units per month by the end of however  the company does not expect to generate positive gross margins on the sale of its products in in view of the development stage of the company and the completion of the cooperation phase of existing cooperation and license agreements  the company expects to rely mainly on product sales to generate revenues in and believes that historical financial results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
page the company s expectations regarding its sources of future revenue are forward looking statements 
the amount  time and source of revenue generation will be affected by numerous matters including the availability of funds to finance its activities until volume shipments of products begin  the continued development of the company s products  including the enhancement of the display performance and the cost effective reproduction of the favorable characteristics demonstrated by the company s current prototypes in the context of commercial production  the successful transition of the company s prototype manufacturing processes to commercial manufacturing processes to achieve commercially viable yields  the successful development of a volume supply of fed products under contract manufacturing  the successful commercialization of feds by other members of the company s licensees  and the successful development of sufficient market demand for the company s products 
the company s products and its manufacturing processes are still in the early stages of development and testing 
to date  the company has only shipped limited quantities of products incorporating fed technology 
the company s only commercially available display is a inch monochrome display which to date has been sold in limited quantities to more than a hundred customers 
pursuant to a license agreement with the cea  the french atomic agency  the company is obligated to make royalty payments on its product sales and to pass through a portion of royalties on sales of royalty bearing products by the company s sublicensees 
pursuant to an amendment to the leti license agreement signed in the cea amendment  the royalty rates and minimum payments from the company to cea were temporarily increased for a period of three years 
a royalty amount of   and  was accrued in  in and in  respectively see notes to consolidated financial statements note related party transactions 
all of the company s expenses to date  except royalties and pass through expenses payable to cea and tax expenses directly associated with revenues from cooperation and license agreements  have been recorded as operating expenses  since the company has not shipped products in quantities sufficient to determine a meaningful cost of products sold category 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of million from inception to december  the company has incurred operating losses every quarter in  and  and expects to incur additional operating losses 
the magnitude and duration of the company s losses will depend on a number of factors within and outside of the company s control  including the rate at which it can successfully manufacture and commercialize its feds  if at all  and the related costs of such efforts 
successful commercialization of such displays will in turn depend on a number of factors  including the successful development of sufficient market demand for the company s products 
results of operations cooperation and license revenues 
the company recognized revenues under cooperation and license agreements of million in  million in and million in the significant decrease in cooperation and license revenues in and over reflects the achievement by the company at the end of of most of its contractual milestones 
the cooperation phase of these agreements  which had generated milestone revenues for the company  expired in june in the future  the company expects to derive royalty revenues only under existing cooperation and license agreements 
such royalty revenues will be based on licensees sales  if any  of royalty bearing products 
the company may grant royalty bearing licenses to the fed cross licensed technology to third parties subject to certain restrictions 
royalties payable to pixtech under such third party licenses will be shared with the existing licensees 
in  the company entered into a cooperation agreement with a major japanese crt manufacturer to demonstrate a inch fed display 
revenues generated under this agreement in and were included in cooperation and license revenues 
in february  the company entered into a subsequent cooperation agreement with its crt partner 
the company does not expect any significant revenues to be associated with such agreement 
page product sales 
the company recognized product sales of  in   in and  in through  these product sales primarily represented the shipment of a limited number of high priced fed displays and cathodes to customers for evaluation and product development purposes 
in  product revenues primarily reflected the shipment of displays to the company s first volume customer  zoll medical 
while the number of displays shipped increased significantly in over  the average selling price was reduced  reflecting commercially priced sales 
the company expects to increase product shipments in  mainly from its contract manufacturer  unipac 
other revenues 
other revenues consist of funding under european development contracts and other miscellaneous revenues 
other revenues were million in  million in and million in of these revenues    and million were related to a development contract granted in december from the french ministry of industry to support manufacturing of feds  in  and respectively 
the company successfully completed this development contract and will not derive any additional revenue from it 
in addition  the company expects to earn development contract related revenues in  primarily following expected recognition as income of certain amounts collected by the company before december   and previously recorded as deferred revenues see notes to consolidated financial statements note other and deferred revenues 
research and development expenses acquisition of intellectual property rights 
since its inception  the company expensed million for the acquisition of intellectual property rights from its licensees and other third parties 
in  the company expensed  in relation to a license agreement with coloray display corporation  a california corporation coloray  providing pixtech with a worldwide  nonexclusive royalty free license on certain technologies related to field emission displays 
other research and development expenses 
other research and development expenses include salaries and associated expenses for in house research and development activities conducted both in its pilot plant and its research and development facility in santa clara  the cost of staffing and operating the company s pilot manufacturing facility and since  the cost of supporting the transfer of the company s fed technology to unipac 
other research and development expenses also include obligations to cea under the leti research agreement  and miscellaneous contract consulting fees 
other research and development expenses increased from million and million in and respectively to million in this increase reflected the continued development of the company s fed technology  the cost of supporting the transfer and adjustment of its fed manufacturing processes to unipac  as well as the significant increase in the level of its pilot manufacturing activities to support early deliveries of its displays to customers 
sales and marketing expenses 
the company incurred sales and marketing expenses of million in  million in and million in the company believes sales and marketing expenses may increase in the future  reflecting the expansion of the company s sales and marketing organization both in the united states and in europe 
the company signed distribution agreements of its fed products respectively with sumitomo for the japanese and asian market areas in in  the company intends to progress on its efforts to conclude similar distribution agreements for both the united states and europe  in order to expand market reach in a cost effective manner 
such expectation regarding increased product shipments and customer contracts is a forward looking statement  the fulfillment of which is dependent on numerous factors 
see item business strategy 
in addition  in order to achieve its objectives  the company will need to expand its business rapidly and add sales  marketing  manufacturing  administrative and management personnel  as well as establish and manage its international operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  an increase of over general and administrative expenses incurred in  which amounted to million  reflecting an increase in staff expenses 
general and administrative expenses amounted to million in page interest income expense  net 
interest income is comprised of interest on available and restricted cash 
interest expense is comprised of interest payable on long term obligations 
net interest expense was  in  while the company recorded a net interest income of  in  and of  in  reflecting the increase in long term liabilities 
currency fluctuations 
although a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in us dollars  a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are denominated in euros 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in euros may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
most of the company s capital lease obligation is expressed in taiwanese dollars 
in  fluctuations of the parity of the taiwanese dollar versus the euro caused significant foreign exchange gains or losses and may continue to do so in the future 
the company recorded net foreign exchange gains of  in   in and in the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to date  the company has not undertaken hedging transactions to cover its currency exposure  but it may do so in the future 
income tax 
the company has recognized french income tax benefits of million since inception  including  in and million in these income tax benefits represent tax credits for research and development activities conducted in france and the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  net of valuation allowance 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was provided against a net deferred tax asset of million 
the tax credits for research and development activities will be paid in cash to the company if the company is not able to credit them against future income tax liabilities within three fiscal years 
the company collected  and million in and respectively  representing income tax benefits recorded in  and in and  respectively 
the company does not expect to record significant additional tax credits for research and development activities  if any  in the foreseeable future  as the benefit is based on increases in eligible research and development expenses in a given year over the two previous fiscal years 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards in france of approximately million of which million  million  million and million will expire in   and  respectively  if they are not utilized 
page quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each quarter in and in the opinion of the company s management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results set forth herein

in the past  these fluctuations have been caused by a variety of factors  including the rate of growth of the company s research and development activities  the rate of growth of the costs related to the transfer and adaptation of the company s manufacturing process to unipac  and the extent of foreign exchange gains or losses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has used million in cash to fund its operations from inception through december   and million in capital expenditures and investments 
through december   the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures primarily from sales of million of equity securities and million of proceeds from borrowings and sale leaseback transactions 
in  the company used million in cash to fund its operations and million in capital expenditures and investments 
page capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in in  capital expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvements  facility expansion  and equipment installed in its pilot manufacturing facility  while and capital expenditures remained focused on limited capacity expansion in the company s pilot line 
as of december   the company had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately  implementing volume production at unipac s manufacturing plant required significant capital expenditures 
an amount of million of capital expenditures for equipment only was required which  pursuant to the foundry agreement  was purchased and funded by unipac 
a portion of that equipment is leased to pixtech and amounts to million as of december  the company expects that additional capital expenditure will be required in to increase capacity at unipac and to complete implementation of manufacturing processes  both for monochrome and for color products 
restricted cash amounted to million in and was related to the security interest granted by the company to its taiwanese manufacturing partner  unipac  pursuant to the foundry agreement signed in  in relation to the purchase and funding by unipac of volume feds production equipment 
the written bank guaranty provided by the company to unipac is expected to decrease to match the net amount of equipment leased by unipac to the company 
the company has existing contracts with french authorities providing for the payment of grants to the company totaling approximately million  which were fully paid to the company as of december  in and january  the company entered into two r d agreements with french authorities 
under these agreements  the company expects to benefit from zero interest loans totaling approximately million  of which are expected to be collected in in february  the company entered into an r d agreement with the european union and other european industrial companies for months starting february  the contribution of the european union to the costs incurred by the company amounts to  over the period 
the company received  and  from this contribution respectively in and in  which were not recognized as income as all conditions stipulated in the agreement were not met 
in  the company received  in relation to another r d agreement entered into in with the european union and other european industrial companies 
the total contribution of the european union amounted to  the company received  in   in and  in from this contribution 
the company does not expect to derive any additional revenue from this contract 
the company recognized french income tax benefits of million since inception 
these income tax benefits represent tax credits for research and development activities conducted in france  which are paid in cash to the company if it is not able to credit them against future income tax liabilities within three fiscal years 
in  the company collected million  representing r d tax credits recorded in and in  the company expects to collect up to million from r d tax credits recorded in cash flows generated from financing activities were million in  as compared to million in these financings consisted primarily of sales of shares of common stock and of convertible preferred stock in private placements  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million net of issuance costs and million  respectively 
cash flow generated from financing activities exclude non cash transactions related respectively to i the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock to coloray display corporation with a value of  see notes to consolidated financial statements note stockholders equity and ii the dividends attached to the shares of convertible preferred stock in the amount of  see notes to consolidated financial statements note stockholders equity 
the company believes that cash available at december  together with the anticipated increase in product sales in and the anticipated proceeds during from r d tax credits and from the various grants and loans described above will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements  including repayment of the current portion of its long term obligations in the amount of million at december   until at least june  the company intends to improve its liquidity and financial position through capital increases expected to take place in page the company will require substantial funds to conduct research  development and testing  to develop and expand commercial scale manufacturing systems and to market any resulting products 
changes in technology or a growth of sales beyond currently anticipated levels will also require further investment 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which the company can develop its products  the market acceptance of such products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace and the response of competitors to the company s products 
there can be no assurance that funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing  or other sources  will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
outlook issues and risks the company is currently focused on the following activities which it believes are necessary to the success of its business 
successfully implementing the manufacture of feds by its taiwanese contract manufacturer  unipac  
improving its manufacturing processes and yields  both in its pilot plant and at unipac  
expanding its customer base and product offering  and 
continuing the development of its fed technology  including the development of large fed displays 
in evaluating its outlook  the following risks and issues should be considered  among others which are common among development stage companies such as its 
it is especially important to keep these risk factors in mind when reading forward looking statements 
these are statements that relate to future periods and include discussions relating to the company s market opportunities  acquisition opportunities  ability to compete  and stock price 
generally  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends and similar expressions identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and their actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of these and other factors 
forward looking statements are current only as of the date of this prospectus 
the company does not have any obligation to disclose if forward looking statements  or the circumstances they are based on  change 
the company may not have operating income or net income in the future and it may have problems raising the money it needs in the future since the company inception  the company has had significant operating losses 
during the year ended december   its net operating loss amounted to million  as compared to million during the year ended december  in the future  the company expects that it will need to obtain money from sources outside the company  as it has done in the past 
there is no guarantee that any of the outside sources will provide the company with the money when needed 
in addition  even if the company is able to find outside sources which will provide it with the money when needed  in order to raise this money the company may be required to issue securities with better rights than the rights of its common stock or it may be required to take other actions which lessen the value of its current common stock  including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to it 
there are risks associated with using a single contract manufacturer to manufacture its feds 
the company believes that its ability to commercialize medium to large volumes of feds depends on its ability to have unipac manufacture feds 
if the company is not able to implement its manufacturing plans with unipac as expected  the company will not be able to ship medium to large volumes of fed products 
furthermore  the company will not be able to obtain an acceptable cost for its fed displays through high volume manufacturing  as compared to manufacturing feds at its pilot production facility 
this situation would materially adversely affect its operations 
in may  the company signed a foundry agreement with unipac  a liquid crystal display manufacturer based in taiwan 
under the agreement  unipac has installed volume production equipment to produce feds at its manufacturing plant  and has begun production for exclusive delivery of fed displays to the company 
expectations about the final timing of this manufacturing plan with unipac are forward looking statements that still involve risks and uncertainties  including the ease or difficulty of the transfer of the fed technology to unipac 
page the company s reliance on a single contract manufacturer will involve several risks 
for example  the company could be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required products if unipac did not supply enough products 
moreover  the company will have less control over the price of the finished products  the timeliness of their delivery and their reliability and quality 
the company s failure to adequately manage this contract manufacturing relationship or any delays in the shipment of its products would adversely effect the company 
the company s products and manufacturing processes are still under development and the company still needs to obtain commercially acceptable yields and acceptable costs of products 
in order for the company to succeed  it must continue to develop and produce a range of products incorporating its fed technology 
at this time  the company has successfully developed only one product that has been incorporated into a commercial end user application 
the company will need to complete the development of additional fed products before they can be sold to the public  and there is no guaranty that the company will succeed in these development efforts 
if the company does not develop these new products  it will not be successful 
the company has used its pilot manufacturing facility in montpellier  france to produce only a limited number of products suitable for sale 
additionally  the company has not completed testing of its manufacturing processes at unipac 
in order for the company to be successful  it must make certain improvements to its manufacturing processes 
in particular  it must improve its manufacturing yields in order to demonstrate the low cost potential of its fed technology 
even if the company succeeds in completing the development and testing of its manufacturing processes  it can not be sure that the favorable characteristics demonstrated by its current displays manufactured at its pilot manufacturing facility will be reproduced on a cost effective basis in commercial production 
the company has  at this time  encountered a number of delays in the development of its products and processes  and it is possible that further delays will occur 
any significant delays could cause the company to miss certain market opportunities and could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company needs to further enhance its display performance 
the company may never improve the performance characteristics of its color feds to a level that is commercially acceptable or fail to do so on a timely basis  either of which could adversely affect its business 
key elements of display performance are brightness  power efficiency and stability over time life time and reliability 
the company is seeking to balance brightness with power efficiency to produce bright and low power consumption displays 
display reliability depends heavily on the manufacturing process used in assembling the displays as well as the characteristics of the phosphors used in the display 
in order to produce color displays that will provide the product life and other characteristics necessary for most applications  the company needs to make further advances in its manufacturing processes 
the company face intense competition and needs to compete with current and future competing technologies 
the company s competitors may succeed in developing products that outperform its displays or that are more cost effective 
if its competitors develop products that offer significant advantages over its products and if the company is unable to improve its technology  or develop or acquire alternative technology that is more competitive  it would be adversely affected 
page the market for flat panel display  or fpd  products is currently dominated by products utilizing liquid crystal display  or lcd  technology 
certain lcd manufacturers  such as sharp  nec and hitachi  have substantially greater name recognition and financial  technological  marketing and other resources than us 
furthermore  lcd manufacturers have made  and continue to make  substantial investments in improving lcd technology and manufacturing processes and in the construction of manufacturing facilities for displays 
the company believes that  over time  this will have the effect of reducing average selling prices of fpds 
in addition  recently there have been substantial increases in the worldwide manufacturing capacity of fpds  and new competitors have entered the fpd market 
such changes may cause over supply conditions leading to dramatic reductions in the price of fpds 
in order to effectively compete  the company could be required to increase the performance of its products or reduce prices 
in the event of price reductions  the company will not be able to maintain gross margins unless it reduces its cost of sales 
there are a number of domestic and international companies developing and marketing display devices using alternative technologies to lcd technology  such as vacuum fluorescent displays  electro luminescent panels and plasma panels 
in addition  the company has ended its cooperation phase with both futaba and motorola in january and june  respectively  and is aware of significant continued investments in fed technology development by each of them 
in the future  the company expects to face competition from both of them 
additionally  some of the basic fed technology is in the public domain and  as a result  the company has a number of potential direct competitors developing fed displays 
the company is aware of several other companies which are developing fed technologies similar to its technology  including sony  fujitsu  and samsung as well as smaller companies  including candescent  fed corporation  and micron display division  a division of micron display technology 
although the company owns the rights to significant technological advances in fed technology  potential competitors may have developed or may soon develop comparable or superior fed technology 
many of the developers of alternative fpd and competing fed technologies have substantially greater name recognition and financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company  and have made and continue to make substantial investments in improving their technologies and manufacturing processes 
potential customers may not accept the company s products 
the company is uncertain about the potential size and timing of its target market opportunities 
it anticipates marketing its displays to original equipment manufacturer or oem customers its success will depend  in part  on the following factors 
whether oems select its products for incorporation into their products  
the successful introduction of such products by the oems  and 
the successful commercialization of products developed by parties incorporating its products 
it is possible that demand for any particular product will not last or that new markets will fail to develop as the company expects  or at all 
such deviations would materially and adversely effect the company 
it takes a long time for any product to achieve market success  and such success is never certain 
the introduction of new products is often delayed by the need to have the products selected by an oem and designed into the oem s products 
for certain products  the delay attributable to a manufacturer s design cycle may be a year or longer 
factors affecting the length of these delays include 
the size of the manufacturer  
the type of application  and 
whether the displays are being designed into new products or fitted into existing applications 
page if volume production of such products is delayed for any reason  the company s competitors may introduce new technologies or refine existing technologies which could diminish the commercial acceptance of its products 
the company has made efforts to design its products to be compatible with the electronic products with which they will be used and has targeted smaller markets where the design cycle may be shorter 
however  unforeseen difficulty in incorporating the company s products and technology  would lessen the commercial acceptance of its products 
furthermore  its oems will probably require the company to implement certain manufacturing quality control procedures as well as prove its ability to manufacture the number of displays they require on a timely and reliable basis 
the company s failure to meet these requirements could have an adverse impact on its relationships with these oems and could prevent it from establishing relationships with other oems 
future cooperation and license revenues may decrease 
the company has entered into various license agreements under which the company was paid money for achieving certain milestones 
at this time  the company has recorded all expected revenues associated with these milestone payments 
if the company fails to conclude new royalty bearing licenses or cooperation agreements  it could be adversely affected 
the company must execute further cooperation and or license agreements with third parties that are not existing licensees before it will receive any future cooperation or license revenues 
should the company successfully enter such agreements  a portion of the revenues from such contracts may need to be shared with the existing licensees 
in addition  the company will only recognize royalty revenues under cooperation and license agreements with existing or future licenses if any of its licensees incorporate licensed technology into products that are successfully commercialized 
the company can not guarantee that any of its licensees will successfully develop or commercialize any fed products 
the company believes that one of its existing licensees  raytheon company  may have suspended its internal program to develop feds 
the company may have difficulty protecting patents and other proprietary rights to its technology 
the company has been granted  has filed applications for  and has been licensed under a number of patents in the united states and other countries 
however  rights granted under patents may not provide the company with any competitive advantage over competitors with similar technology  and any issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect against these competitors 
the company has not conducted an independent review of patents issued to other companies 
the company cannot be certain that it was the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue and the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
competitors in both the united states and other countries may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with its ability to make and sell its products 
moreover  claims that its products infringe on the proprietary rights of others are more likely to be asserted after the company begins commercial sales of products using its technology 
although the company believes that its products do not infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  it is possible that third parties will assert infringement claims against us and that such claims will be successful 
it is also possible that competitors will infringe its patents 
even the successful defense and prosecution of patent suits is costly and time consuming 
the adverse outcome of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to other parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to stop selling its products 
the company also relies on unpatented  proprietary technology which is significant to the development and manufacture of its displays 
others may independently develop the same or similar technology or obtain access to its unpatented technology 
to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information  the company requires employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
it is possible that the agreements may be breached  that the company would not be fully compensated for any such breach  or that its trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently developed or discovered by competitors 
if the company is unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies  its business could be adversely affected 
page the company has received correspondence from futaba corporation and its legal counsel beginning in february alleging the following 
the company is infringing one or more patents owned by futaba relating to the construction and manufacture of its displays that are not expressly included under the license agreement between the company and futaba  
its use of terms such as alliance and partners in describing the nature of its contractual relationships with motorola  raytheon and futaba in reports filed with the sec is misleading  and 
certain provisions in the foundry agreement with unipac constitute an impermissible sublicense of futaba technology 
the company does not believe such claims have any merit and have denied each of the allegations in correspondences with futaba and its counsel 
futaba has also claimed that the company improperly supplied certain futaba proprietary information to unipac  and that unipac has  in turn  disclosed such information to a third party vendor 
if futaba prevails on any of these claims  the company may be required  among other adverse consequences  to modify the construction and manufacture of its displays and may  as a result  be materially adversely affected 
currency fluctuations may cause gains or losses 
a large percentage of its net assets and of the company s costs is expressed in euros 
fluctuations of the value of the us dollar versus the euro may cause significant foreign exchange gains or losses 
most of the company s capital lease obligation is expressed in taiwanese dollars 
fluctuations of the value of the taiwanese dollar versus the euro or the us dollar may cause significant foreign exchange gains or losses 
the company may be affected by year errors in computer systems 
there is a significant uncertainty regarding the effect of the year issue because computer systems which do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to could generate erroneous data or altogether fail 
the company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of its computer systems and manufacturing equipment to identify applications that could be affected by the inability of certain computer systems to format and manipulate data containing dates including the year and subsequent years 
although management does not expect that costs associated with modifying existing computer systems and manufacturing equipment will have a significant impact on its financial position or result of operations  there can be no assurance that such modifications will be successfully implemented or that these costs will not be significant 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year review 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion during and determine whether such a plan is necessary 
in addition  the company depends on a limited group of suppliers 
there can be no assurance that those suppliers will not be significantly impacted by the year issue 
if those suppliers are significantly impacted by the year issue  such suppliers may not be able to continue their supply of parts to the company without interruption 
the company is in the process of identifying third party vendors that are non year compliant and of assessing the following consequences 
in particular  the company requested from unipac  its taiwanese manufacturing partner  to assess whether its computer systems and manufacturing equipment could be affected by the year issue and  if so  to present a contingency plan 
to implement its large volume manufacturing strategy  the company is dependent on unipac s ability to be successful in addressing the year issue 
the company s continued use of a vendor which is not year compliant or the failure of the company s own computer systems or manufacturing equipment to be fully year compliant could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
page holders of common stock may face significant dilution from the conversion of series e preferred shares 
in december  the company issued  shares of series e preferred stock the series e stock  at a price of per share  to certain institutional investors 
the series e stock is generally convertible after june  into common stock at a rate equal to the lesser of a  and b the average closing price common stock over the ten trading day ending period ending on the day immediately preceding the day upon conversion 
as of march st   the series e stock would have been convertible into  shares of common stock 
should the company s stock price fall below  conversion of series e stock may result into the issuance of a significant additional number of shares of common stock  and may cause significant dilution to current holders of common stock 
certain anti takeover provisions may limit the company s stock price certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage a third party from offering to purchase the company 
these provisions  therefore  inhibit actions that would result in a change in control of the company  including an action that may give the holders of the common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of their stock 
these provisions may also adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
for example  under its certificate of incorporation  the company can issue blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as determined by its board of directors from time to time 
this type of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
in addition  the preferred stock issued by the company in december and any additional shares of preferred stock that the company may issue in the future may adversely affect the voting and dividend rights  rights upon liquidation and other rights of the holders of common stock 
the company does not currently intend to issue any additional shares of preferred stock  but it retains the right to do so in the future 
furthermore  the company is subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which may discourage takeover attempts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk exposure inherent to the company s international operations creates potential for losses arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to such foreign currency exchange rate risk in two main areas i a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are and are expected to be denominated in euros  ii most of the company s capital lease obligation is expressed in taiwanese dollars 
fluctuations of the parity of the taiwanese dollar versus the euro or the us dollar may cause significant foreign exchange gains or losses 
in addition  gains and losses arising from the conversion to us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in euros or in taiwanese dollars may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
to date  the company has not undertaken hedging transactions to cover its currency exposure
