item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere herein 
the information set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements below 
overview the company is a full range air filtration product company engaged in designing  manufacturing and marketing high performance  mid range and standard grade air filtration products and certain related products and services 
the company focuses on those products with high replacement potential 
the company designs and manufactures its own production equipment and also produces glass based media for many of its products 
from to  the company experienced significant growth from the acquisition of other air filtration related companies 
as of june   the company acquired eco air 
eco air specializes in the manufacture and sale of air filtration products to markets on the west coast ranging from high end hepa filters through standard grade filters 
the results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in the company s financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  the company s historical results of operations for the periods presented should be evaluated specifically in the context of the acquisitions 
additionally  the historical results of operations do not fully reflect the operating efficiencies and improvements expected from upgrading and integrating the acquired businesses into the company s operations 
there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to achieve these objectives and gains in efficiency 
the company believes the acquisitions will have a positive impact on its future results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and year ended december  december  net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income   income before income taxes   income taxes   net income   net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  for  from  for the increase in net sales was due to i the acquisition of eco air  which contributed approximately  of net sales  and ii the company s success in attracting work and expanding its original core business  which grew by approximately between and and contributed an additional  to net sales 
the company experienced reductions in sales of its laminar flow hepa products for cleanroom applications  which were balanced by increased sales of its ashrae rated mid range products for industrial and commercial applications 
gross profit gross profit for increased  or  to  which represented of net sales  compared to  which represented for the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit margin percentage were i the consolidation of the company s airpure facility  located in selma  north carolina  into the company s new facility in nearby smithfield  north carolina  which took place during the fourth quarter of and resulted in extended periods of downtime due to equipment movement  calibration and production flow refinement  as well as other direct costs associated with moving equipment and inventory from the old facility to the new plant  ii higher than normal costs  mostly during the first three quarters of  associated with new facilities in henderson  nevada and smithfield  north carolina  consisting primarily of labor inefficiencies associated with training new production employees and installation of new equipment  iii higher than normal freight costs associated with shipping products from established facilities to meet demand from new geographical areas while additional equipment was installed in various plants  and iv inefficiencies associated with irregular orders and slowdowns at ffi s facility in washington  north carolina 
these decreases in gross profit were partially balanced by efficiencies associated with the company s ongoing automation project for stock product lines  which is substantially complete for the company s highest volume products 
operating expenses operating expenses during the year ended december  increased  or to  representing of net sales  compared to  for the year ended december   which represented of net sales 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of eco air  which added approximately  in operating expenses 
excluding eco air  operating expenses increased  from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  major factors affecting operating expenses included approximately  in research and development expenditures for the development of new product lines  compared to approximately  in  the consolidation and centralization of overhead functions  and increased sales commission expense associated with increase sales 
net income net income for the year ended december  decreased  or  to  or per share basic diluted  compared to  or per share basic diluted  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to the company s decrease in profit margin as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and december year ended december  december  net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income   income before income taxes   income taxes   net income   net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to the acquisitions and establishment of new subsidiaries  which contributed approximately  of net sales 
excluding the acquisitions  comparable sales from the company s business at december  to december  were up approximately  or 
the company believes this is slower than normal growth for its industry  which it estimates grew between and during  and attributes its lower than expected growth to a cyclical downturn in demand for new semiconductor production facilities 
because of this cyclical slowdown  the company redirected underutilized capacity normally used in the manufacture of high end filtration products for semiconductor cleanrooms to containment environments for the pharmaceutical industry and mid range industrial hepa products 
gross profit gross profit for increased by  or  to  which represented of net sales  from  in  which represented of net sales 
the primary reasons for the decrease in gross margin percentage were i higher than normal costs associated with opening new facilities in momence  illinois and henderson  nevada  which consisted primarily of labor inefficiencies associated with training new production employees  ii higher than normal freight costs associated with shipping products from facilities on the east coast to meet demand from new customers while the new facilities were in their startup phase  and iii higher than normal costs associated with changing portions of the company s high end production facilities to emphasize production of containment environments for the pharmaceutical industry and mid range industrial hepa filters instead of high end filtration products for the semiconductor industry 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased by  or  to  which represented of net sales  from  in  which represented of net sales 
the primary reasons for the overall increase in operating expenses were the acquisitions and the establishment of airseal west  which together accounted for  of the increase 
operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales compared to  primarily due to the impact of savings associated with the consolidation of operations of the various subsidiaries 
other factors affecting operating expenses included an increase in sales commissions related to the increase in sales volume  additional travel and management expenses associated with establishing new facilities  and expenses incurred developing and marketing new containment and filtration products

net income net income for increased by  or  to  or per share basic diluted  from  or per share basic diluted for effects of inflation the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was  at december   compared to  at december  this includes cash and cash equivalents of  and  at december  and  respectively 
trade receivables increased  or  to  at december  from  at december  the largest factor in the increase in receivables is the acquisition of eco air  which accounted for approximately  of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily due to increases associated with the increased volume in net sales approximately  and timing differences in shipments and payments received 
operations used  of cash during the year ended december   compared to generating  for the year ended december  the difference in cash flows was associated with increased receivables and inventories  partially offset by income net of depreciation and amortization 
financing activities during generated  of cash  primarily from debt financing 
investing activities during consumed  of cash  consisting primarily of the purchase of property  plant and equipment  largely consisting of machinery for the automation of the company s production facilities  and cash paid for the acquisition of eco air  which was effective june  the purchase price  including expenses  was approximately  plus up to  payable in cash or the company s common stock at sellers option if certain performance criteria are met 
if eco air achieves certain performance criteria  flanders will issue common stock or record a liability for the cash payment over a five year period and flanders will add the amount to goodwill associated with the purchase transaction and amortize it over the remaining amortization period of the goodwill asset 
the acquisition of eco air was funded by utilizing a revolving credit facility which provides a line of credit up to a maximum principal amount of  the effective date of the acquisition for financial statement purposes was june   and the company s financial statements include the operating activities and assets of eco air from that date 
as of december   no shares have been issued or liability recorded to the eco air sellers as a result of achieving performance criteria 
the company has arranged a revolving line of credit facility with suntrust 
the credit agreement is for a term of two years and provides the company with a line of credit up to a maximum principal amount of  outstanding balances on the credit line bear interest at the option of the company  at either a the prime rate of interest publicly announced by suntrust bank  or b the libor rate as reported by the wall street journal plus an amount equal to to  depending on the ratio of total liabilities of the company to its tangible net worth 
as of december   this rate was 
as of december   the company had used  of the revolving credit facility 
unless this line of credit is renewed  it will expire in february in addition  eco air  a subsidiary of the company has a line of credit agreement with a bank which allows for advances based on of eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum of  of which  was outstanding at december  borrowings under this arrangement are collateralized by substantially all of eco air s assets 
outstanding amounts on the line of credit bear interest at a combination of libor plus and the bank s prime rate 
eco air may elect to fix the rate for any or all advances under this line of credit agreement for a term of to days at the then current libor rate plus  and has made such an election at the day libor rate at december  
as of april   the company entered into a loan agreement and issued a note to the johnston county industrial facilities and pollution control financing authority and such authority issued industrial development revenue bonds the bonds for an aggregate of  the proceeds of which were loaned to the company for the construction of a  square foot manufacturing facility in johnston county  north carolina 
the note extends for a term of fifteen years and bears interest at a variable rate determined by the remarketing agent of the bonds on a weekly basis equal to the minimum rate necessary to sell such bonds at their par value which  as of december   was per annum 
the bonds are collateralized by a  letter of credit which expires october continuing expansion of the company will require substantial capital investment for the manufacture of filtration products 
although the company has been able to arrange debt facilities or equity financing to date  there can be no assurance that sufficient debt financing or equity will continue to be available in the future  or that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely impact the company s growth strategy 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of the company s common stock 
as of march   the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock under this authorization  thus  as of this date  up to an additional  shares are available for repurchase 
these shares may be acquired in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
these repurchases may be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
these repurchases are to be used primarily to satisfy the company s obligations under its stock option and purchase plans or any other authorized incentive plans  or for issuance pursuant to future equity financing by the company 
outlook the company believes that the semiconductor industry has been experiencing a cyclical slowdown in capital spending for new facilities  and thus on spending for cleanroom filtration products  since the first quarter of while the company does expect capital spending for new semiconductor facilities to increase in the future  it does not expect this to be a significant factor in the company s overall business during  where sales for semiconductor plants are expected to remain flat through at least the third quarter 
data collected by the company indicates that residential filter users replace their filters  on average  approximately once per year 
manufacturers of residential furnace and air conditioning systems recommend that these filters be changed every month 
a minor trend toward increased maintenance of these residential heating and cooling systems could have a positive impact on the company s business 
the company s most common products  in terms of both unit and dollar volume  are residential throw away spun glass filters  which usually sell for prices under 
any increase in consumer concern regarding air pollution  airborne pollens  allergens  and other residential airborne contaminants could result in replacement of some of these products with higher value products  such as the company s anti microbial or higher efficiency filters for residential use  with associated sales prices typically over each 
any such trend would have a beneficial effect on the company s business 
the company s recent development  in conjunction with church dwight  the makers of arm hammer baking soda products  of its arm hammer pleated filters for residential use  is also aimed toward increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of using a more effective  but more expensive  filter  and replacing it more frequently 
the company hopes that the dramatic and readily recognizable difference in efficacy between a fresh arm hammer pleated filter  and one which has been in place for three or more months will help to encourage the public to become more aware of these issues 
currently  the largest domestic market for air filtration products is for mid range ashrae rated products and hvac systems  typically used in commercial and industrial buildings 
to date  the company s penetration of this market has been relatively small 
the company believes that its ability to offer a one stop supply of air filtration products to hvac distributors and wholesalers will increase its share of this market segment 
the company also believes its recently developed modular air handlers and environmental tobacco smoke systems will enable it to expand sales to these customers  the new products will serve as high profile entrants with distributors and manufacturers representatives  who can then be motivated to carry the company s complete product line 
the foregoing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including i the shortage of reliable market data regarding the air filtration market  ii changes in external competitive market factors or in the company s internal budgeting process which might impact trends in the company s results of operations  iii anticipated working capital or other cash requirements  iv changes in the company s business strategy or an inability to execute its strategy due to unanticipated changes in the market  v product obsolescence due to the development of new technologies  vi various competitive factors that may prevent the company from competing successfully in the marketplace and vii other risks described below in factors that may affect future results 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k will in fact occur 
factors that may affect future results the company operates in a highly competitive market and is subject to a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
while the company s management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook 
see part i business forward looking statements and associated risks 
integration of acquired companies 
prior to their acquisition by the company  csc  air seal  precisionaire and eco air operated under different management philosophies  management teams and marketing strategies 
these companies operations are currently being integrated into the company s  and there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to accommodate integration of these companies 
failure to successfully integrate these companies could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
management of growth 
with the company s recent acquisitions  the company s net sales increased by approximately from the year ended december  to the year ended december   and approximately from the year ended december  to the year ended december  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to expand at this rate  or at all 
if the company continues to grow  the additional growth will place burdens on management to manage such growth while maintaining the company s profitability 
additional growth may require the company to recruit and train additional management personnel in the areas of corporate management  sales  accounting  marketing  research and development and operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
both the company s growth by acquisition and any further expansion may also significantly strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations and growth 
acquisition strategy 
the company intends to continue to increase its market share through strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses 
the company seeks to identify potential acquisition targets with i dominant positions in local or regional markets  ii a stable customer base distinct from the company s existing customers  iii financial stability  iv an ability to add new product lines to the company s business  and v significant asset value to enable the company to obtain debt financing or non dilutive equity financing for the acquisition 
the company is continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities in light of the above criteria 
the company focuses on those acquisition targets which complement the company s existing technology  increase market share  or broaden distribution channels 
the company also seeks acquisition targets which provide vertical integration opportunities 
the company s strategy of growth through acquisition exposes the company to the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
although the company generally has been successful in pursuing these acquisition targets  there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the company will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions  that the company will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 
the company currently has no binding agreements with respect to future acquisitions  but is continuing to investigate potential acquisition opportunities 
need for additional financing for future acquisitions 
the company believes that the revenues from current operations will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
however  to continue its growth through acquisition  substantial additional debt or equity financing may be needed 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely affect the company s acquisition strategy 
need for technical employees 
the company s future operating results depend in part upon its ability to retain and attract qualified engineering  manufacturing  technical  sales and support personnel for its operations 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain such persons could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
technological change  new product introduction 
as of december   approximately of the company s net sales resulted from sales of high end filtration products which are especially vulnerable to new technology development 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to anticipate technological changes  to develop new and enhances filtration systems and to introduce these systems at competitive prices in a timely and cost efficient manner 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully anticipate future technological changes or that technologies or systems developed by others will not render the company s technology obsolete 
the company also plans to develop new products as part of its strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing the new products or that any product developed will be commercially viable 
acquiring and maintaining equipment 
the company designs  manufactures and assembles the majority of the automatic production equipment used in its facilities 
the company also uses other technologically advanced equipment  for which manufacturers may have limited production capability or service experience  which could result in delays in the acquisition and installation of such equipment or extended periods of down time in the event of malfunction or equipment failure 
any such extended period of down time for any critical equipment could have a material adverse impact on the company  its financial condition and operations 
product demand 
approximately of the company s net sales in were from high end products sold for use in the semiconductor industry 
the company believes that new manufacturing plant construction for the semiconductor industry  which typically occurs in large phases as new manufacturing capacity is needed  is in a periodic slowdown 
as such  the demand for the company s laminar flow hepa products may be less in future years than previous years 
potential environmental risks 
the company s business and products may be significantly influenced by the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations  which require that certain environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
while the company endeavors at each of its facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company s operations or activities  or historical operations by others at the company s locations  will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
competition 
the company currently faces significant competition in its business activities  and this competition may increase as new competitors enter the market 
several of these competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing or new entrant companies 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition resulting in lower prices and profit margins  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success will depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of its officers and key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the company has entered into employment agreements with robert r 
amerson  its president and chief executive officer  steven k 
clark  its chief financial officer and chief operating officer  and leonard j 
fetcho  its vice president of operations 
the loss of any key person could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
distribution channels 
the acquisitions give the company a broader assortment of air filtration products 
as part of the integration of the acquisitions  the company has adopted a strategy of increasing its market share by providing its manufacturers representatives with the ability to offer a full product line of the company s products and one stop purchasing of air filtration products to existing and new customers 
many of the company s representatives have indicated a willingness to offer the company s products exclusively now that the company offers a broader range of products  however  these representatives may decide to work exclusively with some other company for various reasons  thus  the current distribution channels would be unavailable 
automation 
in  the company began a program to increase its gross margins by automating portions of its production lines at ffi and precisionaire using technology and designs developed in house 
currently  this process is substantially complete for its standard grade spun glass filters  the company s largest volume product line 
the company estimates that it has expended approximately of the amounts required to complete its automation program 
although the designs have been extensively tested in the field  there can be no assurance that the new equipment will have the beneficial results on gross margins that have been budgeted  or that any increases in efficiencies will not be offset in the marketplace by competitors making similar improvements to their facilities 
new products and new markets 
the company has recently invested a significant amount of time  money and reputation on the development of new product lines to i control indoor tobacco smoke  ii remove airborne odors in residences using impregnated baking soda in filters  and iii allow replacement of certain classes of outdated hvac equipment without structural demolition or rework 
the company believes there is currently a gradually increasing public awareness of the issues surrounding iaq  and that this trend will continue for the next several years 
the company believes there is an increase in public concern regarding the effects of iaq on employee productivity  as well as an increase in interest by standards making bodies in creating specifications and techniques for detecting  defining and solving iaq problems 
the company believes there will be an increase in interest in its absolute isolation barriers in the future because these products prevent cross contamination between different lots and different processes being performed at the same facility  as well as increasing production yields in many applications 
there can be no assurance that these products will gain acceptance in the marketplace  or that any new products developed by the company will be successful 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to recoup the expenditures associated with the development of these products 
centralize overhead functions 
the company has begun to implement plans to centralize and eliminate duplication of efforts between its subsidiaries in the following areas purchasing  production planning  shipping coordination  marketing  accounting  personnel management  risk management and benefit plan administration 
there can be no assurance that cutting overhead in this fashion will have the anticipated benefits  or that these reorganizations will not significantly disrupt the operations of the affected subsidiaries 
the company believes centralizing these overhead functions will have a beneficial impact upon its future operating results 
year the problem the year issue is the result of potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips that store that year portion of the date as just two digits eg  for 
systems using this two digit approach will not be able to determine whether represents the year or the problem  if not corrected  will make those systems fail altogether or  even worse  allow them to generate incorrect calculations causing a disruption of normal operations 
readiness efforts in  the company began a comprehensive project plan to address the year issue as it relates to its operations 
this plan was developed  approved by the board of directors  and implemented 
the scope of the plan includes five phases awareness  evaluation  hardware implementation  phased software implementation and validation 
a project team that consists of key members of the technology staff  representatives of functional business units and senior management was developed 
additionally  the duties of the director of information technology were realigned to serve primarily as the year project manager 
an assessment of the impact of the year issue on the company s computer systems has been completed 
the scope of the project also includes other operational and environmental systems since they may be impacted if embedded computer chips control the functionality of those systems 
from the assessment  the company has identified and prioritized those systems deemed to be mission critical or those that have a significant impact on normal operations 
the company relies on third party vendors and service providers for its data processing capabilities and to maintain its computer systems 
formal communications with these providers and other external parties were initiated in to assess the year readiness of their products and services 
their progress in meeting their targeted schedules is being monitored for any indication that they may not be able to address the problems in time 
thus far  responses indicate that most of the significant providers currently have compliant versions available or are well into the renovation and testing phases with completion scheduled for some time in early however  the company can give no guarantee that the systems of these service providers and vendors on which the company s systems rely will be timely renovated 
additionally  the company has implemented a plan to manage the potential risk posed by the impact of the year issue on its major customers 
formal communications have been initiated  software modifications have been initiated  and testing has been successfully completed with several of the company s major customers 
testing is scheduled to be substantially complete by june  current status the project team estimates that the company s year readiness project is complete  and that the activities involved in assessing external risks and operational issues are completed overall 
the following table provides a summary of the current status of the five phases involved and a projected timetable for completion 
project phase completed scheduled completion awareness completed evaluation completed hardware implementation january phased software implementation may final validation august overall costs the company has thus far primarily used and expects to continue to primarily use internal financial resources to implement its readiness plan and to upgrade or replace and test systems affected by the year issue 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
in total  the company estimates that its costs  excluding personnel expenses  for year remediation and testing of its computer systems will amount to less than  over the three year period from through not included in this estimate is the cost to replace fully depreciated systems during this period  which occurs in the normal course of business and is not directly attributable to the year issue 
the costs and the timetables in which the company plans to complete the year readiness activities are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party readiness plans and other factors 
the company can make no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from such plans 
risk assessment based upon current information related to the progress of its major vendors and service providers  management has determined that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
this determination is based on the ability of those vendors and service providers to renovate  in a timely manner  the products and services on which the company s systems rely 
however  the company can give no guarantee that the systems of these suppliers will be timely renovated 
contingency plan realizing that some disruption may occur despite its best efforts  the company is in the process of developing contingency plans for each critical system in the event that one or more of those systems fail 
while this is an ongoing process  the company expects to have its plan substantially documented by may because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
new accounting standards in  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed 
the company has not determined the impact on its financial statements of adopting the new accounting standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse change in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for the company  these exposures are primarily related to the sale of product to foreign customers and changes in interest rates 
the company does not have any derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the company s total debt at december  was approximately  market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to a market rate  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
the company s financial position is not materially affected by fluctuations in currencies against the us dollar  since assets held outside the united states are negligible 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchanges rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels of local currency prices  as the preponderance of its foreign sales occur over short periods of time or are demarcated in us dollars
