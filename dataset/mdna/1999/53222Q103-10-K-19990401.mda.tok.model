as of december   the company had an aggregate of  of accounts receivable outstanding in excess of days or approximately of gross receivables  and had inventory of million 
year the company is in the process of investigating issues that could affect its operations regarding year compliance issues 
the year compliance issues revolve around the fact that most computer systems do not recognize a year by its traditional four digit format 
instead  computer systems recognize the last two digits for a specified year 
if not properly addressed  these issues could potentially have an adverse material impact on the company s operations 
the company is in the process of installing new financial accounting systems and a separate new warehouse management system to address the financial and operational needs of its business 
these systems are expected to be fully operational by the end of the first half of and be year compliant 
testing of these systems to determine that they are in fact year compliant has begun and should be fully completed by the end of the second quarter in as results of this testing process become available over the next six months  the company will make contingency plans where it deems necessary 
the company relies on third parties for inventory  supplies  financial products and other key services 
third party entities that could have a potential material impact on the operations of the company s business have been contacted to determine the progress that each has made in connection with year compliance issues 
despite the company s efforts  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies which the company relies on to conduct its day to day business will be compliant 
in such event  the company may  among other things  experience difficulties in obtaining inventory and supplies 
the company will make contingency plans for any entity it feels has not made satisfactory progress towards being year compliant 
contingency plans may include increasing inventory levels  securing alternate supply sources and taking other appropriate measures 
the company is also dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
interruption in our customers operations due to year issues could result in reduced sales and cash flow for the company  and higher inventories 
the company is monitoring the status of its customers to determine potential risks and develop possible alternatives 
although the company believes that the implementation of the new financial accounting and warehouse management systems  along with the evaluation process of significant third party entities  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced  there can be no assurance that failure of the company  third party vendors or customers  to be year compliant could have an adverse material impact on the operations of the company s business 
notwithstanding year issues  the company decided to install the new financial accounting systems and a separate new warehouse management system to accommodate the company s growth 
therefore  at this time  the costs relating to year compliance activities have not been significant and  based on management s best estimates  are not expected to be significant 
however  due to the complexity and pervasiveness of year issues  in particular the uncertainty regarding the compliance programs of third parties  no assurance can be given that costs will not exceed those currently anticipated by the company 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents plus internally generated funds and its credit arrangements will be sufficient to finance its operations for the next months 
the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
the company negotiates its purchase orders with its foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuation in foreign currencies  the company s cost for any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed 
however  the weakening of the united states dollar against local currencies could lead certain manufacturers to increase their united states dollar prices for products 
the company believes it would be able to compensate for any such price increase
