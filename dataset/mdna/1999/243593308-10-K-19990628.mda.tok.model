item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during fiscal  the company completed its transformation from a contract manufacturer operating under an exclusive agreement with rubbermaid as it existed prior to october  to the vertically integrated  international consumer products company it is today 
fiscal was the first year to include a full twelve months of results from hornschuch and  in north america  significant effort and investment was required to build a sales  marketing and product delivery infrastructure following the acquisition of the con tact brand and related product lines in april during the year  management focused on transitioning these new operations and customer relationships from rubbermaid and setting the course for new product expansion and segmentation with emphasis on marketing tailored product offerings to specific market segments and establishing an integrated global marketing strategy 
on april   the company acquired the assets of the decorative products group dcg from rubbermaid for an aggregate cost  including transaction costs  of approximately million the rubbermaid acquisition 
the assets acquired included i the con tact self adhesive line  which is manufactured by decora  ii the shelf liner light adhesive line  which was manufactured by rubbermaid  and iii the grip liner non adhesive covering line  which is currently manufactured by a third party pursuant to the terms of an exclusive manufacturing agreement 
the rubbermaid acquisition has enabled decora  which previously had been primarily only a manufacturer of con tact  to integrate the marketing  sales and distribution of the con tact product offering  as well as the other two product lines  with its manufacturing capabilities 
in conjunction with the financing of the rubbermaid acquisition  the company refinanced a substantial portion of its outstanding debt and made significant investments which were required to integrate the acquired assets into the company s business during a nine month transition period following the acquisition see liquidity and capital resources below 
during this nine month period  decora established a totally new sales  marketing  customer service and distribution management team and operation in its new north american headquarters in north ridgeville  ohio  installed new financial and enterprise resource planning software and hardware systems  established a third party warehousing and distribution service to handle consumer product shipments in north america and relocated acquired manufacturing operations to its fort edward  new york manufacturing facility 
while executing this transformation  the company strove to maintain and strengthen customer relationships and interest in the con tact product line 
in europe  the company s main emphasis was to solidify its management structure  a process which was initiated in late summer and completed by year end 
hornschuch s operations were negatively impacted by a soft economy in germany and by economic crises in russia and the far east 
despite these challenges  hornschuch was able to achieve some offsetting gains in other product segments and to pursue the revitalization of its consumer product offering  laying the groundwork for the potential broadening of its market reach in fiscal while integrating its consumer product plans with the company s global marketing and product strategy 
as a result of the rubbermaid acquisition completed during fiscal and the hornschuch acquisition completed in fiscal  the company has established itself as the worldwide market leader in the self adhesive consumer product market with significant competitive strengths including strong brand recognition  strong product placement with retailers  vertically integrated manufacturing operations  proprietary technologies  broad product lines and cross selling opportunities 
the company s strategy is to utilize these competitive strengths in order to maintain its leadership position and to increase shareholder value

management s focus for north american operations during the year included the establishment of new management and infrastructure for the product lines acquired from rubbermaid 
decora s results were impacted by these factors and also by the nine month transition period during which rubbermaid continued to distribute the acquired product lines and the company operated primarily under product promotion and merchandising programs which were established by rubbermaid prior to the rubbermaid acquisition

selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  for the year ended march  as compared with  or of net sales in the year ended march  the increase of  was a result of the addition of di deutschland s selling  general and administrative expenses for the entire period and an increase at the us operations primarily due to the incremental sales and marketing costs incurred relative to the change from being primarily a contract manufacturer to being a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of con tact products following the rubbermaid acquisition 
interest expense was  for the year ended march  as compared with  in the prior year 
the increase of  is principally due to interest expense of approximately  on the  senior secured notes which were issued by the company on april  in connection with the rubbermaid acquisition the notes  partially offset by interest income earned on cash deposits and lower interest expense on other debt due to lower average borrowings in the current year 
the company recognized income before income taxes  minority interest in earnings of subsidiary and extraordinary item of  in the year ended march   as compared with income of  in the year ended march  this increase is principally a result of the increase in earnings resulting from the rubbermaid acquisition and the hornschuch acquisition  partially offset by higher interest expense on the notes

the decrease in gross profit in the united states was principally due to the decreased net sales discussed above 
gross profit margin increased by percentage points primarily because of the higher gross profit margin contributed by di deutschland s operations in the year ended march  di deutschland s higher gross profit margin reflects its different product mix and its greater degree of vertical integration than the us operations 
di deutschland s gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by changes in product mix in the fourth quarter due to increased sales of more profitable decorative products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  for the year ended march  as compared with  or of net sales  in the year ended march  the increase of  was a result of the addition of di deutschland s selling  general and administrative expenses of  reflected in the year ended march   offset by a decrease of  at the us operations

certain indirect subsidiaries of hornschuch own two commercial real estate properties in germany which are unrelated to its operating business and which collateralize debt totaling approximately  currently  the properties are producing rental income sufficient to cover interest payments 
management is attempting to sell the properties  however  there is no assurance that the properties can be sold in the near term  or at all  at a price which will be sufficient to repay the loans in full

additionally the company intends to expand sales in complementary industrial product areas and to renew sales efforts in recovering developing countries 
as a result of the financing associated with the rubbermaid and hornschuch acquisitions  the company has substantial debt in relation to its shareholders equity  as well as substantial debt service requirements that are significant compared to its cash flow from operations 
as of march   the company had consolidated outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  which represented of total capitalization 
the company s ability to service its debt will depend upon the company s future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control and by restrictive debt covenants 
if the company is unable to service its indebtedness  it may be required to alter its business plans  restructure or refinance its indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to accomplish these objectives on terms acceptable to it  if at all 
the company s foreign operations are conducted primarily through hornschuch 
the company s european operations  representing approximately of the company s net sales for the fiscal year ended march   are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including governmental instability  war and other international conflicts  civil and labor disturbances  requirements of local ownership  minority interests  partial or total expropriation  nationalization  currency devaluation  foreign exchange controls and foreign laws and policies  each of which may limit the movement of assets or funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
year risks many existing computer systems  communication systems  machines and other items  whether large or small  which utilize microprocessors and or software use only two digits rather than four digits to process date related transactions 
as a result  many of these items will not be able to correctly process a transaction with the year date  as the could cause the program or system to fail or create erroneous results before  on or after january  the year issue 
the company has employees in both its north american and european operations who have the task of identifying potential year issues and overseeing the implementation of solutions with respect to these issues where possible 
with regard to the company s primary computer systems  the company s european operating subsidiary licenses and utilizes a comprehensive management information system which was installed in  includes general ledger  accounts receivable  accounts payable and manufacturing control and is currently year compliant 
the company s north american operations recently completed phases i ii of a program to replace its primary management information and communication systems with full year compliance 
this included hardware and software required to operate its telephone systems  its accounting systems including general ledger  accounts receivable  accounts payable and manufacturing control systems at a cost of approximately  in addition to its primary management information system  the company utilizes personal computers  which function either on a stand alone basis or as workstations on an integrated network 
these computers utilize a variety of operating systems and software packages ranging from windows nt to dos platforms 
the company is completing its survey to detect non compliant systems and believes that the majority of these systems can and will be made year compliant prior to january  at little or no cost to the company through software updates provided by the respective software vendors 
any full system replacements which may be required are not anticipated to have a material impact on the cash flow of the company and can be funded from operating cash flow 
the company has completed the process of reviewing other equipment and systems in order to determine and remedy any potential year issues 
certain manufacturing equipment has date sensitive controllers which are not year compliant and will have to be upgraded  replaced or decommissioned 
the company is on target to resolve these issues by september at a cost which is anticipated to be within ordinary maintenance expenditure levels 
the company does not separately track the incremental costs incurred for the investigation  analysis and remedy of year issues 
such costs consist principally of related payroll costs of certain members of its systems and operations groups 
the company sells its products primarily to retailers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers with a significant number of such transactions occurring electronically 
the company also purchases raw materials from many vendors  however  the majority of such purchasing transactions are not handled electronically 
if the company  or any third party with whom the company does business  were to have a year problem  the company s business could be seriously disrupted which could negatively affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this is particularly true in the case of retail customers where high volume transactions would have to be converted to a manual system until any year issue was resolved 
the company has completed the process of reviewing the year compliance status with its vendors and customers and to date is not aware of a situation which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and or financial condition  although no assurances can be given that such a problem does not exist  or will not exist in the future 
as the company continues to evaluate the year compliance status of its suppliers and vendors  it will also develop contingency plans to deal with any potential problems that may arise in this analysis

in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements

impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the intended use of the derivative and its designation as either a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation a foreign currency hedge  will determine when the gains or losses on the derivatives are to be reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the new standard must be adopted for fiscal year financial reporting and the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates the company s exposure to market risk from interest rate changes relates primarily to variable rate bank lines of credit 
as of march   the company had cash flow exposure on its bank lines of credit in germany approximately dm million or million due to its variable libor pricing and on its tax exempt industrial revenue bonds  in the united states which bear interest at a variable rate 
accordingly  as of march  a basis point increase in the libor and a basis point increase in the bond s floating rate increase would have an immaterial effect on the company s pre tax earnings 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk to the extent of adverse fluctuations in foreign currencies 
for the fiscal year ended march   approximately of the company s net sales were in currencies other than us dollars  primarily german marks 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts periodically to hedge currency fluctuation relative to future fixed payments 
such hedging activities are not significant in total 
a change in the value of all foreign currencies would have resulted in a change of approximately  in pre tax earnings for the fiscal year ended march  interest rate swaps and caps hornschuch has four interest rate cap agreements as of march  for dm million  dm million  dm million and dm million which are used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates for existing debt balances 
hornschuch is also party to three interest swap agreements as of march  for dm million  dm million and dm million 
these agreements are used to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
for the dm million instrument  the related debt had been repaid early 
however  hornschuch was obliged to maintain the swap and pay receive the difference between hornschuch s fixed rate and the original variable rate 
decora has one interest rate swap agreement as of march  with its primary lender which expires in may the agreement effectively converted  of its variable rate borrowings into fixed rate obligations 
while the underlying obligations have been repaid  decora continues to make payments under the agreement until expiration in may at march   the fair value of the company s interest rate caps and interest rate swaps approximate carrying value
