the company did not declare any dividends during fiscal year but did declare dividends of 
per share during fiscal year and 
per share during fiscal year year issues the year issue is a result of certain microprocessors and computer programs that were designed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather that the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions to operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar activities 
the company is continually working to resolve the potential risks and concerns of the year issues 
the company has made progress in assessing and implementing systems to be year ready completing the conversion of its major business computer systems to be year ready on january  at its us facility and on july  at its honduran facility 
none of the company s products are year sensitive  so the total cost of the year project has been minimal so far at approximately  the company expensed all costs associated with these system changes as the costs were incurred  and they were funded through operating cash flows 
since the company s major computer systems are already year compliant  the company does not foresee the need of a contingency plan for those minor systems that are not significant enough to disrupt the company s business 
the company is also assessing the readiness of its significant suppliers  which if not year ready  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that if certain suppliers were not year ready  then alternate arrangements could be made to alleviate any material impact on operations 
achieving year compliance is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to identify all aspects of its business that are subject to year problems  specifically those related to suppliers that could have a material effect on the company 
as a contingency plan  the company will maintain sufficient inventory of those parts with long lead times that are critical to the manufacturing process
