the company anticipates that its primary uses of working capital in the near term will be the expansion of secs  the development of new facilities and funding growth through acquisitions and otherwise  and the accounts receivable related thereto 
the cash generated from working capital may not be adequate to fund such uses and accordingly  the company may in the future be required to seek additional sources of financing  including borrowing and or sale of equity securities resulting in further dilution to shareholders 
no assurance can be given that any such additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms 
the company opened a third sec in chennai  india during the first quarter of the indian sec affords the company access to highly skilled  cost effective engineers and programmers year disclosure the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations 
causing disruptions of operation  including among other things a temporary inability to process transactions  send incorrect invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s internal computer information systems are substantially year compliant 
prt group implemented new application systems effective during  to satisfy all finance  accounting  human resources  sales and recruiting requirements 
all internal computer hardware  operating systems  utilities and tools have been tested and made compliant 
accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that internal systems failures will result in any material adverse effect to its operations or financial condition

litigation the company  certain of its officers and directors and certain allegedly controlling shareholders of the company have been named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  captioned steinberg v 
prt group inc  douglas k 
mellinger  lowell r 
robinson  gregory s 
mellinger and the mellinger group  civ the complaint purports to be brought on behalf of all shareholders who purchased the company s common stock from november  through march  the complaint asserts that defendants violated sections  a and or of the securities act of by purportedly misrepresenting and or omitting material information concerning prt s business and operations in the registration statement and prospectus issued in connection with prt s initial public offering on or about november  the lawsuit seeks unquantified compensatory damages  pre and post judgment interest  attorneys fees  expert witness fees and other costs  rescission  equitable relief and such other and further relief as the court may find proper 
the company has retained counsel for itself and the named officers and directors 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit 
in the normal course of business  various claims may be made against the company 
at this time  in the opinion of management  there are no pending claims  aside from the above mentioned shareholder suit  the outcome of which are expected to result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
factors that may affect future results recruitment and retention of it professionals the company s business is labor intensive 
the company s success depends upon its ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain it consultants and it sales professionals who possess the necessary technical skills and experience or can be trained to deliver the company s services 
qualified it consultants and it sales professionals are in high demand worldwide and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that prt will continue to have access to qualified it and it sales professionals  will be successful in retaining current or future it professionals  or that the cost of employing and subcontracting such it professionals will not increase due to shortages 
failure to attract or retain qualified it professionals in sufficient numbers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
increasing significance of and risks associated with international operations the company will increase its investment in international operations over the next several years with an increasing percentage of its revenues generated by operations in countries outside of the united states 
during the years ended december   and  the percentage of revenue generated outside the united states was  and  respectively 
there were no revenues generated outside the united states prior to the company s international operations depend greatly upon business  immigration and technology transfer laws in those countries and upon the continued development of the local technology infrastructure 
as a result  the company s business is subject to the risks generally associated with non united states operations including  among other things i unexpected changes in regulatory environments  ii difficulties in managing international operations  iii potential adverse foreign tax consequences  including impact upon repatriation of earnings  iv tariffs and other trade barriers and v political unrest and changing conditions in countries in which the company s services are provided or facilities are located 
in addition  although nearly all of the company s foreign sales are payable in us dollars  there can be no assurance that of the company s future contracts will be payable in us dollars  to the extent that the company s future contracts are payable in foreign currencies  the company could be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
although the company does not engage in currency hedging transactions  to date the company has not sustained any foreign currency losses 
if any of the above factors were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
prt has operated its barbados sec for approximately three years 
prt believes barbados is one of the most stable countries in the caribbean  has a long tradition of democracy and that the company currently has good relations with the government of barbados 
while prt barbados ltd 
prt barbados is an international business company under barbadian law  prt has negotiated special incentives with the barbadian government including  among other things  certain advantageous tax rates  an exclusivity and non compete agreement which expires in and the ability to secure an unlimited number of employee work permits and visas 
there is no guarantee that this relationship will continue or that these special incentives will not be curbed or eliminated 
while the company believes that the expiration of the non compete agreement will not have a material adverse effect on prt s business  operating results or financial condition  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
if the barbadian government were to take any such action in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
a significant element of the company s business strategy is to continue to open and develop secs  sales and account management offices and training and recruiting centers 
prt currently has a recruiting center in mumbai  india and an sec in chennai  india 
the indian government exerts significant influence over its economy 
in the recent past  the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in certain sectors of the economy  including the it industry 
certain of these benefits that could directly affect the company include  among others i tax holidays  ii liberalized import and export duties and iii preferential rules with respect to foreign investment and repatriation of earnings 
changes in the business  political or regulatory climate of india could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  although wage costs in india are significantly lower than in the united states and elsewhere for comparably skilled it professionals  wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states 
in the past  india has experienced significant inflation and shortages of foreign exchange  and has been subject to political unrest 
changes in inflation  interest rates  taxation or other social  political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
limited operating history  losses the company has a limited operating history and has incurred losses from the year ended december  until the year ended december in order to operate profitably in the future  the company must accomplish some of the following objectives i increase the amount of services rendered to existing clients and develop new clients  ii develop and realize additional revenue sources and iii reduce costs of providing services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in meeting these objectives or that the company will be able to sustain profitability 
fluctuations in operating results the company s revenues and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to i the timing and number of client projects commenced or delayed by the client and completed during the quarter  ii the number of working days in a quarter and iii employee hiring  attrition and utilization rates 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses  in particular personnel and facilities costs  is relatively fixed  variations in revenues may cause significant variations in operating results 
additionally  the company periodically incurs cost increases due to both the hiring of new employees and strategic investments in its infrastructure in anticipation of future projects and opportunities for revenue growth 
quarterly results are likely to fluctuate  which may cause a material adverse effect on the market price of prt s common stock 
ability to sustain and manage growth the company s business has grown rapidly during the past several years due to the increased demand for its services from existing clients  the addition of new clients and the increased number of company sales and account management offices and secs 
the company s continued growth is dependent upon a number of factors  including  but not limited to i the continued growth of the barbados and hartford area secs  ii the ability to continue to replicate secs in the future  iii the ability to cultivate additional business from existing clients  iv the ability to obtain new clients  v the ability to locate and hire it professionals within new and existing markets  vi the continued identification and training of corporate personnel to staff new and recently opened or acquired sales and account management offices and secs  vii the successful performance of recently opened or acquired offices  viii the ability to anticipate  acquire  master and exploit new technologies as they develop  ix the ability to anticipate the ramp up rate of client projects and x the ability to manage expenses in anticipation of expected project revenue ramp up 
there can be no assurance that recently opened or acquired offices will achieve and sustain any level of profitability or that the company s historical revenue growth will continue 
further  the company s rapid growth and expansion has placed and could continue to place a significant strain on the company s management  personnel and resources 
the company s ability to continue to manage its growth successfully will require it to further enhance its management  financial and information systems and controls 
finally  the company s management has no demonstrated experience in managing the company during times of economic downturn  and there can be no assurance that management can maintain profitability or growth levels at such times 
the failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
concentration of revenues in fiscal year  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from five clients with one client  prudential insurance company of america  accounting for approximately of the company s revenues in and of revenues in during fiscal year  approximately of the company s revenues was derived from its largest five clients 
jp morgan accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in and of the company s revenues in most of prt s larger clients are comprised of a number of subsidiaries or divisions  each of which prt considers to be a separate client because they make their own purchasing decisions 
the loss of a significant client could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain stockholders of the company are significant prt clients 
although the company has no reason to expect it  a client stockholder could be less inclined to maintain the same volume of business with the company in the future if such client stockholder were to sell most or all of its shares of prt common stock 
potential liability to clients many of the company s engagements  including year projects  involve services that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
although the company attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from errors  mistakes  omissions or negligent acts in rendering its services  there can be no assurance that its attempts to limit liability will be successful 
the company s failure or inability to meet a client s expectations in the performance of its services could result in a material adverse effect on the client s operations and  therefore  could give rise to claims against the company or damage the company s reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
reliance on key personnel the company s future success depends on the continued services of certain key management personnel  in particular  douglas k 
mellinger  chief executive officer  and srinivasan viswanathan  president of the solutions business and prt barbados  each of whom has entered into an employment agreement with prt 
while the company retains a key man life insurance policy in the amount of million on mr 
mellinger  there can be no assurance that such amount would adequately compensate the company for a loss of his services 
in addition  the company s continued growth depends on its ability to attract and retain capable management personnel 
failure to do so or the loss of either of messrs 
mellinger or viswanathan could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
potential decreases in demand for year services in year revenues were below of the company s total revenues 
after the year  the company believes that demand for year solutions will continue  however  such demand is expected to begin to diminish as many year solutions are implemented and tested 
contract risk most of the company s contracts are terminable by the client following limited notice and without significant penalty 
in addition  each stage of a project often represents a separate contractual commitment at the end of which the client may elect to delay or not to proceed to the next stage of the project 
while  to date  none of the company s clients has terminated a material contract or materially reduced the scope of a large project  there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s clients will not take such actions in the future 
in the first quarter of  the company experienced a decrease in revenues from its solutions business performed in barbados 
as a result of this decrease in the barbados sec revenue  the company expects to report a net loss for the first quarter of the delay  cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of a large project or number of projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
fixed price engagements the company principally bills for its services on a time and materials or line of code basis  however  some of the company s contracts contain a cap on the amount of fees the company can charge 
the company occasionally has entered into fixed price billing engagements and may in the future enter into additional engagements billed on a fixed price basis 
while the company s business  operating results and financial condition have not been materially adversely affected by any failure of the company to complete a fixed price engagement within budget in the past and the company does not anticipate any such failure in the future  any such failure could expose the company to risks associated with cost overruns  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks of technological change and evolving industry standards the it services industry is characterized by rapid technological change  shifting client preferences and new product developments 
the introduction of competitive it solutions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render the company s existing it solutions  skills base or underlying technologies obsolete or unmarketable 
as a result  the company will be dependent in large part upon its ability to develop new it solutions and capabilities that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its clients and keep pace with new competitive service and product offerings and emerging industry standards to achieve broad market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that i the company will be successful in developing and marketing new it solutions that respond to technological changes  shifting client requirements or evolving industry standards  ii that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new it solutions or iii its it solutions will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
any failure to respond to technological change or evolving industry standards could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition the company experiences intense competition 
the market for services such as those prt offers is very broad and such services are offered by a large number of private and public companies  many of which are significantly larger than  and have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than  prt 
additionally  in certain sectors of the company s business  particularly professional services  there are few barriers to entry and new competitors do and are expected to enter the market 
as competitors enter the market to provide services similar to the company  prt s ability to compete effectively will increasingly depend upon the quality and price of its services 
competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks related to possible acquisitions the company has expanded and expects to continue to expand its operations through the acquisition of additional businesses 
see business certain acquisition transactions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired businesses into the company without substantial expenses  delays or other operational or financial difficulty 
furthermore  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including  but not limited to i diversion of management s attention  ii possible failure to retain key acquired personnel  iii unanticipated events or circumstances  iv risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience or v legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
client satisfaction or performance problems at a single acquired business could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of the company as a whole 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquired businesses will achieve anticipated financial performance 
while the company from time to time considers acquisition opportunities  it has no existing binding agreements  understandings or commitments to effect any material acquisition 
the failure of the company to manage its acquisition strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
united states government regulation of immigration the company recruits employees from around the world 
some of these employees work in the united states under h b temporary work permits 
as of december   approximately of prt s worldwide workforce was working under h b temporary work permits in the united states 
although  to date  prt has not experienced difficulties in obtaining sufficient h b work permits  in the future the company may be unable to obtain h b work permits to bring necessary employees to the united states for any number of reasons including  without limitation  limits set by the united states immigration and naturalization service 
continued compliance with existing united states or foreign immigration laws  or changes in such laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting the ability of the company to retain h b employees in the united states or employees working under work permits in other countries  could increase the company s cost of recruiting and retaining the requisite number of it professionals which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights in order to protect its proprietary rights in its various intellectual properties  the company currently relies on copyrights  trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know how which may be duplicated by others 
the company employs various methods  including nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with employees and suppliers and technical protective measures to protect its proprietary know how 
as a signatory to the berne convention  an international treaty  the government of barbados has agreed to recognize protections on copyrighted materials conferred under the laws of foreign countries  including the laws of the united states 
the company believes that laws  rules  regulations and treaties in effect in the united states and barbados are adequate to protect it from misappropriation or unauthorized use of its intellectual property 
however  there can be no assurance that such laws will not change and  in particular  that the laws of barbados will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components  libraries and toolsets from barbados to the united states 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its intellectual property  or that the company will be able to deter unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its rights 
in addition  the failure of such protective measures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that other persons will not independently develop such know how or obtain access to it  or independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to prt s technology 
the company presently holds no patents or registered copyrights 
a competitor of the company recently announced the filing with the united states patent and trademark office of three patent applications relating to year processes 
the company does not know the proprietary features of the processes covered by such patent applications since united states patent applications are not publicly available until the patents  if any  are issued 
although the company believes that its intellectual property rights  including intellectual property rights licensed from third parties by the company  do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that i such a claim will not be asserted against the company in the future  ii assertion of such claims will not result in litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable terms or iii any of prt s software could be redesigned on an economical basis or at all  or that any such redesigned software would be competitive with the software of the company s competitors 
the company expects that the risk of infringement claims against the company will increase if more of prt s competitors are able to successfully obtain patents for software products and processes 
any such claims  regardless of their outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain anti takeover effects the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include provisions under which only the board of directors  the chairman of the board or the president may call meetings of stockholders and certain advance notice procedures for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors 
directors of the company are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 
the board of directors of the company is empowered to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of such shares without any further stockholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  this blank check preferred stock  and any issuance thereof  may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
control by principal stockholders as of march   the mellinger family owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock and effectively controlled the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the company s stockholders  including extraordinary transactions such as mergers  sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets or going private transactions 
such control may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices 
possible volatility of stock price the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  factors such as announcements of acquisitions of businesses  technological innovations  new products or services or new client engagements by the company or its competitors or third parties  as well as market conditions in the it services industry or the flow of company business  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
shares eligible for future sale  registration rights as of december   the company had an aggregate of  shares of common stock and non voting common stock outstanding   of which were freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  as amended the securities act  except those shares  if any  owned or acquired by affiliates of the company 
the remaining  shares in the aggregate of common stock and non voting common stock outstanding are restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act 
the company and certain of the company s stockholders have agreed not to offer  sell  contract to sell or otherwise dispose of  directly or indirectly  any shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into or furthermore  on january  the company filed a registration statement on form s registering  shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to stock options granted  or to be granted  under the company s amended and restated stock option plan
