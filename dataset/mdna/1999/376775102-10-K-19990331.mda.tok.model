overview the company s vision continues to focus on being a quality  cost effective producer 
the challenge of stagnant gold markets with prices averaging under per ounce in continues to be a concern to the company 
cost containment programs continue at all locations 
our mandate is to maximize shareholder value by increasing reserves  implementing economies of scale and operating effectively and conscientiously at all facilities 
to that end  we have actively sought out growth opportunities 
on october  the company completed the acquisition of mar west 
this acquisition brought the company an impressive portfolio of late stage development properties in central america 
financial data for mar west is included in the company s financial statements refer to note of the financial statements 
adding more immediate production was the objective of the acquisition in early  of rayrock 
this addition brings the company three operating mines generating over  ounces of gold per year 
because the rayrock acquisition is a subsequent event  financial data for rayrock is not included in the financial statements refer to note of the financial statements 
the acquisitions of these two companies have substantially increased the company s assets  and has established it as a well funded  intermediate gold producer with production in excess of  ounces of gold per year 
results of operations for the years ended december    and summary the company substantially improved its performance during although the company incurred a net loss of million per share in  this compares favorably to a loss of million per share in the company reported a profit of million per share in the results reflect continuing lower average market prices for gold in  in  and in  as well as decreased production as the picacho mine winds down 
net cash flows provided by operations continue to be positive million in and the company s working capital is a strong million 
the company plans approximately million in capital expenditures and exploration costs in  all from internally generated funds 
gold production on a consolidated basis gold production for the year ended december  was  ounces  a decrease of  ounces or fewer ounces than were produced in the year ended december  the production of  was an increase of over the production reported for the fiscal year ended december  of  ounces 
the production for the year ended december  compares favorably to the projection made in last year s report anticipating production of  to  ounces of gold for fiscal the company expects that gold production for the year ended december  will exceed  ounces 
production from the imperial project is not included in the projections since production from this project will depend upon a conclusion to the permitting process and improved project economics 
rand mine the rand mine produced  ounces of gold in the year ended december  which was less than the  ounces of gold in the year ended december  production was  ounces of gold during the year ended december  the decrease in production at the rand mine in the current year was the result of the year end mine plan revision in response to lower gold prices 
in order to reduce costs  the rand mine eliminated reserves from the proven and probable categories which were not economically feasible to mine at then existing gold prices 
picacho mine the picacho mine produced  ounces of gold during the year ended december  which was lower than the  ounces of gold produced during the year ended december   but almost  ounces more than forecast 
the production decreased marginally over the rate of  ounces of gold 
mining of the last known ore body at the picacho mine was completed in january  on target with life of mine projections 
gold production continued during and will continue with an anticipated production of  ounces in followed by reclamation of the last remaining heap leach pad and processing facility 
reclamation is expected to be completed by the year  with continued revegetation monitoring thereafter 
cieneguita project in july  the company completed the purchase of its joint venture partner s share of cieneguita 
total ounces credited to the company in were  compared to  ounces in the company expects production to approach  ounces during refer to note c of the financial statements 
revenue revenue from production for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for average revenue realized per ounce of gold dropped to in from in the average realized price per ounce for gold in was the decline in gold prices accounted for million of the million decrease in revenues from to the remaining million of the decrease resulted from reduced production 
revenue decreased million due to the changes in the price of gold from to the increase in production for the year ended december  increased revenue realized during by million over the year ended cost of production the cash cost of production includes mining  processing and direct mine overhead costs while royalties  selling  general and administrative costs and depreciation and depletion costs are excluded 
the company s cash cost of production for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of over the million incurred for the year ended december  the reduced costs reflect the cessation of mining at the picacho mine in january of and the reduction in operating shifts at the rand mine as a result of lower gold prices 
cash costs of production of million for the year ended december  were greater than the million incurred for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase in costs resulted from increased production of  ounces of gold 
an additional million was written off the carrying value of work in process inventories at the picacho and rand mines resulting from re valuing the ounces of gold on the heap leach pads to net realizable value 
the average cash cost per ounce of gold production decreased to per ounce during from a rate of per ounce 
this was due to the cessation of mining at picacho  resulting in reduced labor and operating costs  as well cost reductions at the rand mine 
the average cash cost per ounce of gold production in was per ounce 
the increase between and was due primarily to the inventory cost adjustments 
other income and expenses depreciation and depletion charges for the year ended december  were million 
this represents a million decrease from the million charge incurred in the year ended december  the reduction is a result of the decrease in production and the corresponding reduction in depreciation and depletion charged on a unit of production basis 
the cutbacks in staffing generated fewer hours of machine operation and  consequently  a reduction in depreciation based on machine hours of operation 
for the year ended december   depreciation and depletion charges were million compared to the million incurred for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to the increase in gold production during using the same unit of production basis 
royalty expense of million for the year ended december  was million less than the million incurred during the lower royalty expense was a result of a lower gold prices  fewer ounces produced and a higher proportion of the production coming from the rand mine  which has a lower royalty rate 
during  royalty expense was million 
exploration costs in the year ended december  totaled  compared to the million expensed during and million in the company significantly reduced exploration activity during due to the decision to seek out growth opportunities through acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  were lower than the million and million incurred during and respectively 
the reduction was due to restructuring activities that took place in the first quarter of  which included closing of the vancouver office and transferring the administrative and financial functions to the reno office 
restructuring charges of million were incurred in relating to these changes 
during a loss of million was incurred from the sales or write downs of the company s investments in various junior exploration companies 
this compares to the million written off in on the company s investment in two junior exploration companies as well as a million write down on the cieneguita project 
there were no write downs during the year ended december  interest and other income for and totaled million and million  respectively  comprised primarily of investment income on the company s cash balances 
million income for the year ended december  includes a gain of approximately million from the sale of the investment in aquiline resources 
interest expense and amortization of financing costs for the year ended december  was  compared to the december  expense of  interest expense and amortization of financing costs under such facilities totaled  in the reduction in both years was primarily due to the termination of a credit facility in liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow the company had working capital of million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  the long term liabilities consisting of reserves for reclamation and deferred taxes totaled approximately million at december   million at december  and million at december  during cash flow from operations totaled million compared to million for the year  and million in the decrease in cash flow is primarily attributable to the decrease in the realized price per ounce of gold as well as fewer ounces of gold being produced

in the course of business the company may issue debt or equity securities to meet the growth plans of the company if it determines that additional resources could be obtained under favorable financial market conditions 
no assurance can be given that additional funding will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to the company 
hedging during the third quarter of  the company implemented a limited policy to hedge future gold production 
this policy was amended in february to allow hedging of of the company s planned production for up to five years 
as at december   the company had outstanding call options on  ounces of gold expiring january  as well as forward sales of  ounces of gold for delivery in january this compares to a position of put options for  ounces of gold at per ounce expiring through april refer to item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
environmental  regulatory and other risk factors reclamation the company generally is required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  reshaping and revegetating various portions of a site once mining and processing are completed 
reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans which have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
whenever feasible  reclamation is conducted concurrently with mining 
during the past three years  reclamation expenditures have not been material 
standard open pit leaching techniques have been established to meet reclamation requirements imposed by regulatory authorities 
due to the impervious qualities of the heap leach pad and the closed nature of the leaching system  the company believes that its mining operations have a relatively modest effect on the environment 
though the company believes that its mining operations are in compliance with all present health  safety and environmental rules and regulations there is always some uncertainty associated with such due to the complexity and application of such rules and regulations 
the company does not anticipate that the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material impact on its earnings in the foreseeable future 
however  possible future health  safety and environmental legislation  regulations and actions could cause additional expense  capital expenditures  restrictions and delays in the activities of the company  the extent of which cannot be predicted 
during the years ended december    and  there were no material expenditures for environmental control facilities other than for design of monitoring systems at the rand mine 
the company estimates that it will make no material capital expenditures in this area during the year ending december   other than monitoring systems incorporated into leach pad construction and expansion programs 
at the corporate level  an environmental compliance committee and policy statement have been established to assure measurable standards for internal environmental audits for review by the board of directors 
the committee has been active and is satisfied the company is complying with regulatory parameters 
as of december   the company had in place million of letters of credit issued as security for future reclamation costs 
the company also has an arrangement with a bonding company which has replaced letters of credit in the amount of million with bonds issued as security for future reclamation costs 
regulatory legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of the us congress to make significant revisions to the general mining law of which would affect the company s unpatented mining claims on federal lands  including a royalty on gold production 
any levy of the type proposed in the past would only apply to unpatented federal lands and accordingly would have an insignificant effect on the economics of the rand mine s production from the yellow aster pit 
it cannot be predicted if these proposals will become law 
however  should a royalty become law  it will affect the profitability of rand s production from the baltic and lamont pits  the imperial project  and the newly acquired rayrock mines 
a net profits royalty of to the us government  which may or may not be an adequate allowance  was included in the final feasibility study for the imperial project and is included in the estimated total cost of production 
other risk factors the company s mineral development and mining activities and profitability involve significant risks due to numerous factors outside of its control including  but not limited to the price of gold  changes in the regulatory environment  various foreign exchange fluctuations  and risks inherent in mining 
a major external factor that has a marked effect on liquidity  either positive or negative  is the price of gold bullion on international markets 
the company s break even price per ounce of gold includes all costs  including depreciation and depletion  royalties  corporate administration and exploration but excludes inventory and investment write downs and one time costs associated with the corporate restructuring 
for the year ended december  the company s break even price was  compared to for  and for  including depreciation and depletion of per ounce of gold for the year ending december   per ounce in  and per ounce in any sustained changes in the price of gold over or under these levels will appreciably affect the company s general liquidity position  and could substantially increase or decrease revenues  earnings and cash flow 
other matters the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits rather than four to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or some other date resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
in addition similar problems may arise in some systems which use certain dates in to represent something other than a date 
the effects of the year issue may be experienced before  on  or after january   and if not addressed  the impact on operations and financial reporting may range from minor errors to significant systems failure  which could affect an entity s ability to conduct normal business operations 
it is not possible to be certain that all aspects of the year issue affecting the entity  including those related to the efforts of customers  suppliers  or other third parties  will be fully resolved 
the company believes that its recordkeeping and reporting systems are already compliant 
the company has state of the art systems using relational technology already in place 
all network servers have been certified compliant by their manufacturer 
the company has planned additional software upgrades which will underscore the readiness of the system 
due to the nature of the company s business  there are few interconnects and interdependencies to consider 
the critical major equipment suppliers have been contacted and have already indicated their compliance or are keeping the company informed of their progress 
contingency planning is ongoing and consists of continuing contact with major suppliers not yet certifying compliance regarding correction or mitigation efforts 
the company expects total in house compliance and completion of supplier assessment by early third quarter there have been limited specific year costs incurred by the company 
hardware and software upgrades were planned based on business requirements 
additional expenditures prior to year end are not expected to exceed  the nature of the company s mining business is not high tech and consequently not significantly dependent on computer hardware or software outside the financial reporting systems  which have already been addressed 
the company expects no material change in revenues due to year issues 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as noted in item other risks the company is subject to changes in metals prices which directly impact its profitability and cash flows 
because the markets in which the company sells its products set prices outside of the company s control  the company believes it is important to reduce the impact of negative price movements through hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions utilize so called derivatives  the value of which is derived from movements in the prices or rates associated with the underlying product 
the company s hedging policy was established to protect the company s production by use of forward contracts  spot deferred contracts  and options  in any combination 
the company continuously monitors its position with respect to the unrealized gains and losses and to ensure compliance with company policy 
the company also invests cash balances in short term investments which are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
because these investments are in highly liquid  short term instruments  any impact of an interest rate change will not be material 
the table below sets forth the positions of the company at december  in millions of u 
s dollars maturity fair value at assets short term investments derivatives gold forward sales ounces  price per ounce gold call options sold ounces  nil price per ounce
