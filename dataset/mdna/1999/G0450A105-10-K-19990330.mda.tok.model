item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company rchi is the holding company for risk capital reinsurance  its wholly owned subsidiary which is domiciled in nebraska 
rchi was incorporated in march and commenced operations during september upon completion of the offerings 
rchi received aggregate net proceeds from the offerings of approximately million  of which million was contributed to the capital of risk capital reinsurance 
on november   risk capital reinsurance was licensed under the insurance laws of the state of nebraska 
as of december   the statutory surplus of risk capital reinsurance was approximately million 
in july  risk capital reinsurance capitalized its wholly owned subsidiary  cross river insurance company cross river  with million 
cross river received its nebraska insurance license in october  and intends to seek authorization to operate in most other states as an excess and surplus lines insurer 
recent industry performance demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers and prevailing general economic and market conditions  all of which affect liability retention decisions of primary insurers and reinsurance premium rates 
the supply of reinsurance is directly related to prevailing prices and levels of surplus capacity  which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the reinsurance industry 
the year was a difficult period from both a market and earnings perspective for most insurance markets 
the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance segments have experienced an increasingly more difficult and highly competitive operating environment characterized by a soft rate structure and overcapitalization 
other factors that have contributed to the prevailing competitive conditions in the reinsurance industry in recent years include new entrants to the reinsurance market including certain specialized reinsurance operations and the presence of certain reinsurance companies which operate within tax advantaged jurisdictions eg  bermuda  cayman islands that benefit from higher after tax investment returns 
in addition  concerns with respect to the financial security of lloyd s that had adversely impacted the competitive position of that marketplace have apparently been overcome by actions taken at lloyd s over the last few years  thereby enhancing its competitive position 
the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including changes in the propensity of courts to grant larger awards  natural disasters such as catastrophic hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods and fires  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and the income and returns on investments  and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by ceding primary insurers 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive and dynamic  and market changes may affect  among other things  demand for the company s products  changes in investment opportunities and the performance thereof  changes in the products offered by the company or changes in the company s business strategy 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
reinsurance treaties that are placed by intermediaries are typically for one year terms with a substantial number that are written or renewed on january each year 
other significant renewal dates include april  july and october the january  renewal period was marked by continuing intensified competitive conditions in terms of premium rates and treaty terms and conditions in both the property and casualty segments of the marketplace 
these conditions have been worsened due to large domestic primary companies retaining more of their business and ceding less premiums to reinsurers 
while the company is initially somewhat disadvantaged compared to many of its competitors  which are larger  have greater resources and longer operating histories than the company  it believes it has been able to generate attractive opportunities in the marketplace due to its substantial unencumbered capital base  experienced management team  relationship with its equity investment advisor and strategic focus on generating a small number of large reinsurance treaty transactions that may also be integrated with an equity investment in client companies 
commencing in late  in addition to its core business  the company expanded into specialty classes of reinsurance business  including marine and aviation and space in  surety and fidelity in  and accident and health in in force business at january   the company had approximately renewable reinsurance treaties that are in force  with approximately million of estimated annualized net premiums written  compared to million at january   representing an increase of 
such in force premiums at january  represent estimated annualized premiums from treaties entered into during and the january  renewal period that are expected to generate net premiums written during such renewable treaties at january  are estimated to generate approximately million of net premiums written over the month period ending december  without taking into account certain factors  including the possibility that i several treaties entered into in that are scheduled to expire during the remainder of may be renewed and ii additional treaties may be bound during results of operations the company had consolidated comprehensive loss of million for the year ended december  and consolidated comprehensive income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
comprehensive income for the company is composed of net income and the change in unrealized appreciation of investments

approximately  and of net premiums written in  and  respectively  were generated from companies in which the company has invested or committed to invest funds 
approximately  and of net premiums written in  and  respectively  were from non united states clients  which are lloyd s syndicates or are located in the united kingdom  bermuda and continental europe 
consistent with the company s strategy of writing a small number of large treaties for its core business  three clients contributed approximately million  or  of the company s total net premiums written  with the largest client contributing approximately and the remaining two contributing and  respectively 
the business written from the client that contributed is part of an integrated transaction  and such business is subject to renewal at the company s option for five years 
in  five clients contributed approximately million  or  of the company s total net premiums written  with the largest client contributing approximately and the remaining four contributing from to 
while not anticipated  the reduction or loss of business assumed from one or more large clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations to the extent not offset by new business 
the company s ceded premiums increased to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the company s expansion in into marine and aviation and space reinsurance business  for which the company seeks to reduce its exposure to large and catastrophic losses 
see results of operations risk retention and business retrocessional arrangements 
approximately million  or  of net premiums written in resulted from unearned premium portfolios and other non recurring transactions 
this amount included million of specialty premiums written from contracts pursuant to which the company reinsures a portion of one underlying policy for multiple years 
such premiums will be earned over the multiple periods as the exposures expire 
in and  there were no significant unearned premium portfolios or other non recurring transactions included in net premiums written 
operating costs and expenses one traditional means of measuring the underwriting performance of a property casualty insurer  such as the company  is the statutory composite ratio 
this ratio  which is based upon statutory accounting principles which differ from generally accepted accounting principles in several respects  reflects underwriting experience  but does not reflect income from investments 
a statutory composite ratio under indicates underwriting profitability  while a composite ratio exceeding indicates an underwriting loss 
set forth below are the company s statutory composite ratios for the years ended december   and and the estimated aggregate statutory composite ratios for domestic reinsurers and domestic broker market reinsurers based on data reported by the raa as of such dates years ended december  claims and claims expenses commissions and brokerage other operating expenses statutory composite ratio domestic reinsurer aggregate statutory composite ratios the company s statutory composite ratio was adversely affected during the second half of the year by underwriting results from the company s satellite business  casualty reinsurance provided by the company on business produced by a certain managing underwriting agency  and a property loss on a finite risk treaty  as set forth below dollars in millions net effect upon after tax premiums composite underwriting written ratio loss satellite business managing underwriting agency finite risk property treaty the frequency of satellite failures during has far exceeded the previous worst year in the history of this line of business 
in order to mitigate the impact of possible future loss activity  in the fourth quarter of  the company commenced the process of re underwriting and reducing its satellite business and seeking additional retrocessional protection 
there can be no assurances that any such retrocessional protection  if purchased  will be sufficient to preclude the occurrence of additional underwriting losses 
the company increased its loss reserves at december  relating to the reinsurance provided by the company on business produced by the managing underwriting agency based upon reported loss activity and the results of an underwriting audit performed by the company 
the underwriting relationship has been discontinued 
all deferred acquisition costs  which approximated million  related to the unearned premium reserve at december  have been written off by the company 
for a discussion of subsequent losses due to claims and claims expenses related to reinsurance provided by the company on satellite risks and business produced by the managing underwriting agency  see results of operations subsequent underwriting losses below and note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
while the company believes that it is taking adequate steps to reduce its exposure to losses from its satellite business and business produced by the managing underwriting agency  there can be no assurances that such business will not continue to generate additional underwriting losses in the future or that significant loss activity will not develop from other areas of the company s underwriting or other activities 
estimates of prior accident year claims were reduced by approximately million in primarily due to favorable claim development in the property and multi line classes of business 
the company s statutory composite ratio  while essentially unchanged from the ratio  contained a higher aggregate claims and claims expenses and commissions and brokerage ratio components in  which reflects a business mix with a higher casualty content 
such increase was offset by a lower other operating expenses ratio as the company continued to leverage its infrastructure with increased premium writings 
claims and claims expenses generally represent the company s most significant and uncertain costs 
reserves for these expenses are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims to cost based on facts and circumstances then known 
the reserves are based on estimates of claims and claims expenses incurred and  therefore  the amount ultimately paid may be more or less than such estimates 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating claim reserves are exacerbated for reinsurers by the significant periods of time the tail that often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the primary insurer and  ultimately  to the reinsurer  and the primary insurer s payment of that loss and subsequent indemnification by the reinsurer 
as a consequence  actual claims and claims expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates reflected in the company s reserves reported in its financial statements 
the estimation of reserves by new reinsurers  such as the company  may be less reliable than the reserve estimations of a reinsurer with an established volume of business and claims history 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  the company may have to augment such reserves and incur a charge to earnings 
see results of operations subsequent underwriting losses below and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
in pricing its reinsurance treaties  the company focuses on many factors  including exposure to claims and commissions and brokerage expenses 
commissions and brokerage expenses are acquisition costs that generally vary by the type of treaty and line of business  and are considered by the company s underwriting and actuarial staff in evaluating the adequacy of premium writings 
in a number of reinsurance treaties  provisional commissions are initially paid and subsequently increased or decreased  subject to a minimum and maximum amount  depending upon the claims and claims expenses experience of the assumed business 
the company records the commission increase or decrease in accordance with contractual terms based on the expected ultimate experience of the contract 
other operating expenses increased to million in  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
assuming the successful execution of the company s business strategy  the company expects other operating expenses to grow with maturing operations  but expects other operating expenses to decline moderately as a percentage of net premiums written because increases in premium writings are generally expected to exceed the growth in such expenses 
pre tax foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded separately from statutory underwriting results and are therefore excluded from the statutory composite ratio 
unhedged monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses recognized in income 
for the years ended december   and  pretax foreign exchange gains and losses were   and  respectively 
such future gains or losses may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates which are unpredictable and could be material 
for additional discussion  see market sensitive instruments and risk management below 
subsequent underwriting losses in march  the company was notified of additional satellite losses pertaining to in the amount of approximately million  after tax  that will be recorded in the first quarter of in order to mitigate the impact of possible future loss activity  in the fourth quarter of  the company commenced the process of re underwriting and reducing its satellite business and seeking additional retrocessional protection 
there can be no assurances that any such retrocessional protection  if purchased  will be sufficient to preclude the occurrence of additional underwriting losses 
based on a review of additional claims information and its continuing underwriting and actuarial analysis of the business produced by the managing underwriting agency  the company expects to record additional after tax underwriting losses of approximately million in the first quarter of from claims  claims expenses  commissions and brokerage  net of earned premium  relating to reinsurance on business produced by the managing underwriting agency 
total estimated ultimate premiums for all business produced on behalf of the company by the managing underwriting agency  including policies that have expired and policies that will expire in and  are approximately million  of which million and million  respectively  were recorded as net premiums written and net premiums earned through december  substantially all of the remaining million and million  respectively  of net premiums written and net premiums earned will be recorded in the first quarter of the company has discontinued its underwriting relationship with the managing underwriting agency 
therefore  the total after tax underwriting losses that will be recorded in the first quarter of generated from reinsurance on satellite risks and business produced by the managing underwriting agency will be approximately million 
while such loss estimate represents the company s current expectation based on all information available to the company to date  there can be no assurances that the actual amount will not differ from such estimate due to the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves 
see also note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
while the company believes that it is taking adequate steps to reduce its exposure to losses from its satellite business and business produced by the managing underwriting agency  there can be no assurances that such business will not continue to generate additional underwriting losses in the future or that significant loss activity will not develop from other areas of the company s underwriting or other activities 
risk retention given the company s current level of surplus  under its current underwriting guidelines  the maximum net retention on any one claim for a given property or casualty treaty risk is generally million 
the company monitors its earthquake and wind exposures and continuously reevaluates its estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures through the use of modeling techniques 
the company generally seeks to limit its probable maximum pre tax loss to no more than of its statutory surplus for severe catastrophic events that could be expected to occur once in every years 
this limitation includes combined exposure to underwriting losses  reinstatement costs for retrocessional arrangements which may be in force at the time of the losses resulting from the catastrophic event  and losses that the company may be exposed to as a result of its privately held investments in insurance and insurance related entities 
while the company believes its risk management techniques are adequate  there can be no assurances that the company will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of its statutory surplus from a catastrophic event due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such exposures 
in addition  the company believes that it cannot reasonably estimate its exposure to unrealized investment losses if any that may result from the company s investments in publicly traded securities of insurance and insurance related entities 
with respect to integrated transactions where the company combines an equity or equity like investment in a client company with the purchase by such client of reinsurance from the company  the company generally limits its combined underwriting and investment exposure to pre tax losses on any individual client to no more than of its total statutory surplus  and subjects these commitments to scrutiny by the combined professional staffs of both the company and mmci 
during  the company maintained catastrophe reinsurance protection for its marine and aviation business 
for  the company has reinsurance protection for marine business of million in excess of a million initial retention  and additional co participations  with the company retaining a total of approximately million 
for  the company is finalizing reinsurance protection for aviation business in an amount of million in excess of a million initial retention  and additional co participations  with the company retaining a total of approximately million 
catastrophic reinsurance protection has not been purchased for the company s earthquake and wind exposures 
the company continues to evaluate its potential catastrophe exposure  including both gross loss estimates and the impact of available reinsurance protection 
while the company believes its management of catastrophe exposures and underwriting guidelines are adequate  an extremely large catastrophic event  multiple catastrophic events or other unforeseen events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
net investment income at december   approximately of the company s invested assets consisted of fixed maturity and short term investments  compared to at december  net investment income was approximately million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
such amounts for  and are net of investment expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the investment expense amounts include investment advisory fees of million  million and million  respectively 
the amount of investment income from quarter to quarter may vary and could diminish as the company continues to employ its strategy of investing a substantial portion of its investment portfolio in publicly traded and privately held equity securities  which generally yield less current investment income than fixed maturity investments 
the company s investment yields at amortized cost were as follows for the periods set forth below years ended december  investment yields pre tax net of tax assuming a stable interest rate environment  the company anticipates such yields to slightly decline as funds invested in short term securities continue to be allocated by the company into investments in equity securities  which yield less current income than fixed maturity investments 
additionally  such investment yields exclude the company s equity in the net income or loss of private equity investments accounted for under the equity method 
net realized gains losses on investments in thousands years ended december  net realized investment gains losses fixed maturity securities  publicly traded equity securities    privately held securities   sub total   income tax expense benefit  net realized investment gains losses  net of tax  income taxes the company s effective tax rate of for  income tax benefit for and effective tax rate of for are less than the statutory rate on pre tax operating income due to tax exempt income and the dividends received deductions 
the  and gross deferred income tax benefits of approximately million  million and million  respectively  which are assets considered recoverable from future taxable income  resulted from temporary differences between financial and taxable income 
investments a principal component of the company s investment strategy is investing a significant portion of invested assets in publicly traded and privately held equity securities  primarily issued by insurance and reinsurance companies and companies providing services to the insurance industry 
cash and fixed maturity investments and  if necessary  the sale of marketable equity securities will be used to support shorter term liquidity requirements 
as a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio will generally consist of equity securities issued by insurance and reinsurance companies and companies providing services to the insurance industry  the equity portfolio will lack industry diversification and will be particularly subject to the performance of the insurance industry 
unlike fixed income securities  equity securities such as common stocks  including the equity securities in which the company may invest  generally are not and will not be rated by any nationally recognized rating service 
the values of equity securities generally are more dependent on the financial condition of the issuer and less dependent on fluctuations in interest rates than are the values of fixed income securities 
the market value of equity securities generally is regarded as more volatile than the market value of fixed income securities 
the effects of such volatility on the company s equity portfolio could be exacerbated to the extent that such portfolio is concentrated in the insurance industry and in relatively few issuers 
for additional discussion  see market sensitive instruments and risk management 
as the company s investment strategy is to invest a significant portion of its investment portfolio in equity securities  its investment income in any fiscal period may be smaller  as a percentage of investments  and less predictable than that of other insurance and or reinsurance companies  and net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments may have a greater effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity at the end of any fiscal period than other insurance and or reinsurance companies 
since the realization of gains and losses on equity investments is not generally predictable  such gains and losses may differ significantly from period to period 
variability and declines in the company s results of operations could be further exacerbated by private equity investments in start up companies  which are accounted for under the equity method 
such start up companies may be expected initially to generate operating losses 
investments that are or will be included in the company s private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies and by publicly traded companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
the risk of investing in such securities is generally greater than the risk of investing in securities of widely held  publicly traded companies 
lack of a secondary market and resale restrictions may result in an inability by the company to sell a security at a price that would otherwise be obtainable if such restrictions did not exist and may substantially delay the sale of a security the company seeks to sell 
at december   cash and invested assets totaled approximately million  consisting of million of cash and short term investments  million of publicly traded fixed maturity investments  million of publicly traded equity securities  and million of privately held securities 
included in privately held securities are investments totaling million which are accounted for under the equity method 
at december   the company s private equity portfolio consisted of investments  with additional investment portfolio commitments in an aggregate amount of approximately million 
since december   the portfolio increased by five additional investments and two follow on investments  and was decreased by two divestments 
in addition  the company has written down the value of two investments to their net realizable value one of which included the company s investment in the managing underwriting agency discussed above 
in october  the company provided million in financing on a fully secured basis to a managing general agency  and received a related reinsurance commitment expected to generate an aggregate of million of reinsurance premiums over the next three years pursuant to terms and conditions that the company believes are more favorable than those available in the open market 
see note under the caption investment information of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of the company for certain information regarding the company s publicly traded and privately held securities and their carrying values  and commitments made by the company relating to its privately held securities 
over the long term  the company intends to continue to allocate a substantial portion of its cash and short term investments into publicly traded and privately held equity securities  subject to market conditions and opportunities in the marketplace 
at december   approximately of the company s fixed maturity and short term investments were rated investment grade by moody s or standard poor s and had an average quality rating of aa and an average duration of approximately years 
at december   the company is obligated under letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million  which secure certain reinsurance obligations and investment commitments in amounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
securities with a carrying value of approximately million have been pledged as collateral for these letters of credit 
the company has not invested in derivative financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps  or options or other financial instruments with similar characteristics such as interest rate caps or floors and fixed rate loan commitments 
the company s portfolio includes market sensitive instruments  such as mortgage backed securities  which are subject to prepayment risk and changes in market value in connection with changes in interest rates 
the company s investments in mortgage backed securities  which amounted to approximately million at december   or of cash and invested assets  are classified as available for sale and are not held for trading purposes 
market sensitive instruments and risk management in accordance with the sec s financial reporting release no 
 the following analysis presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which are held by the company as of december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses 
market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is comprised of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company employs sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company s financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of the company s cash and invested assets  excluding investments carried under the equity method of accounting 
equity price risk the company is exposed to equity price risks on the public and private equity securities included in its investment portfolio 
all of the company s publicly traded equity securities and privately held securities were issued by insurance and reinsurance companies or companies providing services to the insurance industry 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
investments included in the company s private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies and securities issued by public companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
investments in privately held securities issued by privately and publicly held companies may include both equity securities and securities convertible into  or exercisable for  equity securities some of which may have fixed maturities 
the company s publicly traded and privately held equity securities at december   which are carried at a fair value of million and million  respectively including unrealized gains of million and million  have exposure to price risk 
the estimated potential losses in fair value for the company s publicly traded and privately held equity portfolios resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market prices  dealer quotes or fair value are million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would result in a decrease in total return of  which would produce a decrease in market value of million on the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio valued at million at december  there would be no material impact on the company s short term investments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company has foreign currency risk on both reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance balances payable  including claims and claims expenses 
the company does not currently utilize derivative instruments to manage the company s exposure to foreign currency movements 
at december   the majority of the company s net receivable payable position was denominated in united states dollars 
at such date  the largest foreign currency exposure related to cash and premiums receivable denominated in european currency units ecus  now effectively eurodollars in an amount equal to million 
a decline in the ecu united states dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a loss to the company of  in addition  the company had a net liability balance in sterling equal to million 
a increase in sterling united states dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a loss to the company of  given the company s limited amount of net receivable balances in other foreign countries  no other currency movement has been considered for purposes of this discussion 
liquidity and capital resources rchi is a holding company and has no significant operations or assets other than its ownership of all of the capital stock of risk capital reinsurance  whose primary and predominant business activity is providing reinsurance and other forms of capital to insurance and reinsurance companies and making investments in insurance related companies 
rchi will rely on cash dividends and distributions from risk capital reinsurance to pay any cash dividends to stockholders of rchi and to pay any operating expense that rchi may incur 
the payment of dividends by rchi will be dependent upon the ability of risk capital reinsurance to provide funds to rchi 
the ability of risk capital reinsurance to pay dividends or make distributions to rchi is dependent upon risk capital reinsurance s ability to achieve satisfactory underwriting and investment results and to meet certain regulatory standards of the state of nebraska 
there are presently no contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends or the making of distributions by risk capital reinsurance to rchi 
nebraska insurance laws provide that  without prior approval of the nebraska director  risk capital reinsurance cannot pay a dividend or make a distribution together with other dividends or distributions paid during the preceding months that exceeds the greater of i of statutory surplus as of the preceding december or ii statutory net income from operations from the preceding calendar year not including realized capital gains 
net income exclusive of realized capital gains not previously distributed or paid as dividends from the preceding two calendar years may be carried forward for dividends and distribution purposes 
any proposed dividend or distribution in excess of such amount is called an extraordinary dividend or distribution and may not be paid until either it has been approved  or a day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved  by the nebraska director 
notwithstanding the foregoing  nebraska insurance laws provide that any distribution that is a dividend may be paid by risk capital reinsurance only out of earned surplus arising from its business  which is defined as unassigned funds surplus as reported in the statutory financial statement filed by risk capital reinsurance with the nebraska insurance department for the most recent year 
in addition  nebraska insurance laws also provide that any distribution that is a dividend and that is in excess of risk capital reinsurance s unassigned funds  exclusive of any surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets  will be deemed an extraordinary dividend subject to the foregoing requirements 
see business insurance regulation regulation of dividends and other payments from insurance subsidiaries and note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
rchi  risk capital reinsurance and cross river file consolidated federal income tax returns and have entered into a tax sharing agreement the tax sharing agreement  allocating the consolidated income tax liability on a separate return basis 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  risk capital reinsurance and cross river make tax sharing payments to rchi based on such allocation 
net cash flow from operating activities for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  consisting principally of premiums received  investment income excluding net realized investment gains  offset by operating costs and expenses 
the primary sources of liquidity for risk capital reinsurance are net cash flow from operating activities  principally premiums received  the receipt of dividends and interest on investments and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments 
the company s cash flow is also affected by claims payments  some of which could be large 
therefore  the company s cash flow could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for any capital expenditures over the next months other than in connection with the further development of the company s infrastructure 
the company expects that its financing and operational needs for the foreseeable future will be met by the company s balance of cash and short term investments  as well as by funds generated from operations 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in the implementation of its business strategy 
at december   the company s consolidated stockholders equity totaled million  or per share based on issued and outstanding shares  and per share on a diluted basis which includes outstanding dilutive warrants and options 
at such date  statutory surplus of risk capital reinsurance was approximately million 
based on data available as of december  from the raa  risk capital reinsurance is the th largest domestic broker market oriented reinsurer as measured by statutory surplus 
the year issues many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has instituted a comprehensive year compliance plan designed to help avoid unexpected interruption in conducting its business 
the company s year initiative includes the following strategic steps o inventory of business systems and operating facilities  o assessment of potential year problems  o repair replacement of non compliant systems and facilities  o testing of systems and facilities  and o implementation of year compliant systems and facilities 
the company has completed the assessment phase for its business systems and operating facilities  and is currently in the remediation and testing phases to ensure that the company s systems and facilities are capable of processing information for the year and beyond 
the company does not currently anticipate any material year compliance problems with respect to its internal business systems and operating facilities 
based on information currently available  the cost of this internal compliance effort  while not quantified  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  due to the interdependent nature of systems and facilities  the company may be adversely impacted depending upon whether its business partners and vendors address this issue successfully 
therefore  the company is continuing to survey its key business partners and vendors in an attempt to determine their respective level of year compliance 
as part of this initiative  the company is evaluating the year exposures to insurers included in the company s investment portfolio 
the effect  if any  on the company s financial position or results of operations from the possible failure of these entities to be year compliant is not determinable 
the company has not established a contingency plan for noncompliance of its internal systems and operating facilities as the company does not currently expect any material year compliance problems with respect to such internal systems and facilities 
at this time  the company is not aware of any material business partners or vendors that will not be year compliant 
if the company becomes aware of non compliant business partners or vendors  one option will be to evaluate replacing the non compliant business partners and vendors 
the company intends to continue to assess and attempt to mitigate its risks in the event these third parities fail to be year compliant  and will consider appropriate contingency arrangements for such potential noncompliance by such entities 
in certain instances  the establishment of a contingency plan is not possible or is cost prohibitive 
in these situations  noncompliance by the company s material business partners or vendors could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in addition  property and casualty reinsurance companies  like the company  may have underwriting exposure related to the year the year issue is a risk for some of the company s reinsureds and is therefore considered during the underwriting process similar to any other risk to which the company s clients may be exposed 
due to a significant number of variables associated with the extent and severity of the year problem  the company s potential underwriting exposure to year losses cannot be determined at this time 
these variables include  but are not limited to  actual pervasiveness and severity of year system flaws  the magnitude of the amount of costs and expenses directly attributable to year failures  the portion of such amount if any that constitutes insurable losses  and the extent of governmental intervention 
the company s underwriting staff has considered the risks with respect to the year problem that might be associated with underwriting their various lines of business  and have developed internal guidelines intended to minimize these risks 
the company seeks to minimize its potential year underwriting exposures by i assisting clients in the evaluation of their potential year underwriting exposures  ii performing underwriting evaluations of its clients potential year exposure  iii structuring contract language to mitigate potential exposure where appropriate and iv recommending technical support as appropriate 
however  the company cannot be certain that these steps will adequately minimize its year underwriting exposures 
given the possible extent and severity of the year problem  the company may incur a significant amount of year related losses  and such losses may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
