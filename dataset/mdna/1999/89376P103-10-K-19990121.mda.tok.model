the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included in item of this report  and is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto 
general the business of the company is the design and supply of a range of member benefit programs to corporations  affinity groups and individuals on an international scale 
in the company and tme decided to work closely to implement a strategy to create a broader based international member benefits business 
as a result the company currently has established business operations in australia and new zealand and through its affiliates  countdown and logan leisure  has an interest in business operations in europe and elsewhere 
in addition  the company and tme have recently established business operations in the united states and in november countdown launched its transactional web site business  countdown arcade 
the future success of the company is primarily dependent upon its ability to develop and expand its current business operations by increasing their membership base and broadening the range of member benefit programs offered 
as of the date hereof  management is actively recruiting senior executives to strengthen the management team to facilitate such development and expansion 
the company will continue to look for new opportunities within the member benefits industry and may expand its operations through further acquisitions 
management believes that while the industry has shown good growth  which is expected to continue  this has been primarily in the united states 
outside the united states  the international market is significantly less developed providing an opportunity for the company to expand its operations from its established base in europe and australasia and the countdown network of sub licensees and franchisees in a number of other countries 
in light of the close collaboration between the company and tme since incorporation and  more particularly  in view of the joint ownership of countdown  countdown america  nhs  logan leisure and breakaway travel  management of the company and tme have been assessing the rationale of maintaining two separate corporate entities 
management has concluded that keeping the two companies distinct and separate is no longer appropriate or advantageous to shareholders and therefore announced its intention to merge the two companies 
in concluding that a merger is in the best interests of both the company and tme  management considered several factors including the confusion of having two separate stock quotes for essentially the same business operating in different geographical regions  the opportunity to reduce corporate overhead and to increase operating efficiency 
the proposed merger is subject to the approval of the respective boards of directors  fairness opinions by independent investment advisers and the approval of shareholders of both companies 
the company recorded significant losses in its fiscal year ended september  as well as in prior years 
such losses and the company s acquisition and expansion program to date have been funded by the sale of equity securities and debt financing 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern depends on its ability to obtain outside financing sufficient to support its operations and business development plans 
based upon the company s history of obtaining necessary financing  management remains confident that sufficient funds will be available to the company to enable it to operate for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance given that the company will obtain such short term or long term outside financing

the company increased the number of company cardholders from  at september  to  at september  the increase was largely the result of a promotion launched in september with westpac banking corp 
and a new marketing initiative in december with an australian company  fai insurance 
the arrangement with fai insurance provided for the company to issue restaurant cards free of charge to fai insurance customers 
such customers would not receive an immediate cash benefit in respect of their discount on food and beverage purchased at participating restaurants 
instead their discount was accumulated in a trust account which could be used in part payment of their subsequent years insurance premium payable to fai insurance 
the agreement gave the company the right to cancel restaurant cards issued to fai insurance customers in the event that they did not maintain minimum spend levels using their restaurant card 
the only obligation of the company was to issue restaurant cards free of charge to fai insurance customers subject to their achieving the minimum spend levels referred to above 
the number of company participating restaurants decreased from at september  to at september  this decrease resulted from of the company removing under performing restaurants from the program 
membership fees totaled   for the year ended september  a decrease of compared to the prior year 
this decrease is a result of an accounting adjustment of  to deferred membership fees in the first quarter and the effect of the free membership card 
the accounting adjustment in the first quarter reduced revenues by  the adjustment was necessary to correct an accounting error in the calculation of deferred membership fees as of december  it is the company s policy to account for membership fee revenue over the period of membership  usually one year 
an error in the calculation of deferred membership fee income was discovered subsequent to the finalization of the unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended december  the error was corrected in the quarter ended march  previous periods were not adjusted because the amount involved was not considered material

cost of sales are approximately of the gross food and beverage value consumed by cardholders and represents recovery of advances made by the company to participating restaurants 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of salaries  rents  commissions  and other general overheads totaled   for the year ended september   an increase of over the previous year

cec radbone  a former director of the company

the company has funded operations through sales of equity securities and issuance of debt  and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company s ability to continue to effect such sales of equity and issue of debt 
during fiscal the company relied on net revenues and the net proceeds of equity placements and short term debt financing to fund its operating needs and investments 
management has taken steps to reduce the amount of cash used by operations  including reducing staffing levels  however the company s operations may not provide sufficient internally generated cash flows to meet its projected requirements in the short term 
accordingly  the company will require further capital infusions in order to meet its loan repayment commitments and the ongoing funding requirements of its operations 
based upon the company s history of obtaining necessary financing  management remains confident that sufficient funds will be available for the company to operate in the foreseeable future and meet its loan repayment obligations 
however there can be no assurance given that the company will be able to obtain such funding 
historically  the company s ability to grow and generate cash from operations has been restricted by the single product offered  the transmedia dining card 
however  in recent years the company and tme have worked closely to implement a strategy to create a broader based international member benefits business 
as a result the company currently has established business operations in australia and new zealand and through its affiliates  countdown and logan leisure  has an interest in business operations in europe and elsewhere 
in addition  the company and tme have recently established business operations in the united states and in november countdown launched its transactional web site business  countdown arcade 
management believes that after completion of the proposed merger with tme  the company and tme will be well positioned to achieve profitability in the medium term 
however  there can be no assurance given that the proposed merger will be completed or when  if at all  profitability will be achieved 
inflation and seasonality the company does not believe that its operations have been materially influenced by inflation in the fiscal year ended september   a situation which is expected to continue for foreseeable future 
some of the company s individual businesses such as teletravel and breakaway are seasonal  as is the company s restaurant card business albeit to a lesser extent 
however  the company has no basis at this time on which to project the seasonal effects  if any  on its business as a whole 
effect of year the company has developed a plan to address the possible exposure related to the impact of the year on its computer systems 
key operating  financial and management information systems have been assessed and plans have been developed to address required systems modifications by december  the financial impact of making the required system changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
management currently estimates the likely cost of system modifications to be approximately  in fiscal the company established a year group to evaluate the potential exposure of the company s computer systems and computer reliant systems to year issues 
the working group completed its evaluation and has developed a plan to ensure that all of the company s systems will be fully compliant by december  the core business system used in the company s restaurant card business is not year compliant and could fail to operate into the next millennium without corrective action 
the system was scheduled to be re written in any event  with completion planned for the fourth quarter of interim systems have been fully tested and will be implemented during the first quarter of as a precautionary measure 
in other areas of the company s operations systems are year compliant 
breakaway is fully compliant  as are the telephone systems used by nhs 
non core business applications such as word processing and management information reporting systems require some minor modification 
computer hardware has been substantially upgraded to appropriate processors 
the systems of the company s affiliate  countdown  have also been evaluated 
countdown systems require some modification and upgrading which is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of the company is in communication with others with whom it does business  including but not limited to  financial institutions and key customers  to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
in particular the company has not yet received confirmations from a number of banking institutions 
there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties  on which the company s systems rely  will be converted on a timely basis  or that a failure to convert or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems would not have a material adverse effect on the company
