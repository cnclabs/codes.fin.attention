item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general most of the company s processing consists of aluminum tolled for its customers 
to a lesser but increasing extent  the company s processing also consists of zinc and aluminum buy sell business  which involves purchasing scrap metal and dross for further processing and resale 
the company s zinc processing and aluminum alloying operations consist primarily of buy sell transactions 
the company s buy sell business revenues include the cost of the metal  the processing cost and the company s profit margin 
tolling revenues reflect only the processing cost and the company s profit margin 
accordingly  tolling business produces lower revenues and costs of sales than does the buy sell business 
variations in the mix of these two businesses can cause revenues to change significantly from period to period while not significantly affecting gross profit  since both types of business generally produce approximately the same gross profit per pound of metal processed 
as a result  the company considers processing volume to be a more important determinant of performance than revenues 
the company s coldwater  michigan aluminum alloying facility acquired in november is primarily engaged in buy sell business  as opposed to tolling  and with the recent acquisition of us zinc see acquisition below  the level of overall buy sell business  relative to tolling  for the company increased during the higher levels of buy sell business increase the company s working capital requirements and subject the company to greater risks associated with price fluctuations in the metals markets 
during the s  aluminum inventories on the worldwide commodity exchanges fluctuated from severe excesses to relatively balanced positions 
in times of excess  aluminum prices declined  negatively impacting the profitability of the major aluminum producers who are some of the company s largest customers 
environments of low profitability for the company s customers have inhibited  during those times  the company s ability to pass cost increases through to its customers 
during  the us domestic aluminum industry benefited from increases in aluminum prices and an increase in demand 
however  during the fourth quarter of and throughout  aluminum prices declined  which negatively impacted the company s selling prices of aluminum  especially at its salt cake processing facility in kentucky 
also during  zinc prices declined sharply from their relatively high levels in the third quarter of it is not possible to predict the future price of aluminum or zinc  or the level of worldwide inventories of these metals and whether  or to what extent  such factors will affect the company s future business

in addition to its increased emphasis on the buy sell business  the company has also entered into an increasing number of metal brokerage transactions each year pursuant to which the company buys metal from primary and other producers  and then sells the metal to end users 
these transactions involve buying and selling metal without processing it 
additionally  in order to facilitate acquiring metal for its production process  the company occasionally enters into metal swap transactions whereby the company agrees to exchange its recycled finished goods for scrap raw materials 
as with the buy sell business  the brokerage business also increases the company s working capital requirements and subjects the company to greater price risk associated with fluctuations in the metal commodity markets

harvard  as reorganized  has commenced execution of the plan 
the company anticipates that upon allowance of its claims  it will receive its pro rata share of common stock of reorganized harvard as provided in the plan 
while the company currently believes that harvard s bankruptcy will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  no assurance can be given as to the amount in which the company s claims will be allowed and or the timing and value of the company s ultimate recovery  if any  on its claims 
the company believes that its cash on hand  the resources available under the terms of its amended and restated credit agreement and anticipated cash provided by operations should provide the financial resources necessary to fund its capital requirements and to meet its obligations for and the foreseeable future 
environmental the company s operations  like those of other basic industries  are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes and impose liability for costs of cleaning up  and certain damages resulting from past spills  disposals  or other releases of hazardous substances 
it is possible that more rigorous environmental laws and regulations will be adopted that could require the company to make substantial expenditures in addition to those referred to in this form k and in other filings made by the company 
from time to time  operations of the company have resulted or may result in certain noncompliance with applicable requirements under environmental laws 
however  the company believes that any such non compliance under such environmental laws would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the illinois environmental protection agency iepa recently notified the company that a subsidiary  interamerican zinc  inc  izi is a potentially responsible party prp pursuant to the illinois environmental protection act for the cleanup of contamination at a site in marion county  illinois to which izi  among others  in the past sent zinc oxide for processing and resale 
izi has joined a group of prps that is planning to negotiate with the iepa regarding the cleanup of the site 
although the site has not been fully investigated and final cleanup costs not yet determined  based on current cost estimates and information regarding the amount and type of materials sent to the site by izi  the company does not believe  while there can be no assurance  that its liability at this site will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
year compliance the company relies on software and hardware technology for its information and data processing and to deliver its services  and has established a comprehensive plan to address potential year compliance problems resulting from the computer programs written utilizing two digits  instead of four  to represent the year 
the company s embedded systems or non information technology systems include office equipment such as phone and voicemail systems  fax machines  copiers  and postage machines  as well as environmental and manufacturing control systems at its plants 
these environmental and manufacturing systems at the company s plant locations consist of items such as scales  process controllers  programmable logic controllers  adjustable frequency drives  and radiation detection systems 
the company has completed a physical inventory of its information technology computer hardware and software  and its embedded systems at each facility 
the company s assessment phase  currently in progress  entails obtaining manufacturer and developer year compliance information about embedded systems and software 
this process is ongoing and is currently expected to be completed in april all personal computer hardware compliance testing and remediation is also anticipated to be completed by april testing of embedded systems and desktop application software is ongoing and expected to be completed by july the company believes that its primary information technology operations and accounting software are year compliant 
because of the company s recent rapid growth and the need to integrate its financial and operating systems  the company is in the process of implementing an enterprise wide information technology system  which has been tested to be year compliant 
when complete  this will enable the company to gather more uniform operating and financial information  and do so in less time than is currently required 
the company has identified potential year compliance issues with certain subsidiaries and a joint venture partner  and is currently converting and modifying those systems in order to achieve year compliance 
the cumulative year project expenditures have been immaterial to date  and based upon results of current testing  the estimated remaining year costs are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company currently believes that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on its business  financial position or results of operations 
the company cannot presently determine the impact on its customers and suppliers in the event that any of them may be year non compliant  and in such event  whether such non compliance may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company has contacted its customers and suppliers via written questionnaires and verbal inquiries to determine the status of their respective year compliance programs and is currently reviewing the responses and taking additional actions  such as further inquiries and personal follow up interviews  on an as needed basis 
an unexpected or widespread year problem involving the company and or its suppliers and customers could result in a significant interruption to the company s normal business operations or activities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company is preparing for this uncertainty through its remediation efforts and its ongoing investigation of its suppliers and customers referred to above 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan  but based upon completion of its assessments and investigations discussed above  plans to develop such a plan 
currently  the development of such a contingency plan is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of conversion to the euro currency on january   certain members of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency the euro 
the company conducts business through a joint venture in one member country 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is between january  and june  the company is addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
the more important issues facing the company include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  and processing tax and accounting records 
based on progress to date  the company believes that use of the euro will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its business affairs and processes its business and accounting records 
accordingly  conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
cautionary statement for purposes of forward looking statements certain information contained in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as certain oral statements made by or on behalf of the company may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to the safe harbor provisions in that enacted legislation 
this information includes  without limitation  statements concerning future capacity  volumes  revenues  earnings  costs  margins and expenses  the expected effects of strikes or work stoppages at company customer facilities  future acquisitions or corporate combinations  expected effects of the recent us zinc acquisition  future prices for metals  plans for domestic or international expansion  facility construction schedules and projected completion dates including that of its recently announced saginaw  michigan plant  and anticipated technological advances  future capabilities of the company to achieve closed loop recycling on a commercially efficient basis  prospects for the company s joint venture partners to purchase a portion of the company s interests  future or extensions of existing long term supply contracts with its customers  the outcome of and any liabilities resulting from any claims  investigations or proceedings against the company or its subsidiaries  future levels of dividends if any  the future mix of business  future asset recoveries  future operations  future demand  future industry conditions  future capital expenditures and future financial condition  effects of the euro conversion on the company s operations and results of operations  and the extent of the company s year compliance  its timetable for becoming year compliant  and impact of the year transition on the operations  results of operations and financial condition of the company  its customers and suppliers 
these statements are based on current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
when used in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k  the words anticipate  estimate  expect  may  project and similar expressions are intended to be among the statements that identify forward looking statements 
important factors that could affect the company s actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those results that might be projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by the company in these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following fluctuations in operating levels at the company s facilities  the mix of buy sell business as opposed to tolling business  retention and financial condition of major customers  effects of future costs  collectibility of receivables  the inherent unpredictability of adversarial or administrative proceedings  effects of environmental and other governmental regulations  currency exchange rate fluctuations  trends in the company s key markets  the price of and supply and demand for aluminum and zinc and their derivatives on world markets  business conditions and growth in the aluminum and zinc industries and aluminum and zinc recycling industries  the extent of year compliance by the company s suppliers and customers and the company s information technology and embedded systems technology  and future levels and timing of capital expenditures 
these statements are further qualified by the following estimates of future operating rates at the company s plants are based on current expectations by management of the company of future levels of volumes and prices for the company s services or metal  and are subject to fluctuations in customer demand for the company s services and prevailing conditions in the metal markets  as well as certain components of the company s cost of operations  including energy and labor costs 
many of the factors affecting revenues and costs are outside of the control of the company  including weather conditions  general economic and financial market conditions  and governmental regulation and factors involved in administrative and other proceedings 
the future mix of buy sell vs 
tolling business is dependent on customers needs and overall demand  world and us market conditions then prevailing in the respective metal markets  and the operating levels at the company s various facilities at the relevant time 
the price of primary aluminum  zinc and other metals is subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences 
prices can be volatile  which could affect the company s buy sell metals business 
the company s use of contractual arrangements including long term agreements and forward contracts  may reduce the company s exposure to this volatility but does not eliminate it 
the markets for most aluminum and zinc products are highly competitive 
the major primary aluminum producers are larger than the company in terms of total assets and operations and have greater financial resources 
in addition  aluminum competes with other materials such as steel  vinyl  plastics and glass  among others  for various applications in the company s key markets 
unanticipated actions or developments by or affecting the company s competitors and or willingness of customers to accept substitutions for aluminum products could affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
fluctuations in the costs of fuels  raw materials and labor can affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
weather delays and labor and materials shortages can adversely affect the construction schedules of the company s new facilities 
the company s key transportation market is cyclical  and sales within that market in particular can be influenced by economic conditions 
strikes and work stoppages by automotive customers of the company may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a strike at a customer facility or a significant downturn in the business of a key customer supplied by the company could affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company spends substantial capital and operating amounts relating to ongoing compliance with environmental laws 
in addition  the company is involved in certain investigations and actions in connection with environmental compliance and past disposals of solid waste 
estimating future environmental compliance and remediation costs is imprecise due to the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements and uncertainties about their application to the company s operations  the availability and applicability of technology and the allocation of costs among principally responsible parties 
unanticipated material legal proceedings or investigations could affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to potential losses arising from changes in the price of aluminum  zinc and natural gas  and the level of interest rates 
the company uses derivative instruments  such as futures  options  swaps and interest rate caps to manage the effect of such changes

metal commodity price risk 
aluminum and zinc ingots are internationally produced  priced  and traded commodities  with their principal trading market being the london metal exchange lme 
in order to preserve margins  the company enters into futures and options contracts 
aluminum 
the company enters into futures sale contracts with metal brokers to fix the margin on a portion of the aluminum generated by the company s salt cake processing facility in kentucky and aluminum generated from the processing of other scrap items having minimal or no cost associated in obtaining them 
these futures sale contracts are settled in the month of shipment 
estimated total production covered under these futures sale contracts as of december  was  metric tonnes mt 
the impact of a change in the december  price of aluminum ingot per the lme would be immaterial on the company s gross profit for the year ended december  zinc 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into fixed price forward sales contracts with a number of its zinc customers 
at december  such contracts had metal deliveries committed during of  mt 
the company may enter into similar arrangements in the future 
in order to hedge the risk of higher metal prices the company enters into long positions  principally using future purchase contracts
