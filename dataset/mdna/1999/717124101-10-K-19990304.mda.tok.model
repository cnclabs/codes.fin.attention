as of december   the company had million outstanding under this facility 
this credit facility expires in march  at which time the outstanding balance is due 
the company plans to renegotiate this credit facility before its expiration date 
the company expects to continue expanding its operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
the company expects such activities will be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations  borrowings under its credit facilities and through the use of the company s stock 
the company believes that such sources of cash will be sufficient to fund the company s current operations for at least the next months 
the company is currently evaluating a number of acquisitions and other growth opportunities which may require additional external financing  and the company may seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies in a very wide variety of applications may experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the four digit field 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with the year the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year failures and has established an internal review team to address the year issue that encompasses operating and administrative areas of the company 
during the first quarter of  a team of experienced information technology staff was assigned to work with company personnel to identify and resolve significant year issues in a timely manner 
in addition  executive management regularly monitors the status of the company s year remediation plans 
the process includes an assessment of issues and development of remediation plans  execution of those plans and testing of all technology affected by this issue 
in addition  the company is engaged in assessing the year issue with significant suppliers and clients 
at december   the assessment process is complete for all equipment including computer hardware and software technology used internally by the company as compared to at september  the company has also determined that it is unlikely that it will have any material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue in connection with services and products sold by the company 
remediation is well underway  with approximately of all systems requiring remediation completed at december  as compared to at september  all systems  regardless of whether they require remediation  are being tested to ensure year compliance 
the company has completed testing for year compliance as of december  for of our systems as compared to at september  the company expects to complete this effort by april the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers in north america and europe to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to third party failure to remediate year compliance problems 
the company is in regular communication with key suppliers and clients and responds promptly to all requests for information regarding year compliance 
based on current information available  management believes that it will be able to perform all services and provide all products it currently offers without any material adverse effects arising from failure to remediate deficiencies arising from year external and internal costs specifically associated with applying vendor upgrades  testing and modifying internal use software for year compliance are expensed as incurred 
the company pays for year expenses with cash from operating activities 
the percentage of the company s information technology budget expected to be used for remediation is approximately in and in to date  the company has spent million on year compliance  and expects to spend an additional million to complete the compliance process 
of the total amount that the company expects to spend  million is attributable to internal labor costs for assessment and testing 
although internal resources have been dedicated to year efforts  work has been spread across all areas and there has been no material delay in any major projects 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company has represented to some clients that it intends to be year compliant by april if unexpected issues arise causing delays in the clinical studies being performed for these clients  the company will have a specified period of time to correct those issues 
if not corrected  the client can modify or terminate its contract with the company 
the company believes that modification or termination of one or more client contracts represents the most reasonably likely adverse event which might arise from material year compliance failures 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and clients  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company expects to significantly reduce the level of uncertainty about year problems and  in particular  about year compliance and readiness of its key suppliers and clients  as it nears completion of the inquiry  testing and replacement phase 
the company also believes that its experienced information technology staff  which has been instrumental in the company s year compliance efforts  may be able to mitigate many year problems 
however  the company will continue to assess and develop contingency plans for a possible year failure as it completes its testing of year issues 
the cost of the year compliance project and the time by which the company expects to complete its year assessment and remediation are estimates  based on numerous assumptions  including the continued availability of funding resources and third party modification plans 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates are accurate and will be achieved  and actual results could differ significantly from management s expectations 
in addition  there is no guarantee that the company s evaluation of the most likely effects of a material year compliance failure is correct  or that its plan to address such failure will be adequate 
in either instance  the effect upon the company s financial condition could be material 
exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls the vast majority of the company s contracts are entered into by the company s united states or united kingdom subsidiaries 
the contracts entered into by the united states subsidiaries are almost always denominated in united states dollars 
contracts between the company s united kingdom subsidiaries and their clients are generally denominated in pounds sterling 
substantially all of the united kingdom subsidiaries expenses  such as salaries  services  materials and supplies  are paid in pounds sterling 
however  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results  and also affect the amounts in dollars actually received by the company from such subsidiaries 
the company currently participates in only a small number of transactions involving multiple currencies 
in most of those situations  contractual provisions either limit or reduce the translation risk 
financial statement translation has not  to date  been material to the company s balance sheet 
the reasons for this are that the majority of international operations are located in the united kingdom  which traditionally has had a relatively stable currency  and that international operations have not accounted for a significant portion of total operations approximately 
it is anticipated that those conditions will persist for at least through december  there are no material exchange controls currently in effect in any country in which the company s subsidiaries conduct operations on the payment of dividends or otherwise restricting the transfer of funds outside such countries by a company resident in such countries 
although the company performs services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions  to date  the company has not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries 
however  if any such jurisdictions were to impose or modify existing exchange control restrictions on the remittance of funds to the company  such restrictions could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price the company s quarterly operating results are subject to volatility due to such factors as the commencement  completion or cancellation of large contracts  progress of ongoing contracts  acquisitions  the timing of start up expenses for new offices  management of growth  and changes in the mix of services 
since a large percentage of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect quarterly results 
to the extent the company s international business increases  exchange rate fluctuations and other international business risks may also influence these results 
the company believes that comparisons of its quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
however  fluctuations in quarterly results or other factors beyond the company s control  such as changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the cro  environmental  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and general economic conditions  could affect the market price of the common stock in a manner unrelated to the longer term operating performance of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risk by virtue of its international operations 
the company conducts business in several foreign countries and approximately  and of the company s net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
funds generated by each subsidiary of the company are generally reinvested in the country where they are earned 
the operations in the united kingdom have generated more than of the company s revenue from foreign operations 
accordingly  some exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in the pound sterling 
the united kingdom has traditionally had a relatively stable currency 
it is anticipated that those conditions will persist for at least through december  additionally  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the company s subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
translation adjustments are reported with accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
financial statement translation has not  to date  been material to the company s balance sheet 
such adjustments may in the future be material to the company s financial statements
