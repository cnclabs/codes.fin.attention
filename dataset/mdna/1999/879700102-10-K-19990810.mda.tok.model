see factors that may affect future results below and other cautionary statements appearing under item business and elsewhere  in this form k for a discussion of the important factors affecting the realization of those results or the occurrence of those events 
on february   the company announced that it would restate its previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years  and  and its unaudited interim financial statements for the first and second quarters of fiscal additionally  the company announced on june   that it would further restate its results for the second quarter of fiscal these restatements were based upon the completion of a review of certain judgmental accounting matters by the audit committee of the board of directors  the company s management and the company s outside auditors  pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
see note restatement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail concerning the restatement adjustments made 
the financial information for all periods included in the following discussion gives effect to the restatement 
overview in fiscal  the company recorded a net loss of million or per common share diluted as compared to net income of million or 
per common share diluted recorded in fiscal consolidated revenues decreased million or from fiscal levels 
the fiscal results included significant inventory and other charges related to the discontinuance of certain of the company s products aggregating million 
additionally  the company s results include a tax provision of million on a pre tax loss due to a valuation allowance of million established against the net deferred tax asset at the beginning of the year and foreign income taxes of million 
no tax benefit has been recognized for the fiscal net operating loss based on the company s current assessment regarding the utilization of such assets 
the fiscal results included million of costs incurred in response to takeover and proxy contest proposals as well as terminated discussions of proposed business combination transactions 
these charges  as well as other significant charges item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued relating primarily to inventory  accounts receivable  severance  stock compensation and investment valuation are discussed below 
the company anticipates that it will incur an operating loss in fiscal as the company s new management team continues its review of all aspects of its operations to improve profitability 
management actions taken to increase the efficiency of the company s operations may result in one time charges in fiscal the company operates in a rapidly changing and dynamic market  and the company s strategies and plans are designed to adapt to changing market conditions where and when possible 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s management will identify the risks especially those newly emerging from time to time affecting  and their impact on  the company and its business 
further  there is no assurance that the company s strategies and plans will take into account all market conditions and changes thereto or that such strategies and plans will be successfully implemented 
accordingly  neither the historical results presented in the company s consolidated financial statements and discussed herein  nor any forward looking statements in this form k  are necessarily indicative of the company s future results 
see factors that may affect future results for a discussion of risk factors which may affect the company s future results of operations 
factors that may affect future results the risks and other important factors which may affect the company s business  operating results  and financial and other conditions include  without limitation  the following the company s results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including economic conditions generally both domestic and foreign as well as those specific to the industry in which it competes  decreases in average selling price over the life of any particular product  the timing  manufacturing complexity and expense of new product introductions both by the company and its competitors  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market  the rapid increase in demand for some products and the rapid decline in demand for others and the company s ability to anticipate and plan for that changing market demand 
certain of these factors are beyond the company s control 
historically  the company s shipments during any particular quarter generally represent orders received either during that quarter or shortly before the beginning of that quarter 
there can be no assurance that during any given quarter the company will have on hand or can timely procure the appropriate mix of purchased components to accommodate the delivery requirements of its customers for such orders 
therefore  the company s financial performance in any quarter is dependent to a significant degree upon obtaining orders which can be manufactured and delivered to its customers in that quarter 
as a result  financial performance for any given quarter cannot be known or fully assessed until near the end of that quarter 
the company has also historically recognized a substantial portion of its product revenues in the last month of each quarter 
a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and timing of increases in such expenses is based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet expectations  the company may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s sales efforts have increasingly been focused on sales  both by the company directly and through oems  vars  isvs and other indirect sales channels  of complete data transaction systems rather than on sales of handheld computer products alone 
system sales tend to be more costly and  therefore  require a longer selling cycle  longer payment terms and more complex integration and installation services 
the company s recognition of revenue from systems sales may be delayed as a result of the extended time that may be required to complete these roll outs  correct any product non conformance issues that may be encountered and achieve customer acceptance 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and characterized by increasingly rapid technological change  introduction of new products with improved performance characteristics  product obsolescence and price erosion 
failure to keep pace with product and technological advances could negatively affect the company s competitive position and prospects for growth 
customers anticipation of new or enhanced product offerings by the company or a competitor may lead them to defer purchases of the company s existing products 
in addition  companies that are participants in the broader computer industry are potential competitors 
some of the company s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  intellectual property  marketing and human resources than the company 
the company s future success depends on its ability to develop and rapidly bring to market technologically advanced products through internal development as well as through the licensing or other acquisition of new technologies 
historically  the company s development activities have included investments in or acquisitions of development stage and other entities who possess or who could potentially possess strategically important technologies 
due to the nature of these entities and their operations  there can be no assurance that these investments will be realizable or profitable or will result in marketable and or successful products 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development activities will lead to the commercially successful introduction of new or improved products or that the company will not encounter delays or problems in connection with those products 
the cost of perfecting new and improved technologies to satisfy customer quality and delivery expectations as they are brought to market cannot always be fully anticipated and may adversely affect company operating profits during such introductions 
in addition  the average selling prices for computer products generally decrease over the products lives 
to mitigate such decreases  the company seeks to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products and to introduce new products  functions and other price performance enhancing features 
to the extent that these product enhancements do not occur on a timely basis or do not result in a sufficient increase in sales prices to end users  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
to date  the company s revenues have been concentrated in the retail industry  historically representing over of its total revenues 
among other factors  the economic condition and prospects of current and prospective customers in the markets which the company serves may affect the company s own financial results 
the company s future growth depends  in part  on its ability to successfully penetrate and expand its revenues in new markets as well as increased penetration in the retail market 
there can be no assurance that penetration and expansion into new and existing markets can be profitably achieved 
the company regards certain of its hardware and software technologies as proprietary and relies on a combination of united states and foreign patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as license and other contractual confidentiality provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
despite the company s efforts to safeguard its proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so or that the company s competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to or otherwise circumvent the company s technologies and proprietary rights 
the company s products utilize hardware and software technologies licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to license needed technology in the future 
an early termination of certain of these license agreements including patent rights licensed from symbol technologies  inc  one of its principal competitors  necessary for the company s manufacture and sale of its integrated laser scanning terminals which account for a material portion of the company s current sales could have a materially adverse effect on the company s ability to market certain of its products and  hence  on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that its products  processes and trademarks do not infringe on the rights of third parties  but third parties have asserted  and there can be no assurance that they will not in the future assert  infringement or other related claims against the company or its licensors 
any infringement claim or related litigation against the company  or any challenge to the validity of the company s own intellectual property rights  and the expense of defending the same could materially adversely effect the company s ability to market its products and  hence  its business  results of operations and financial condition 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain of the company s products  sub assemblies and components are procured from single source suppliers  and others are procured from only a limited number of suppliers 
the company has in the past encountered  and may in the future encounter  shortages of supplies and delays in deliveries of product  sub assemblies and components from its third party suppliers 
such shortages and delays  or should any third party supplier become unable or unwilling to supply such items to the company consistent with the company s volume and quality requirements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to ship products  and in turn  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a substantial portion of the company s total revenues  ranging from approximately in recent years  is from customers located outside of the united states  the company s results could be negatively affected by global and regional economic conditions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures  regulatory acceptance of the company s products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable collection patterns and other considerations peculiar to the conduct of international business 
additionally  the company is subject to similar risks in its procurement of certain of its products  components and sub assemblies outside the united states 
as a particular instance  the financial press has widely reported the significant economic difficulties which recently have been or are being experienced by a number of asian economies 
while the company s cost of doing business in the affected asian countries has declined as a result of those difficulties  the revenues derived from such countries which have historically not been material in amount are likely to be adversely affected by those difficulties 
in the event of a significant adverse change in asian business conditions due to government economic regulation  civil unrest or otherwise  or should economic difficulties in such countries spread or have an adverse impact of business activities in north america  europe and or elsewhere in the world  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
certain of the company s products intentionally transmit radio signals as part of their normal operation 
these products are subject to regulatory approval  restrictions on the use of certain frequencies and the creation of interference  and other requirements by the federal communications commission and corresponding authorities in each country in which they are marketed 
regulatory changes could significantly impact the company s operations by restricting the company s development efforts  making current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
the intentional emission of electromagnetic radiation has also been the subject of recent public concern regarding possible health and safety risks  and though the company believes that the low power output and the distance typically maintained between a product and the user means that its products do not pose material safety concerns  there can be no assurance that such safety issues will not arise in the future and will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s new management team is working to implement a comprehensive business strategy to stabilize the company and position it for future  profitable growth 
key elements of that strategic plan include a design to cost program and mrp ii material resource planning process 
though management believes that its business process improvement initiatives are the best means for improving the company s business operations  financial results and future prospects  there can be no assurance that management will be able to obtain and successfully deploy the necessary technical  production  financial  human and other resources and otherwise implement these strategies or that these strategies will achieve their desired results 
for a discussion of the financial resources available to management  see financial condition liquidity vs 
below 
if the company is unable to successfully achieve and manage the desired growth  its business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
among other things  the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract  to effectively motivate and manage and to retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is in the process of completing the development and installation of new corporate wide information systems 
the new systems should provide the company s new management team with the systems support necessary for the implementation of its business process changes 
though the implementation of the new systems could disrupt the normal flow of the company s operations in the near term  including manufacturing schedules  invoicing procedures and resulting cash flows  no such material disruption has been experienced to date 
there can be no assurance that disruptions of this nature will not occur that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
in addition to the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this form k which may adversely affect the company s conduct of its business and the results thereof  the company s financial condition is also subject to the possible adverse effects of certain pending litigation and other contingencies discussed above under item legal proceedings  and in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included below in item in this form k 
readiness for the year the information set forth under this caption is hereby designated to be a year readiness disclosure under the year information readiness disclosure act the year act  public law  and the statements below and the registrant  as the maker thereof  shall be entitled to the protections provided by the year act 
as the end of the twentieth century nears  there is worldwide concern regarding the use by many existing computer programs of only the last two digits rather than four to identify the year in a date field 
if not corrected  many computer applications may fail to treat year dates intended to represent years in the twenty first century as such but instead treat them as still in the twentieth century  potentially resulting in system failure or miscalculations disruptive of business operations  including  among other things  an inability to initiate  receive  process  invoice or otherwise complete normal business activities 
these year issues affect virtually all companies and organizations 
year issues affect both the company s offerings of computer products and related services to its customers as well as its own operations 
the year readiness of the company s operations in turn involves not only its corporate information systems but also computer based systems used directly in the conduct of its business process management systems  such as hardware and software engineering design tools  manufacturing equipment and customer service and maintenance tracking systems 
in addition  the company could also be affected by the year readiness of its customers and of its suppliers of raw materials  components  peripherals  finished products and software and its providers of facilities  equipment and services 
the costs of the company s year readiness efforts are being funded from the company s consolidated operating cash flows and borrowings 
with respect to its products  the company has identified those that are or will be made year ready 
those already or to be made year ready products represent the existing products which management believes will continue to be a significant part of the company s ongoing product line 
customers may continue to order the company s other existing products  but with no assurance from the company as to their year readiness or the feasibility or availability of an upgrade path to readiness 
all new products are being designed to be year ready 
the company has completed the software firmware upgrades for its products which were identified to be made year ready  subject to the completion of debugging activities 
subject to negotiated contractual commitments  the company will make the upgrades available free of charge for products purchased after december  which were ordered with the latest software version as of the order date  an upgrade fee will be charged customers who requested an older software version when they ordered the equipment 
customers will item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued be responsible for installing the upgrades  or they may retain the company to do so for a fee 
the costs to date of upgrading the company s products to year readiness have not been  and the company does not expect that the remaining cost of doing so will be  material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has purchased and is working with outside contractors to develop and install new corporate wide information systems 
though the new systems were identified as a strategic business initiative independent of year considerations  they are also being designed to make the company s information systems year ready 
to date  the company has installed the following phases of the new systems installation key financial reporting  accounting  services help desk and contract billing  order entry  manufacturing  engineering documents management  and accounts receivable 
one to four additional months of work may be required in order to achieve full user acceptance of these installed systems 
while the new information systems will be dynamic ones permitting ongoing improvements as business needs are identified  the basic operational systems remaining to be installed are the product repair and service management systems 
the installation of these remaining systems is expected to be substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal the total capital expenditures for the new systems installation  including the addition of interfaces for bolt on enhancements  is presently estimated to be approximately million 
in addition  the company will also accelerate the replacement of approximately million of computer hardware in connection with the new systems installation 
as of march   the company had spent approximately million in capital expenditures  purchased 
million of replacement computer hardware and leased an additional million of replacement computer hardware 
the company anticipates that it will lease all of its remaining replacement hardware requirements 
the forgoing time and cost targets are management s current best estimates based on presently available information and numerous assumptions 
given the uncertainties and complexities inherent in any new system installation  there can be no assurance that the project will be completed within the expected time and cost parameters 
the company s monthly systems development expenditures have ranged from approximately million to approximately million 
in addition to these capitalized expenditures  the company had incurred approximately million of non capitalizable expenses as of march   related to the new systems installation 
these non capitalizable expenses exclude the one time  after tax charge of million recorded during fiscal as a change in accounting principle in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force consensus ruling accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology transformation 
the company estimates that it may incur an additional million in non capitalizable expenses in connection with the completion of the initial installation of the new systems 
the company has engaged an outside consultant to evaluate the year readiness of its engineering  manufacturing and customer maintenance and service process management systems and information technology infrastructure 
the consultant s findings and recommendations were received by the company on february  the year readiness inventory compiled by the consultant has been under continuing  extensive review by teams  including senior management  from each of the affected functional areas 
giving effect to the teams remediation efforts to date  approximately of the inventoried items are currently year ready 
the costs of the study and resulting remediation have not been material to date  with the remediation costs being borne by the respective functional areas 
the functional teams continue to work toward completing their review and any necessary remediation as soon as practicable 
to the extent any further year issues are identified  remediation options will include re writing the affected software or replacing the affected hardware or software with hardware or software that is year ready 
the company believes that  in general  replacement  year ready hardware and software for its process management systems and information technology infrastructure are readily available  making that the most likely means of addressing any remaining remediation needs 
the timetable and cost for any further remediation that may be required with respect to the company s process management systems cannot be estimated 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to the extent that the re writing of affected software is selected as the means for remediating any year issues  whether in preparing upgrades to company products  making process management systems year ready or otherwise  given the technical nature of the task of isolating and correcting non compliant programming and the limited internal resources available  the increasing demand for available external resources and the company s ability to fund the use of external resources to perform the work  there can be no assurances as to if  when and at what cost any such software work can be completed 
the company s own year readiness is also affected by the year readiness of its customers as well as of its suppliers of raw materials  components  peripherals  finished products and software and its providers of facilities  equipment and services and any failure on their part to achieve readiness in their own operations or with respect to the items they supply or otherwise provide to the company 
insofar as no single customer has accounted for more than ten percent of the company s revenues in recent fiscal years  the company does not anticipate that its operating results will be materially adversely affected by the failure of any particular customer to itself be year ready 
the volume of year inquiries which the company has received from its customers regarding the year readiness of the company products they use further suggests that the company s customers are addressing their year issues 
the company has made year readiness inquiries of the current suppliers to its engineering  manufacturing and service functions and is assessing the responses  which to date have been received from approximately three quarters of those suppliers 
the responses received from the suppliers have not identified any material year issues but generally indicate only that the respective suppliers are in the midst of their own year readiness efforts 
the company has also made readiness inquires of its providers of facilities and related equipment and services elevators  hvac  utilities  etc as the result of a limited number of potential year issues  which those inquiries have identified to date  the company has replaced or is in the process of updating the affected items at a nominal cost 
the company is still in the process of receiving  assessing and following up on the providers responses  most of which have indicated only that the respective providers are in the midst of their own year readiness efforts 
there are several possible scenarios  which  alone or in aggregate  could  depending on the particular circumstances  materially adversely affect the company s business and or its financial results or conditions 
these scenarios could affect the year readiness of the company s own product or service offerings  disrupt its business operations or negatively impact its operating results 
the company could be adversely affected by the failure of one or more of its suppliers of raw materials  components  peripherals  finished products or software or its providers of facilities  equipment and services to achieve year readiness in their own operations or with respect to the items they supply or otherwise provide to the company 
if such an event were to  or circumstances indicate that one is likely to  occur  the company would seek alternative sources of supply the company periodically reviews its sourcing options as part of its general operating procedures independent of year concerns or seek to develop or obtain a software upgrade to make the affected item year ready 
as with all businesses engaged in some facet of the computer industry  there is a risk that the company s customers may  in advance of or after the change in the millennium  experience year failures or other difficulties in their use of computer systems comprised of or incorporating products or services furnished by the company and may commence legal action or seek other compensation for their resulting losses  such legal actions  even if not ultimately determined adversely to the company  would likely involve significant defense costs to the company  particularly where the combination of products and or services of several different vendors in addition to the company in the subject customer system presents complex issues for isolating the cause of the year problem and determining the vendor responsible for that problem 
disruptions in the economy generally  domestically and or in foreign countries  resulting from year issues could also materially affect the company 
at this time  the company does not believe that the likelihood of any of the above scenarios occurring can be reliably predicted  or that the nature or extent of their possible adverse effects on the company  can be reasonably estimated 
though the company currently does not have formal contingency plans in place to address any particular possible year scenario  the company intends to develop appropriate contingency plans if and when any significant risks relating to its year readiness can be more definitely identified

consolidated product revenues decreased million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal product revenues were negatively impacted by the absence in the current fiscal year of a sale of approximately million to a major domestic retail customer recorded in the third quarter of fiscal additionally  fiscal revenues were negatively impacted by the cancellation  during the third quarter of fiscal  of a million order to a large domestic logistics company 
fiscal product revenues were further negatively impacted by a delay in the recognition of revenue from extended roll outs of company products to customer sites of million 
an additional million in revenue related to goods shipped to customers was delayed due to customer acceptance and product non conformance issues 
finally  revenue for goods shipped of million was deferred due to the company s guarantee of lease payments to third party lessors of company products 
the million or increase in consolidated customer service revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the continued increase in the installed base of the company s products  in turn generating increased maintenance and time and material billings 
consolidated customer service revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the decrease in product revenues for the reasons described above 
the product revenue issues described above did not have an immediate impact on the levels of customer service revenues recorded in fiscal  but may limit service revenue growth in future years 
the company s international operations including canada and international distributors provided revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to the relocation of the company s aironet wireless communication  inc aironet subsidiary  a developer  manufacturer  and marketer of wireless lan systems  canadian operations to akron  ohio during the second and third quarters of fiscal million 
this decrease was offset by a million increase in revenue reported by other foreign company subsidiaries as well as increased sales to foreign distributors 
the strength of the united states dollar against the local  functional currencies of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries negatively impacted international revenues by million or during fiscal as compared to the million or foreign currency impact in fiscal the company anticipates that consolidated total revenues for fiscal will be greater than those experienced in fiscal but below those experienced in fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued vs 
the table below sets forth the consolidated net revenues of the company for fiscal and  without adjustments for the sale of its former itronix corporation itronix subsidiary  which was effective december  as further explained below  after adjusting fiscal revenues to exclude the itronix operations  consolidated revenues from the company s continuing operations increased million or  as compared to fiscal year ended march  increase decrease dollar percentage restated restated product  net   customer service  net    total net revenues    consolidated product revenues from continuing operations increased million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal the reported results of fiscal included million of product revenues recorded by itronix 
the increase in consolidated product revenues was due to a increase in consolidated volume with a reduction in the average selling price per ptc unit 
the increase in consolidated volume was comprised of a increase in non pen based units  reflecting continued growth in customers demand for the company s newer  more sophisticated units  and a increase in pen based unit volume  the result of the company s development and increased market penetration of its more powerful workslate models 
the million or increase in consolidated customer service revenue from continuing operations during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the continued increase in the installed base of the company s products  in turn generating increased maintenance and time material billings 
consolidated customer service revenue  as a percentage of consolidated product revenue  has remained relatively constant  in fiscal vs 
in fiscal  illustrating the correlative relationship between consolidated customer service revenue and consolidated product revenue 
the company s international operations including canada and international distributors provided revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this slight decrease was the result of the million decline in canadian sales caused by the relocation of the aironet s canadian operations to akron  ohio during the second and third quarters of fiscal partially offset by the million of increased revenue reported by the company s other foreign subsidiaries  primarily in the united kingdom and germany  as well as increased sales to foreign distributors

the company also incurred severance charges related to terminated manufacturing personnel of 
million  increased provisions for warranties related to the company s international operations of 
million and provisions for disputed royalties and vendor charges of 
million 
consolidated inventory allowance accounts increased to million at march   from million at march  in addition to the inventory allowance accounts  accrued liabilities totaling million were provided for purchase commitments to outside contract manufacturers for discontinued products 
at march   the inventory allowance accounts were primarily composed of manufacturing purchased components of million  customer service spare parts and used equipment of million and international finished goods inventories of million 
the overall increase in the allowance accounts was due to provisions related to the discontinuance of several of the company s products  including the ptc  ptc  ptc  ptc as well as other products 
the total charges related to the discontinuance of these products were million 
these charges included costs for the net realizable value of related tooling of 
million  reserves for related test and demonstration equipment of million and vendor contract cancellation costs of 
million 
a number of factors arose during the later part of the fiscal year that contributed to the management decision to discontinue these products 
these included the extended length of time the development cycle experienced with these products  customer acceptance issues related to products shipped and more advanced features contained in competing products 
these factors led to a reduction in customer demand and the related backlog for these products 
additionally  the effort needed to be put forth in order to modify the existing products to meet increased customer demands for performance features was determined to be cost prohibitive 
in addition to the amounts noted above  provisions were made for manufacturing components of million  test equipment held by customers of million  remanufactured equipment of million  customer service spare parts and used equipment of million and international finished goods of million 
the provisions for remanufacturing obsolescence were made as revenues related to the company s remanufacturing operations did not materialize as anticipated 
during the fourth quarter of  the company significantly reduced its management emphasis on remanufacturing operations 
provisions for test equipment held by customers were made as such inventory aged and was determined either not to be saleable to such customers or able to be returned and utilized by the company 
during fiscal  the company reduced its shipments of test equipment to customers as a sales tool 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is subject to a high degree of technological change in market and customer demands 
the company therefore continually monitors its inventories for excess and obsolete items based upon a combination of historical usage and forecasted usage of such inventories 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when existing facts and circumstances indicate that the subject inventory will not be utilized 
management disposes of excess and obsolete inventory as necessary and as manpower permits  although there are no formal programs to do so 
during fiscal  the following amounts were scrapped manufacturing purchased components  million  international inventories of finished goods 
million and test equipment held at customers of million 
management plans to scrap the inventory related to discontinued products as soon as practicable 
recoveries related to the disposition of such inventory are expected to be immaterial 
at march   the company had approximately million of finished goods inventory held at customers and distributors and approximately million of manufacturing components at contract manufacturers 
at march   the company had approximately million of finished goods inventory held at distributors and customers and approximately million of manufacturing components at contract manufacturers 
the increase in the amount of inventory held at customers and distributors was due primarily to the increase in amount of inventory shipped to customers but where revenue has not been recognized as installation of the product or ultimate customer acceptance of the products has not occurred 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the amount of test equipment held by customers 
the company accrues fees due its value add distributors for the distribution services and technical support provided to end users as well as cooperative advertising costs 
these fees are generally based upon the sale value of the goods to the end user 
during fiscal  the company incurred million of these fees 
the increase in the fiscal consolidated customer service cost percentage was primarily due to increased internal and contract labor and parts costs associated with repair work performed on the company s more sophisticated products 
it is estimated that these greater direct costs and excess repair costs for warranty repairs were approximately million 
in addition to these costs the company also incurred severance charges related to terminated domestic customer service personnel of 
million 
the company believes that it will realize significant improvements in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the company believes that these improvements will not result in the fiscal gross margin percentage exceeding those experienced in fiscal vs

the increase in notes payable was due to increased financing needs as a result of the net loss incurred during the last half of fiscal  high levels of inventory purchases  and capital expenditures of million  including expenditures related to the company s information systems project 
the increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable was primarily due to amounts recorded for deferred product revenues of million and for costs related to purchases of components related to discontinued products of million as well as decreased payments to vendors 
inventories increased during fiscal primarily due to an million increase of finished goods inventory held by customers and distributors 
the increase in the amount of inventory held at customers and distributors was due primarily to the increase in the amount of inventory shipped to customers but where revenue has not been recognized as installation of the product or ultimate customer acceptance of the products has not occurred 
consolidated inventory turns remained consistent at as of march  and accounts receivable decreased between years primarily due to decreased revenues during the last quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal the overall increases of accounts receivable allowance accounts for bad debts of million and sales returns and allowances of million also contributed to the decrease in accounts receivable 
additionally  the reclassification of million of proceeds in the form of shares related to the sale of virtual vision from other accounts receivable into long term assets when such proceeds were released from escrow added to the decrease in accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding increased from days at march  to days at march  as revenues for the last quarter of fiscal  relative to those recorded in the last quarter of fiscal  decreased at a faster rate than the net accounts receivable balance 
other decreases of million included other accounts receivable and prepaid assets

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has incurred a net loss in fiscal of million with a decrease in consolidated revenues of million as compared to fiscal cash flows used by operations were million  and cash flows used in investing activities were million 
the primarily source of cash flows for fiscal were net borrowings under its credit facilities and including product financing arrangements which aggregated million 
the company is currently in violation of its debt covenants related to these credit facilities and is unable to borrow additional funds against these facilities 
waivers for non compliance have been received through august  the company s stockholders equity and working capital at march  were million and million  respectively 
since joining the company in march  the chief executive officer has formed the company s executive management team and is in the process of implementing the team s operating plan to stabilize the company and pursue growth opportunities in the mobile information systems industry 
management is actively seeking opportunities to generate cash from sources such as inventories and accounts receivable  managing vendor payments and related operating expenditures and is improving operating processes  such as material requirements planning and design to cost  required to achieve its operating and financial goals 
however  there can be no assurance that the cash flows generated from such sources will be sufficient to support the company s efforts to manage the payment of the amounts presently owing to or subsequently incurred with its suppliers 
if cash flows are not sufficient there could be disruption of the flow of necessary materials  components  services or other cash requirements of the company 
in addition  payments may ultimately be required in the near term in settlement of the litigation  commitments and contingencies referenced in note commitments and contingencies 
such payments could have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flows and  in turn  on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in connection with the granting of the waivers discussed above  the company s existing lenders exercised their rights under the terms of their respective loans to file ucc financing statements to perfect the security interests previously conditionally granted in their favor by the company in its accounts receivable  inventory and equipment and the proceeds thereof and subsequently required that the company grant them security interest in substantially all of the company s assets 
the company has been negotiating with financial institutions to provide adequate financial resources to execute the management team s operating plans 
as discussed in note subsequent events to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company has received a commitment letter from a financial institution for a million senior credit facility 
this commitment letter contains conditions precedent and subsequent  therefore  there can be no absolute assurance that this credit facility will ultimately be executed and provide the financing sufficient to fund management s plans 
the planned use of the proceeds from this facility is to repay the existing credit facility in full and to reduce amounts payable to vendors 
the company has received million of the proceeds from the initial public offering of aironet s common stock 
one half of these proceeds are to be used in order to partially repay the company s current borrowings under its existing credit agreement 
the remaining proceeds are to be utilized to reduce amounts payable to vendors 
the company s independent accountants have included a going concern paragraph in their audit report accompanying the fiscal consolidated financial statements 
the paragraph states that the company s operating losses  negative operating cash flows  net retained deficit and debt covenant violations raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern and cautions that the financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
the company is currently meeting cash flow requirements from internally generated cash flows and has successfully managed the payments of vendors and employees without the disruption of the flow of necessary materials  components and services 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to do so in the future 
if the contemplated financing is not obtained prior to august   the company will be required to obtain additional waivers under its current credit facilities 
the lenders thereunder are under no item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued obligation to grant such waivers 
in the absence of any required further waivers  the company will be in default of  and subject to the lenders rights of acceleration under its existing credit agreements and the lenders rights and remedies as secured parties 
pending the establishment of replacement credit facilities  the company will continue to rely upon internally generated cash flows 
management believes that  despite the financial hurdles  liquidity constraints and funding uncertainties going forward  it has a business plan that  if successfully funded and executed  should significantly improve the company s operations and financial results 
the support of the company s vendors  customers  lenders  stockholders and employees will continue to be key to the company s future success

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products to foreign customers through its foreign subsidiaries and changes in interest rates on the company s short term financing and capital lease obligations 
interest rate risk the company s revolving credit agreement and business purpose revolving promissory note carry interest rate risk that is generally related to either the agent bank s prime commercial lending rate  the federal funds rate  the eurodollar rate or the money market rate 
if any of these rates were to change while the company has borrowings under the agreements  the related interest expense would increase or decrease accordingly 
as of march   the company had outstanding million and million under the revolving credit agreement and business purpose revolving promissory note  respectively 
the company s convertible subordinated debentures carry fixed rates of interest and therefore do not pose interest rate risk to the company 
however  interest rate changes would effect the fair market value of the debentures 
at march   the company had million of convertible subordinated debentures outstanding 
the company monitors its interest rate risk  but does not engage in any hedging activities using derivative financial instruments to mitigate such risk 
foreign currency risk the financial results of the company s foreign subsidiaries are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange at the end of each year and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income 
item a
