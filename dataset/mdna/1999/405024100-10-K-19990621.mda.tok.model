the sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  or in the case of a hedge of a forecasted probable transaction  a derivative s gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income until the transaction is consummated 
additionally  a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may implement sfas no 
as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance that is fiscal quarters beginning june  and thereafter 
sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on the company s financial statements or the timing of adoption of sfas no 
have not been determined

the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
year compliance update haemonetics is aware of the potential for industry wide business disruption that could occur due to problems related the year issue 
it is the belief of haemonetics management that the company has a prudent plan in place to address these issues within the company and its supply chain 
the components of its plan include an assessment of internal systems for modification and or replacement  communication with external vendors to determine their state of readiness and their ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of goods and services to haemonetics  an evaluation of equipment sold by haemonetics to customers as to the ability of the equipment to work properly after the turn of the century  an evaluation of production equipment as to its ability to function properly after the turn of the century  an evaluation of facility related issues  the retention of technical and advisory expertise to ensure that prudent action steps are being taken  and the development of a contingency plan 
state of readiness haemonetics has developed a comprehensive plan to reduce the probability of operational difficulties due to year related failures 
while there is still a significant amount of work to do  the company believes that it is on track towards a timely completion 
overall  haemonetics estimates that it has completed the inventory of systems related year exposures and is continually updating an inventory of potential non systems exposures 
the company continues to make progress in remediating known year systems exposures and is addressing exposures which exist in non systems areas such as its supply chain 
the company continues to develop remediation approaches as additional issues are identified 
internal it systems the process haemonetics is following to achieve year compliance for internal it systems is as follows develop an inventory of all it components hardware  software determine the year compliance status of each determine the importance of year compliance for each component implications of failure prioritize non compliant components based on importance determine method to be used to achieved compliance for each component modify  replace  cease use complete the planned action test the component the initial inventory of all it components in use throughout the company has been completed 
the initial assessment of year status for all components has been completed 
fourteen systems  all commercial packages  are used company wide for business transaction processing and accounting 
thirteen of these fourteen systems are year compliant 
the company is on schedule to have the remaining system compliant by june  there are other business applications in use by the company that are less critical 
of these systems are currently year compliant 
through a combination of modification  replacement and decommissioning  year compliance of of the remaining applications is expected by june  compliance of the remaining two applications is expected by july  the company has completed an assessment of its it infrastructure servers  networks  phone systems  system software and plans to have all items remediated  replaced  or decommissioned by june  in addition  the company is in the process of testing critical components of it infrastructure and applications that have been assessed as compliant 
suppliers the company is in the process of communicating with its external vendors of goods and services to gain an understanding of their state of year readiness and their ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply to haemonetics 
the company has sent letters to over  vendors outlining its approach towards the year issue and asking for the vendors commitment to resolve any issues they may have 
they have also been asked to complete a short questionnaire and to inform the company of any known compliance issues 
the company has received many responses to the questionnaire and is in the process of reviewing them 
the company has sent a detailed questionnaire to vendors it views as critical to its business 
a critical vendor is one whose inability to continue to provide goods and services would have a serious adverse impact on the company s ability to produce  deliver  and collect payment for haemonetics goods and or services 
senior management members are coordinating the identification of these vendors for their respective business units 
many of these vendors have been contacted and requested to complete the detailed questionnaire on year the company anticipates contacting the remaining critical vendors as part of its contingency planning process 
haemonetics may also request the right to visit and or audit one or more of these critical vendors to validate their year readiness 
production equipment the company has completed an inventory of production equipment currently used at haemonetics 
the year readiness of this equipment is being determined through communication with the equipment manufacturers and testing where appropriate 
through this inventory and assessment process the company has identified fewer than pieces of equipment with year issues 
all production equipment which has been identified as not year compliant has either been repaired  replaced  or is scheduled for such action 
at this time the company is not aware of any production equipment whose current or anticipated use is affected by the year issue and which is not expected to be made compliant 
in the event that any year issues are identified in the future  it is the company s intention to continue to repair or replace non compliant production equipment prior to operating difficulties  or develop alternative means of operation 
haemonetics remains aware of the potential for imbedded logic within microchips to cause equipment failure 
the company believes that its action plan provides a sound approach towards evaluating production equipment  however  it may be impracticable or impossible to test certain items of production equipment for year readiness 
to the extent such untested equipment is not year ready  it may fail to operate on january   resulting in possible production delays 
facility related issues the company is in the process of completing an inventory and evaluating facilities related equipment such as security  heating  elevator  telephone and other service equipment with the potential for year related failures 
the year readiness of this equipment will be determined through communication with the equipment manufacturers and testing where appropriate 
at this time the company is not aware of any facilities related equipment which is affected by the year issue 
the company s objective is to complete its inventory and evaluation of facilities related equipment in conjunction with its contingency planning program 
the company intends to repair or replace non compliant facilities related equipment prior to operating difficulties 
haemonetics remains aware of the potential for imbedded logic within microchips to cause equipment failure 
the company believes that its action plan provides a thorough approach towards evaluating facilities related equipment  however  it may be impracticable or impossible to test certain items of facilities related equipment for year readiness 
to the extent such untested equipment is not year ready  it may fail to operate on or after january   resulting in possible interruptions of security  heating  elevator  telephone and other services 
technical and advisory expertise haemonetics has engaged a leading professional services and consulting firm experienced in year compliance to assist in project planning  testing methodologies  and evaluating year remediation activities 
this firm will also contribute to the development and documentation of the company s year contingency plan 
haemonetics products the company makes products in two major categories blood processing equipment and the single use disposables that are used in this equipment for each procedure 
the disposables have no date related functions aside from lot numbering and expiry dating printed on the packaging 
the equipment itself does not rely on date related data for its mechanical function 
there is no calendar related logic in the haemonetics software that controls the function of the machine 
the company has undertaken a detailed review of hardware components and software code for the current revisions of all products 
at this time the company is not aware of any issues related to equipment it sells which would prevent its customers from continuing their operations or which would impact the safety of patients or donors in any way 
costs haemonetics is evaluating the total cost of year compliance 
at this time the company estimates that the total cost of completing year related activities will be between million and million 
this amount includes both it and non it related expenses 
of this amount  approximately has already been spent representing of the total it budget during the spending period 
approximately of the spending to date has been on capital investments 
the company anticipates capital expenditures to total between million and million and expense to total million to million 
this amount includes the replacement of hardware and applications that are outdated and were due for replacement regardless of year issues 
contingency plan although the company believes it is taking appropriate action related to the identification and resolution of issues related to the year  its assessment is still in progress 
the company may never know with certainty whether third parties in the company s supply chain are compliant 
failure of such third parties to achieve year compliance could result in delayed deliveries to  or shipments by  the company 
if such delays are extended  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as the company continues to assess the state of readiness within its unique set of business partners  production processes  and internal systems  the company will develop its formal contingency plan in an effort to alleviate high potential or serious failures 
the framework for this contingency plan has been completed and includes a matrix of factors which will permit the company to identify key portions of its supply chain and consider the potential impact of year failures and amount of time the company s operations could be subjected to a potential failure 
the company is integrating the ongoing critical vendor identification and communication process with the development of its contingency plan 
at this time  the company plans to increase its inventory of raw materials and finished goods by increasing purchases and production through the third quarter of the company recognizes the importance of an appropriate contingency plan and is working closely with external consultants in its development 
risks the company continues to evaluate the risks associated with potential year related failures 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its critical vendors 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the company s year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
euro currency effective january   the countries of the european union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  holland  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain adopted a single currency known as the euro 
for the next three years  these countries will be allowed to transact business in both the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
then  on january   the euro will become the only currency for these countries 
although the effect of the conversion on the company s results of operation may be significant  the company is unable to quantify the effect at this time 
the company however  is committed to developing a plan to prepare for the introduction of the euro 
the plan will include preparation procedures for every area of the company expected to be affected by the euro conversion including but not limited to information systems  finance and tax 
this review will also include a plan to assess the company s business and financial systems  to evaluate currency risk and to assess the conversion s impact on the company s financial instruments as well as on the pricing and the distribution of the its products 
the company does not expect the cost of this effort to have a material impact on its business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  the company can not guarantee that all problems will be foreseen and corrected  or that no material disruption of its business will occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk over two thirds of the company s revenues are generated outside the us yet the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
foreign exchange risk arises because the company engages in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency 
accordingly  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakness relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive effect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the majority of its firm sales commitments to customers that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also enters into forward contracts that settle within days to hedge certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
actual gains and losses on all forward contracts are recorded in operations  offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged 
these derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro equivalent of the french franc  deutsche mark and italian lire 
at april   the company had the following significant foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm sales commitments denominated in foreign currency outstanding hedged buy sell weighted forward us unrealized currency local currency contract rate forward rate gain loss maturity euro equivalent    apr jun euro equivalent    jul sep euro equivalent    oct dec euro equivalent    jan mar japanese yen  per us   apr jun japanese yen  per us   jul sep japanese yen  per us   oct dec japanese yen  per us   jan mar the company estimated the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the fair value of all forward contracts would increase by million 
assuming a weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies  the fair value of all forward contracts would decrease by million 
interest rate risk approximately  of the company s long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on the company s interest expense amounts 
the fair value of the company s long term debt however would change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at april  the fair value of the company s long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on the company s financial statements 
this higher fair market is primarily related to the million  fixed rate senior notes the company holds 
these notes represent approximately of the company s outstanding long term borrowings at april  using scenario analysis  the company changed the interest rate on all long term maturities by from the rate levels  which existed at april  the effect was a change in the fair value of the company s long term debt  of approximately million
