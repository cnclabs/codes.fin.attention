item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
background the company is a research based biopharmaceutical  medical device  raw materials and nutraceutical company engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of naturally derived complex carbohydrate and other natural product therapeutics for the treatment of major illnesses  the dressing and management of wounds and nutritional supplements 
the company is comprised of two business segments 
see note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about these business segments 
the company sells  using a network of distributors  prescription and nonprescription human and veterinary products through its wound and skin care division and consumer and bulk raw material products through its consumer products subsidiary  caraloe  inc the company s research and product portfolio are based primarily on complex carbohydrate isolated from the aloe vera l 
plant 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  the company held cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively  a decrease of  net cash provided by operating activities in was  as compared to a cash outflow from operating activities in of  significant cash outflows during included investments in property and equipment of  customers with significant accounts receivable balances at the end of include mannatech  inc  aloe commodities international  inc aci  mckesson general medical  and of these amounts   was collected as of march  the aci balance  which was fully reserved as of december   was converted to a note receivable on february  see note six to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of aci 
as of december   the company had no material capital commitments other than its leases and agreements with suppliers 
in march  the company  with four other investors  formed aloe and herbs international  inc  a panamanian corporation  with the sole intent of acquiring a  acre tract of land in costa rica to be used for the production of aloe vera leaves to be sold to the company at competitive  local market rates 
this would allow the company to save approximately on the per kilogram cost of leaves as compared to the cost of importing leaves from other central and south american countries 
aloe herbs subsequently formed a wholly owned subsidiary  rancho aloe cr  cr  a costa rica corporation  which acquired the land in april the company received  shares of aloe herbs common stock  which represents a ownership position  in exchange for providing expertise in farming aloe plants and providing a cash advance to rancho aloe to be used for the purchase of aloe plants 
this cash advance of  is evidenced by a note receivable payable in installments  with the final payment due in june the company also advanced  to aloe herbs in november for the acquisition of an irrigation system to improve production on the farm and allow harvesting of leaves year round 
this advance was evidenced by a note receivable which is payable in full in may  and the company was also granted a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock of aloe herbs 
the first shipments of leaves from rancho aloe to the company were made in march in the fourth quarter of  the company fully reserved all amounts due from aloe herbs 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with comerica bank texas for a  line of credit  secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
this credit facility will be used for operating needs  as required  and is currently being used to secure the letter of credit described below 
in october  the company completed a  financing involving the private placement of series e convertible preferred stock the series e shares with the intention of using the proceeds from this sale to fund the company s clinical research programs 
due to unfavorable results of the first phase iii trial in the aliminase 
tm 
project and to market conditions creating potential additional dilution to the outstanding shares of common stock  as well as other reasons  the company s board of directors concluded that it was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders that the company repurchase the series e shares  a process it completed in may amounts paid to preferred shareholders in excess of par totaled  more than the embedded deemed dividend recognized in and thus  in the earnings per share calculation in  reduced net income available to common shareholders 
in november  the company signed a licensing agreement with a supplier of calcium alginates and other wound care products 
under the agreement  the company has exclusive marketing rights for ten years to advanced calcium alginate products for north and south america and in the people s republic of china 
under the agreement  the company made an up front payment to the supplier of  in november in july and october  additional payments of  and  respectively  were paid to this supplier upon delivery of the carrasmart 
tm 
hydrocolloid  a new product launched in the third quarter of these payments resulted in increasing other assets of the company 
as of december   the net book value of this agreement was  additional payments totaling  will be made to the supplier as new products are delivered 
in february  the company entered into a supply agreement with its supplier of freeze dried products 
the agreement required that the company establish a letter of credit equal to of the minimum purchase commitment of  but allowed for the amount of the letter of credit to be reduced by of the purchases made under the agreement 
as of december   the letter of credit was  the supplier currently produces the carrasorb 
tm 
m freeze dried gel and the carringtonr aphthous ulcer patch for the company 
both of these products represent new technology and are still in the early phase of marketing 
the company had approximately  of carrasorb 
tm 
m and carringtonr aphthous ulcer patch inventory on hand as of december the supply agreement also requires the company to make minimum monthly purchases of  in february  the supply agreement was amended to allow for unmet monthly minimum purchase requirements to be met by prepayments  to be applied to future purchases under the agreement  which allows the company to keep inventory at levels appropriate for sales demand 
current sales of both items are lower than the minimum purchase requirement  but the company believes that as licensing  acceptance and demand for the new technology increase  demand will exceed the aggregate minimum purchase requirement 
in december  the supplier agreed to add a freeze dried gel product as a listed product under the agreement and to consider an extension of the term of the agreement 
as of march   the company has purchased products totaling approximately  from this supplier 
the company is in full compliance with the agreement and  as of march   has the available resources to meet all future minimum purchase requirements 
the company believes that its available cash resources and expected cash flows from operations will provide the funds necessary to finance its current operations and the current phase iii clinical trial for aliminase 
tm 
however  the company does not expect that its current cash resources will be sufficient to finance future major clinical studies and costs of filing new drug applications necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may have to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements or other means  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funds on satisfactory terms when they are needed 
the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  in  compared with  in sales of consumer nutritional products by caraloe  inc  the company s consumer products subsidiary  increased  from  in to  in this increase in caraloe sales was offset by a decrease in wound care sales of 
total sales of the company s wound and skin care products in were  as compared to  in of the caraloe sales   was related to the sale of bulk manapolr powder 
caraloe currently sells bulk manapolr powder to mannatech under a three year  non exclusive supply and licensing agreement which expires in august sales to mannatech increased from  in to  in in october  caraloe also signed supply and license agreements with one family  inc  allowing one family to purchase manapolr powder and market it in capsule form 
sales under this agreement will commence in in december  caraloe signed supply and license agreements with eventus international  inc  allowing eventus to market a variety of products containing manapolr powder to promote a natural  healthy lifestyle 
estimated sales during the first three years of these agreements are approximately  caraloe also continued to develop its contract manufacturing business during in september  caraloe began to manufacture products on a contract manufacturing basis for skinceuticals  inc  a direct sales company selling skin care products through licensed professionals 
products to be manufactured include gels and creams utilizing formulas developed by skinceuticals 
caraloe also has arrangements to contract manufacture beverage products for deynique cosmetics  gmbh 
the company s wound and skin care products are marketed domestically to hospitals  nursing homes  home health care agencies and acute care providers 
this market has continued to be very competitive and price sensitive as a result of pressures to control health care costs 
in addition  the market is heavily influenced by government reimbursement programs 
the home health care segment of the market in particular experienced significant turmoil in as many of the company s customers either went out of business or postponed buying decisions due to changes in government reimbursement programs 
this had a negative impact on the company s wound care sales to that segment 
nursing homes were also impacted by government regulations in  as government mandated reimbursement changes due to go into effect in january were postponed until the year many nursing home facilities and the dealers who supply them postponed buying decisions and liquidated inventory in anticipation of the regulations taking effect 
in response to the uncertainty in this segment of the market  the company developed its smart outcomes system 
tm 
program  designed to educate nursing home administrators about the regulatory changes and to promote the company s products 
the company also sells its wound care products to international distributors  primarily in italy  australia  singapore  mexico and argentina  with lesser sales to a number of central and south american countries 
total international sales in were  included in this amount were sales of  of wound care products  which was  over sales of the company s oral technology products  which were launched late in  were  in included in this line are products for the management of oral mucositis stomatitis and oral lesions and ulcers 
sales of the company s veterinary products increased from  in to  in these products were marketed on behalf of the company in by farnam companies  inc  a leading marketer of veterinary products 
cost of sales increased from  to  or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from to 
the increase in cost of goods sold was largely attributable to product mix  as sales in of caraloe products were a greater percentage of total sales than in  as compared to  and caraloe products have a higher cost as a percentage of sales than wound care products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  from  or 
selling expenses related to wound care sales in were trimmed by  from the level as the company reduced expenditures in response to the changing market conditions 
partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in caraloe selling and marketing expenses of  this increase primarily represented costs for additional personnel for sales and formulation development in support of caraloe s raw material and contract manufacturing efforts 
research and development r d expenses decreased to  from  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of the completion of the company s preclinical pharmacology studies in early the company continued its efforts in basic research during and discovered a new and unique pectin in the inner gel of aloe vera l 
which has potential near term utility as a product to be used in wound healing 
basic research on this material is ongoing 
included in the total r d activities during were various small clinical trials designed to collect data in support of the company s products  including the reformulation of aliminase 
tm 
the company will return to the clinic with a phase iii trial of aliminase 
tm 
in april beginning in the second quarter of  the company began to make strategic investments into aloe herbs and its subsidiary rancho aloe  an aloe farm close to the company s existing farm in costa rica 
the company obtained a equity interest in the farming venture in return for agreement to provide farming expertise  working capital and aloe vera plants 
the company expects aloe herbs  upon reaching full production  to have the potential of reducing the company s cost of aloe leaves  which is a significant component of the company s cost of sales 
additionally  the company expects that when the farm reaches full production it will provide a supply of leaves to meet the company s growing demand in the raw materials product lines and expected future demand if the company receives fda approval of aliminase 
tm 
further  the company believes this supply will reduce the company s dependence upon leaves from other countries where consistency and quality of supplies are uncertain 
during the second and fourth quarters of the company invested a total of approximately 
million in aloe herbs  generally in the form of notes receivable 
aloe herbs has had difficulty acquiring the additional financing required to complete its business plans and  based upon the review of the financial statements of aloe herbs  the company believes there is substantial doubt regarding aloe herbs ability to remain a going concern without obtaining additional financing 
aloe herbs has substantial capital requirements during and for debt payments  ongoing investments in aloe plants and other general start up costs 
the company has not committed to provide the amount of additional capital aloe herbs requires 
consequently  the company has fully reserved the 
million invested in aloe herbs due to the risk and uncertainty of aloe herb s ability to repay the amounts due the company 
the company continues to believe that strategies to reduce the overall cost of leaves while increasing the supply and quality of leaves for raw materials production are essential 
the company had reserved approximately 
million at december  to cover potential exposures on the approximately million of investments in and notes and accounts receivable from aci 
the company continued to monitor its relationship with aci and gradually increased the reserve over the first three quarters of by approximately 
million 
in the fourth quarter of the company obtained the audited financial statements and the october year to date unaudited financial statements of aci  which indicated a substantial doubt regarding aci s ability to continue as a going concern 
in addition  aci had been unsuccessful in raising capital needed for its operations 
consequently  the company increased the reserves against its investment  and notes and accounts receivable balances related to aci by approximately million to fully reserve all such amounts related to aci 
net interest income of  was realized in  versus  in  with the variance primarily due to the costs associated with the repurchase of the series e preferred stock in provision for income taxes was  in as compared to  in a tax benefit was not recognized in due to the company recording an offsetting deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company had provided a valuation allowance against all deferred tax asset balances at december  and due to uncertainty regarding realization of the asset

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  in  compared with  in this increase of  or  resulted from an increase of  or  in sales of caraloe  inc  the company s consumer products subsidiary  and an increase of  or  in sales of the company s wound and skin care products 
total sales of the company s wound and skin care products in were  as compared to  in new products introduced in accounted for  in wound and skin care sales during caraloe sales to mannatech increased from  to  of the caraloe sales   was related to the sale of bulk manapolr powder 
sales of the company s veterinary products decreased from  to  primarily due to the company s inability to supply acemannan immunostimulant during part of the year 
cost of sales decreased from  to  or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased from  after adjusting for period cost write offs discussed below  to 
the decrease in cost of goods sold was largely attributable to volume related manufacturing efficiencies realized in costa rica due to the increased caraloe manapolr powder sales 
the benefits of these manufacturing efficiencies were partially offset by the lower profit margins earned on manapolr powder as compared to wound care products 
cost of goods sold in included  of additional expenses which consisted of a  inventory valuation decrease on june   as described below  and period costs of  the period costs were related to the annual shutdown of the facility in costa rica for routine maintenance and inventory reduction programs 
as a result of the implementation of programs to reduce operating and production costs  several changes were implemented at the company s costa rica production facility in early this facility produces all of the company s freeze dried aloe vera raw materials 
among these changes were a restructuring of the work force as well as improvements in efficiencies in the manufacturing process 
the implementation of these changes significantly reduced the cost of costa rica production in the second quarter of as a result of these reductions in cost  the actual cost of production under fifo as of june  was approximately lower than the company s standard cost  which was equal to the fifo cost of production at december  and march  the company determined that the standard cost should be reset to the then current actual cost of production 
this reduction in standard fifo cost decreased inventory valuation by  this amount represented the change in the accumulated value of all items in inventory as of june  that were produced in costa rica as well as those finished goods that contain component items produced in costa rica 
this decrease in inventory value was expensed in as a period cost and was included in cost of sales 
s g a expenses increased to  from  or 
partially offsetting the increase was approximately  in one time charges incurred in which were not incurred in these one time charges included approximately  in additional costs related to the launch of three new product types and a one time write off of approximately  of bank and legal charges related to the early retirement of all bank debt in also contributing to the modest size of the increase in sg a expenses were the ongoing benefits received from cost reduction programs put in place in and the restructuring of the sales force  also put in place in  which were continued in r d expenses decreased to  from  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of discontinuing the phase iii clinical program for the testing of aliminase

the company has since reformulated aliminase

into a reconstitutable powder and will return to the clinic with a phase iii in april approximately  of expenses for the clinical program was incurred in net interest income of  was realized in  versus  in  due to having less excess cash to invest resulting from repurchase of the remainder of the series e preferred stock in may provision for income taxes was  in as compared to  in the tax provision on was less than the statutory rate due to the company s ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards

in year issues like many other organizations  the company faces the prospect of what will happen to computers and other microprocessor controlled equipment using two digit data fields when they encounter dates beyond  as they may recognize the of the year as the year this phenomenon  known as the year or yk issue  may impact the company in some manner  although the extent of any impact cannot be fully determined at this time 
the company has undertaken considerable efforts to assess its situation in areas that are determinable at this time 
with respect to information technology systems  the company has historically followed a policy of purchasing or licensing commercially available computer software packages for use in operating its business 
these packages are typically maintained by their developers  and newer releases of the packages are periodically made available to the users of the packages for purchase or license or as part of annual maintenance programs 
the company typically installs these packages with little or no custom modification to the programs contained therein 
accordingly  the company expects to incur little  if any  cost for custom developed software 
the company s primary business application software used in its costa rica facility was found during not to be ready for the year  and the company subsequently acquired a newer release of the software package which is yk ready 
this upgrade will be installed during the first or second quarter of the cost incurred to date to replace or upgrade software packages are approximately  with respect to non information technology systems  the company has initiated efforts to assess its exposure due to the yk impact on the portions of its production and laboratory equipment which are microprocessor controlled 
the company has determined that there are no significant pieces of equipment in its us facilities that are not year ready 
the identified non conforming equipment will be upgraded or replaced at an estimated cost of  and the target date for completing this task is the second quarter of a yk review of the manufacturing and laboratory equipment in the company s costa rica facility should be completed early in the second quarter of remedial action required  if any  would be targeted for completion by the end of the second quarter of with respect to third parties  the company has undertaken to assess the potential impact to its operations of its vendors and customers not being prepared for the year impact on their systems 
the company surveyed all of its vendors from whom the company made purchases totaling  or more in a recent month period 
to date  the company has received responses from approximately of the vendors surveyed  and the majority of vendors responding indicated that they were addressing the issue but were not yet fully ready 
the company made specific oral inquiries of local us utility companies electric  gas  water and telephone  each of which indicated it has made significant strides toward readiness but is not yet fully ready 
because of the material effect that the failure of any one of these utilities  particularly the electric company  to provide service to the company as a result of year unreadiness could have on the company  and because of the uncertain responses that these utility companies have provided  the company cannot provide assurance that its operations will not be materially affected by the year issue  nor can it quantify the impact that a failure of one of these utilities to provide service would cause 
the company has met with representatives of the costa rica utility company providing service to its facility in costa rica  who indicated that the utility s operational equipment  much of which is older analog equipment  has not been tested  but is backed up by redundant manual mechanical systems 
newer digital equipment is being certified as yk compliant as installed 
the company also met with officials of the national bank of costa rica  who presented a detailed plan for yk compliance and testing 
the bank officials indicated that approximately of their systems have been tested and found compliant 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the company is a disruption in power to its manufacturing plants  as discussed above 
as part of its contingency plan for dealing with these material uncertainties  the company has initiated an inventory program designed to have several months of inventory of its core wound care and raw material products on hand by the end of the third quarter of the cost of this inventory program is estimated not to exceed  the company will also be sending a similar survey to its significant customers early in the second quarter of in order to assess their yk readiness 
the disruption in a customer s business due to this issue could also have a negative impact on the company s sales and profitability  although the impact to the company cannot be determined at this time 
the costs of the company s yk remediation programs are being funded with cash flows from operations and are not expected to exceed  excluding inventory buildup 
some of these costs relate solely to the upgrade of existing functionality 
in total  these costs are not expected to be substantially different from the normal recurring costs of systems and equipment upgrades and therefore are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s overall results of operations or cash flows
