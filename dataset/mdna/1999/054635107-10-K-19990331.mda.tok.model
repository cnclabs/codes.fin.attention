forward looking statements include projections and other statements of events that may occur at some point in the future 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as under item business  including  what factors could cause our results to differ significantly from those you might expect 
overview since the company s founding in  axys has devoted most of its resources to research and development programs 
to date  the company s revenues have resulted from its collaborative research programs with pharmaceutical companies as part of its drug discovery business and more recently from sales of chemical compound libraries as part of its advanced technologies division atd combinatorial chemistry business 
the company s collaborative research programs generally contain one or more of the following sources of revenue to the company research support payments which are generally based on the number of researchers axys is committing to a particular program 
these revenues are recorded when earned by the company 
license fees payments generally made when a collaboration agreement is signed 
these revenues are recorded when the agreement is signed 
commitment fees payments made in conjunction with the company s commitment to perform certain funded research 
these revenues are recorded in equal periodic amounts over the course of the research efforts 
milestone payments payments which are based on the company or its partner achieving certain technical or regulatory milestones in the collaboration 
these revenues are recorded upon the achievement of mutually agreed milestones 
royalties upon commercialization of products resulting from a collaboration  the company may earn royalties based on a percentage of the revenue earned by the collaboration partner 
these revenues would be recorded when product sales result from the company s collaborations 
the company s sales of chemical compound libraries contain one or more of the following sources of revenue to the company product sales as chemical compound libraries are shipped to customers of the atd  the company records revenue based on the contracted price per compound 
license fees payments made when compound supply or technology license agreements are signed 
these revenues are recorded when the agreement is signed 
commitment fees payments made in conjunction with the atd s commitment to perform certain obligations under compound supply or technology license agreements 
these revenues are recorded in equal periodic amounts over the course of the relevant agreement 
although not generally a source of revenue  the collaborative research programs occasionally include the sale of stock by the company to the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the research 
these sales may involve the recognition of revenue by the company if they are made at a premium to the prevailing price of the company s common stock at the time of the sale 
in that case  the amount of the premium is recognized as revenue at the time of the stock purchase

as of february the company completed its obligations under this agreement 
with respect to the company s product sales through the atd  the company has several outstanding agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the production of combinatorial chemistry compounds  of which the following are material to the atd pharmacia upjohn  dated march  for the delivery of compounds through december and parke davis pharmaceutical research division of warner lambert company  dated may  for the delivery of compounds over the next three years 
additionally  in december  the company entered into an agreement with rhone polenc rorer for the delivery of compounds through december results of operations years ended december  and events which affected the company s operations on january  the company completed the acquisition of sequana therapeutics  inc sequana  a genomics company of approximately employees based in la jolla  california 
the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of sequana in exchange for common stock of the company 
the discussion below on in process research and development sets out in further detail a description of the research programs at sequana at the date of acquisition 
in general  sequana was a company of similar size and complexity to axys 
sequana s revenues were primarily derived from collaborative research agreements with most of the same components as those described above for axys 
consequently  in comparing the operating results of the company for the periods ended december  and  sequana contributed in large part to the doubling of all of the line items on the statement of operations  except product revenues and cost of goods sold  which were applicable to of axys alone 
in may  the company formed a majority owned subsidiary  xyris corporation xyris  which was established to leverage the company s existing pharmaceutical technology in the agricultural biotechnology market 
the company owns percent of the outstanding stock of xyris as of december   and the remaining percent is owned in part by a third party and by the chief executive officer of xyris 
revenues collaboration and licensing revenues the company s collaboration and licensing revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the acquisition sequana 
if the acquisition had occurred prior to  revenues on a pro forma basis for would have been million  and would have therefore been million lower in collaboration and licensing revenues for the year ended december  were attributable to the material collaborative research agreements with i parke davis for the gene identification program in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  and includes research funding  ii bi for the gene identification program in asthma  and include research funding  iii bms for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in hepatitis c virus infection and include research funding  as well as a licensing fee  iv merck for the development of small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in osteoporosis  and include research funding and the amortization of an up front licensing fee  and v rpr for the development of small molecule therapeutics that inhibit cathepsin s  associated with certain inflammatory diseases  and include a licensing fee 
although some of these agreements were new  revenues decreased when compared to on a pro forma basis because of lower revenues recognized under the following agreements i the end of research funding in july of the p u agreement for the development of inhibitors of factor xa  ii the end of the research phase in november of the bayer agreement to develop inhibitors of the regulatory enzymes tryptase and chymase for the treatment of asthma  iii the termination of the glaxo agreement for the genomics work in the area of type ii diabetes and related conditions  and iv the end of the research phase of the sb agreement in december for the inhibition of intracellular viral proteases 
product revenues the company s product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase was primarily due to the overall increase in compound libraries shipped in  when compared to  in accordance with the terms of the combinatorial chemistry agreements with p u  pd and rpr described above 
cost of goods sold the company s cost of goods sold increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to more compound libraries being shipped in than under the three agreements discussed above 
research and development the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the acquisition of sequana and additional costs associated with the clinical trials of apc  prior to the termination of that program 
if the acquisition of sequana had occurred prior to  research and development expenses would have been million in on a pro forma basis 
the increase on a pro forma basis to million in from million in was due to the increase in clinical trial costs discussed above  as well as the expanded research efforts in drug discovery 
general and administrative the company s general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the sequana acquisition and the planning of our strategic initiative in oncology 
additionally  general and administrative expenses for included all of the expenses of the company s subsidiary  xyris  due to the company s ownership at december  further expansions in general and administrative expenses took place in legal  finance and business development to support the company s expanded research and development efforts 
these increases for were offset in part by the elimination of approximately million of outside service costs  executive management  and other administrative expense from the combining of arris as the company was previously known and sequana 
if the acquisition of sequana had occurred prior to  pro forma basis general and administrative expenses would have been million in the increase  on a pro forma basis to million in from million in was primarily due to one time charges related to the integration of sequana  as well as the other administrative costs discussed above 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development ipr d expense increased to million for the year ended december  due to the company s acquisition of sequana therapeutics on january  that acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the million purchase price was allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their respective estimated fair values 
as a result  million was allocated to acquired ipr d 
the million was expensed as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date because the acquired in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no future alternative uses  and all programs were still in the research phase 
the company s use of the acquired in process technology is to pursue the discovery of the genetic causes of diseases that can be used in the company s drug discovery programs or in the fulfillment of contractual obligations with our collaborators 
the company anticipates that  utilizing the acquired in process technology  it will take many years to determine the genetic causes of certain diseases and then introduce that information into the company s or our collaborators drug discovery programs 
there can be no assurance that the genetic causes of these diseases will be found  that pharmaceutical agents developed using this genetic information can be discovered by the company or our collaborators which can modulate those diseases  that any resulting pharmaceutical agent will be approved for marketing by regulatory authorities  or that any resulting pharmaceutical agent will be commercially successful 
the nature of the acquired ipr d as of the date of the acquisition relates to projects associated with the study of the genetic causes of certain major diseases  the development of software for use principally by the company in the study of genetic causes of diseases  and projects in the field of pharmacogenomics the emerging science of how genetic variation among individuals affects drug safety and efficacy 
the purchased research and development was identified and valued through extensive interviews and discussions with appropriate management and scientific personnel and the analysis of data provided by sequana concerning sequana s development projects  their respective stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
the following discussion outlines in detail the methods axys used in allocating the cost of acquired ipr d 
the determination of the genetic causes of diseases as practiced by sequana included the following four major processes  each of which involve technology risks and uncertainties  with the further risk that the failure to successfully complete any single process can prevent the project from reaching conclusion technology development of laboratory methods for dna sample intake  automated dna sample handling  automated dna sample storage which includes data acquisition and retrieval systems  and robotics systems 
disease identification identification of disease populations  which include inbreeding and background evaluations 
this phase also includes the securing of contracts to obtain dna samples and the tracing of patient information  which encompasses parental background  severity of disease  interviews  and physician participation 
genetic mapping the processing of dna samples including genotyping  the development of proprietary genotype markers  high throughput sequencing  computer based analysis  and candidate gene identification 
gene identification and validation the refinement of genetic mapping to localize the gene to a single area of the genome including exact identification of the genetic sequence data  characterization of the function of the gene  localizing of gene function to certain tissues  and validation of the gene s function through manipulation to either induce or inhibit the creation of the product of the genetic sequence under study 
due to the nature of the scientific efforts required for each process  the earlier phases  particularly the disease identification phase  involve a level of complexity disproportionately greater than their cost or time to complete relative to the other phases 
while programs were at varying stages of completion  all acquired programs were complete in the aggregate 
at the date of the acquisition  sequana had ongoing programs in the following areas asthma the study of the genetic causes of asthma in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim int l gmbh bi sequana had received a milestone payment from bi and was pursuing the discovery of additional genes 
the study of the additional genes had completed the first three processes outlined above 
osteoporosis the study of the genetic causes of osteoporosis in collaboration with corange international  ltd 
corange sequana had completed the first three processes outlined above 
non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm the study of the genetic causes of niddm or also type ii diabetes in collaboration with glaxo wellcome  inc glaxo sequana had completed the first two processes outlined above 
schiz bipolar the study of the genetic causes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder manic depressive illness in collaboration with parke davis parke davis sequana was in middle of the first process outlined above 
obesity this unpartnered program was set up to study the genetic causes of obesity and had completed the four processes outlined above in an animal model 
this program was also leading to early work in the genetic causes of certain visual disorders 
alzheimer s the study of the function of genes identified with alzheimer s disease 
sequana s efforts were focused on phases three and four only  with phase three being completed 
pharmacogenomics a program generally involved in the development of patient data  software tools and processes in the pursuit of pharmacogenomics activities 
due to the nature of this aspect of the technology acquired  it does not lend itself to being defined in the context of the four processes discussed 
the company estimates that sequana was complete with respect to the initial development of this technology 
the company intends to continue the development of this technology beyond the initial scope as defined at the date of the acquisition 
other smaller studies of the genetic causes of other diseases inflammatory bowel disease  type i diabetes  and diseases associated with genetic variations in certain biological signaling processes potassium channels were also underway progressing in varying degrees through the first two processes outlined above 
the value of sequana s projects noted above was determined after estimating the net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the net cash flows were based on the company s estimate of revenue  research and development costs  general and administrative costs and income taxes 
at the acquisition date  the company estimated revenue for the sequana projects acquired would relate largely to research support and milestone payments through the company currently expects that medicines which utilize its proprietary developmental stage technologies will obtain fda approval beginning at various times beginning in through if such medicines are successfully marketed the company will receive a royalty on the product sales 
research support costs were estimated at of revenues in  declining to a stabilized level of of revenues in and beyond 
the general and administrative costs were estimated to be approximately million in and were assumed to grow at annually until  then to stabilize to annual growth thereafter 
the effective tax rate utilized was 
the discount rate used to value sequana s ipr d was 
the discount rate considers the company s weighted average cost of capital of at the date of acquisition and a risk premium to reflect the risk associated with the stage of development the sequana projects 
the estimated cost and time needed to complete sequana s programs at of the date of acquisition was approximately million through subsequent to the date of acquisition  as part of the company s ongoing assessment of allocating resources to projects  the obesity and alzheimers programs were temporarily suspended 
in addition  the partnered programs have had the following changes i glaxo in the niddm program exercised their option for early termination upon sequana s change in control and terminated the research funding in may  ii corange in the osteoporosis program  changed their priorities following roche group s acquisition of corange  and exercised its right to end this program in february  and iii bi in the asthma program  reduced the amount of research support in january  and is currently in discussion with the company about the future of the program 
if the company is unable to find alternative partners for any of these partnered programs  the company will have to further evaluate the future of these programs 
interest income and interest expense interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in average cash and investment balances between the periods  as a result of the acquisition of sequana 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   from in the increase was primarily due to the higher debt balances from the company s two lines of credit and existing leasing arrangements following the acquisition of sequana 
the company has generally used draw downs from its lending arrangements for capital equipment leasehold improvements 
provision for income tax the company incurred a net operating loss in and  accordingly  no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded 
as of december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforward of approximately million 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
equity interest in loss of joint venture equity interest in loss of joint venture increased to million for the year ended december   and was due to the increase in the loss for genos  which was acquired as part of the company s acquisition of sequana 
this amount represents the company s portion of genos loss for based on its percentage ownership 
minority interest minority interest represents another investor s share of a subsidiary s operating income loss  where the company owns to of that subsidiary 
income reported by the company which is attributable to a minority interest increased to  for the year ended december  from none in this amount is the result of the formation of the company s majority owned subsidiary  xyris 
since we reports all of xyris s expenses as our expenses see general and administrative above  this one line allocates a portion of xyris loss to the minority shareholders  and offsets our operating loss 
years ended december  and revenues collaboration and licensing revenues the company s collaboration and licensing revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the company s collaboration and licensing revenues for the year ended december  were attributable to collaborations with p u  amgen  bayer  sb  merck  abbott and bms 
the increase in was primarily due to i the inclusion of a full year of research and development funding support under a collaboration with merck  which commenced in november  to develop small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in osteoporosis  ii additional research funding under a collaboration with pnu for the xa project  which commenced in september  iii the commencement of the collaboration with bms to develop small molecule inhibitors of proteases involved in hepatitis c virus infection  iv the commencement of the collaboration with abbott to transfer to abbott specialized drug discovery technologies for application by abbott in an undisclosed proprietary research program  and v the inclusion of a full year of research and development funding support under a collaboration with sb  which commenced in june  to develop inhibitors using axys proprietary delta technology targeting intracellular viral proteases 
the increases were partially offset by lower revenues recognized under the erythropoietin collaboration with amgen  human growth hormone collaboration with p u and the oral tryptase inhibitor collaboration with bayer  where the funded research portion of these agreements ended during product revenues product revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from none in  primarily from the sale of combinatorial chemistry compounds 
the company first starting shipping small molecule synthetic organic compounds in under an agreement with p u  which commenced in march and extends until december cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased to million for the year ended december   and was primarily due to the costs of producing combinatorial chemistry libraries 
these costs were specifically related to the agreement with p u for the compounds that were shipped during research and development the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to the expansion of the company s research efforts in new and existing programs  the expense of two phase iia clinical trials of apc  and investments in proprietary programs 
general and administrative the company s general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to increased support associated with the company s expanded research and development efforts  and the expansion of the company s facilities and business development activities 
interest income and interest expense interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the increase in average cash balance between the periods  resulting from the receipt of up front fees collected under new collaborations and the collection of revenues from the shipment of compounds under the collaboration with p u 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   from  in the same period in the increase was primarily due to the higher debt balances carried under bank lines of credit 
the company has generally used draw downs from its lending arrangements for capital equipment acquisitions 
provision for income tax the company incurred a net operating loss in and  accordingly  no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded 
as of december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforward of approximately million 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of capital stock  through corporate collaborative research agreements  and sales of combinatorial chemistry compounds 
as of december   the company had realized approximately million of which approximately million was derived from sequana in net proceeds from offerings of its capital stock 
in addition  the company had realized approximately million of which approximately million was derived from sequana since inception from its collaborative research agreements and the sale of compound libraries 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are its cash and investments  which totaled million as of december  the company has two lines of credit under which it had borrowed a total of million under the agreements as of december  the company has no additional borrowing capacity under these agreements 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million on a consolidated basis with sequana  compared to million  which represents arris pharmaceutical corporation only in the same period in the increase was primarily due to the increase in net loss for the year ended december   which was principally due to the combined operating results of arris and sequana and cash used in the acquisition of sequana 
cash used in operating activities is expected to fluctuate from year to year depending  in part  upon the timing and amounts  if any  of cash received from existing and new collaboration agreements and the sale of compound libraries 
the company also used approximately million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment during the year ended december  additional equipment is expected to be acquired or leased in connection with the company s continuing research and development activities 
the company expects that its existing capital resources  including research and development revenues from existing collaborations  will enable the company to maintain current and planned operations for at least two years 
the company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations beyond the end of such period 
the company plans to seek such additional funding through use of various financing mechanisms that may then be available to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new collaborations on acceptable terms or that additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
any additional funds raised by issuing equity securities may result in further dilution to stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  to reduce the scope of or to eliminate one or more of its research or development programs or to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself 
impact of the year the year problem or the yk problem is a problem that may arise at the turn of the century in computers or other equipment that utilizes microprocessor technology 
some computer software programs and computer equipment  as well as other equipment using embedded microprocessors  use two digit date fields rather than four date digit fields that is  in the computer code refers to the year 
as a result  time related functions in such software and equipment may misinterpret dates after january  to refer to the twentieth century rather than the twenty first century that is  could be interpreted as rather than 
this could potentially cause system or equipment shutdowns  failures or miscalculations  resulting in inaccuracies in computer output 
the yk problem is a global problem and has the potential to impact virtually every company to one degree or another  including our company 
the company is addressing the yk problem by reviewing its core information technology systems  including its servers  databases  desktop computers  significant applications whether licensed from third parties or developed internally and significant microprocessor controlled equipment for yk readiness 
because the yk problem potentially affects many other companies  we are also in the process of reviewing the yk readiness of our vendors  service providers and other companies including collaboration partners and customers with whom we have significant business relationships important third parties 
as the company completes these internal and external reviews  the company has been prioritizing the responses it needs to take to address the yk problem  to address the highest priorities first and to develop by the end of the second quarter of such contingency plans as management believes to be prudent 
with respect to the company s core information technology systems and desktop computers  the company expects to have completed its review and to have made any necessary modifications or replacements by the end of the second quarter of with respect to third party software applications  the company expects to complete its review and to replace or upgrade such applications by the end of the third quarter of in this regard  the company is currently in the final stages of replacing its enterprise management information system with a new system that will be yk ready 
with respect to the few software applications the company has developed and licensed to third parties  the company has completed its review of some of these applications and believes them to be yk ready 
the remaining applications are being tested and if determined not to be yk ready  the company expects to provide to upgrades to such applications to make them yk ready by the third quarter of with respect to other internally developed software applications  the company has compiled a list of such applications and has initiated the design of appropriate tests 
the company expects to complete its review and replacement or upgrade of these applications by the end of the second quarter of finally  with respect to other significant microprocessor controlled equipment  the company has identified such equipment and is in the process of testing it 
the company expects to complete its test of such equipment and to have made any necessary upgrades or replacements by the end of the third quarter of the review of the yk readiness of important third parties is in progress and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of following completion  the company expects to assess the nature and extent of the risk from non readiness by such third parties and to either cease doing business with such third parties  locate back up businesses who are yk ready  obtain reasonable assurances of yk readiness  or to implement other appropriate contingency plans  by the end of the total costs associated with the company s yk readiness efforts is estimated to be less than  expenditures to date with respect to the yk problem have not been material and have largely consisted of the time of company personnel 
the company believes that its yk readiness review and the actions it intends to take prior to the end of should result in the absence of significant yk related problems for the company s computer systems  applications and microprocessor controlled equipment 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to complete its review of various systems within the time frames indicated  that the company  will be completely yk ready by the end of or that the company will not encounter yk related problems that could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company cannot guarantee the yk readiness of important third parties and certain business disruptions could occur  such as a financial institution s inability to process checks drawn on bank accounts  to accept deposits or process wire transfers  an important third party s business failure  interruption in deliveries of equipment  supplies and services from important third parties  loss of voice and or data connections  loss of power to electrical facilities  and other business interruptions which cannot be predicted 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yk related problems of important third parties will not have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition
