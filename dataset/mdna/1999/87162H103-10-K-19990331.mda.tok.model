year state of readiness 
the company has a year project plan designed to identify and assess the risks of non compliance associated with its information systems  operations  suppliers  and customers  and to develop and implement remediation and contingency plans to mitigate the risks 
the year project plan consists of the following activities it and non it systems 
complete inventory of all hardware  software  and firmware components 
impact assessment identify and prioritize components that are not year compliant 
develop solution plan determine and prioritize remediation procedures for each non compliant component  including decision to replace or repair 
complete remediation and test systems develop contingency plans third party confirmations obtain written verification from key suppliers that services will not be impacted by year issues 
obtain representations from major customers that their ongoing service requirements as well as accounts payable processes will not be impacted by year issues 
develop contingency plans the year remediation project is being directed by the manager of information systems 
reporting to the manager is a project manager dedicated full time to the project 
the project manager is supported by an assistant assigned full time to the project  as well as coordinators and subject matter experts at each of the company s global development centers 
the manager of information systems provides weekly status reports to the company s senior management team 
the company s internal it and non it issues are minimized by the nature of its service offerings 
as an information technology company  syntel s revenues are driven by the extensive knowledge base of its professional it consultants 
it and non it year issues are principally associated with the compliance of personal computers  servers  communication equipment  and software residing on both individual personal computers and on the servers 
over of the company s it professionals work on site at the client location 
these consultants utilize client provided work stations and software 
of approximately personal computers in operation at the company s global development centers and various branch offices  less than will require replacement 
all other non compliant pcs have been or will be made year compliant by means of a bios upgrade 
all pcs in the cary development center and the troy headquarters have been upgraded and tested for compliance 
all proprietary delivery software as well as internal syntranet and e mail lotus notes applications are year compliant 
the company is currently implementing year compliant  peoplesoft financial and human resources information systems 
the human resource system will be placed into live production in the early part of the second quarter of while the financial information system is on track to be placed into production during the third quarter of the financial information systems in mumbai and chennai  india are fully year compliant 
the following chart summarizes the project status as of march  completed planned completion task at date create yk awareness equipment software inventory critical systems impact assessment develop plan budget  priorities  resources non critical systems impact assessment supplier mailings follow up may customer mailings follow up may remediate non compliant systems aug develop contingency plans aug project closure review sep costs to address year issues 
the company anticipates total remediation costs to be approximately  these costs include amounts necessary to replace or upgrade hardware  replace phone systems  replace data communications equipment  replace non compliant software  and compensation costs of individuals assigned full time to the project 
the replacement of hardware costs will total approximately  software will total approximately  and compensation costs will total approximately  costs to implement new human resource and financial information systems are not considered as year costs as these projects were based on growing business needs independent of year issues  and were not accelerated by year remediation requirements 
the  has been fully reflected in the company s operating plan and forecasts 
the refocusing of resources to the year has not caused any major internal projects to be deferred  however  the completion of projects to automate several internal processes have been slightly delayed 
these delays will not have any material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
major risks of the company s year issues 
the company believes that its greatest potential financial and operational risks are associated with service interruptions from key communication and utility service providers 
to fully assess the extent of this risk  the company has sent questionnaires to all key service providers via certified mail  is following up with secondary mailings  and is reviewing vendor web sites on the internet for confirmation of year compliance 
to date  the company has mailed approximately confirmations to key suppliers and has received approximately responses  including positive confirmation from its largest communications vendor  sprint  as well as adp  the company s payroll processor 
the loss of communication capabilities would have an immediate impact on the company s ability to maintain operations as would the loss of power at any of the company s global development centers 
the occurrence of either situation could cause a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the mumbai  india global development center  the company s largest development center  is supported by a back up power generator which could provide full power to the center indefinitely  in the event of a power failure 
the next greatest potential risk is the potential for lost revenue should the company s customers encounter year issues  forcing a reallocation of resources from existing applications and projects 
to fully assess the extent of this risk  the company is sending questionnaires to the major customers  will explore customer readiness via direct communication by engagement and account executives  and will monitor customer web sites for confirmation of year compliance 
this risk is partially mitigated by several factors  including the company has completed  tested  and delivered year compliance services to five of the projected top customers based on projected revenue for and the company s revenue base is comprised primarily of revenues from fortune companies 
significant year issues by these companies would suggest widespread problems  which in turn would open opportunities to selectively provide additional year remediation services  potentially offsetting revenues lost from the suspension of non year application support and development projects 
the next greatest potential risk is the inability to process payroll  reduced or lost banking capabilities  and lost air travel capabilities 
while loss of these capabilities would not have an immediate impact on the company s ability to maintain normal operations  an extended loss of any of these functions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company receives payroll services from adp automatic data processing and banking services from nbd bank 
as indicated with other key service providers  the company has requested written confirmation of year compliance from these vendors  and will follow up with their account representatives to ensure receipt of confirmation 
year contingency plans 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans 
because the major risks communications and utilities are associated with large  external service providers for which the company has no influence or control  and for which the implementation of substitute processes are not practical  contingency plans are anticipated to consist of migrating activity from vendors for which year compliance has not been confirmed and in shifting work to global development centers for which year compliance for utilities and communications have been confirmed 
in regard to air travel  the company will attempt to reduce the impact from a temporary termination of services by assessing new customer placement requirements for early january  and will suggest an earlier start date to ensure that key placements are not delayed 
the company has implemented a significant program to identify  evaluate  and remediate year issues  however  as the year project continues  additional year issues may be discovered or the company may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations 
in many cases the company must rely on assurances from suppliers that key services will be year compliant 
while the company plans to validate representations wherever possible  it cannot be sure that validations will be adequate  or that if problems are identified  they will be addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner 
even if the company  in a timely manner  completes all of its assessments  implements and tests all remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences or business interruptions to the company 
item a 
market risk s the company is primarily exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency 
foreign currency exchange risk exists as costs are paid in local currency and receipts are provided in us dollars 
this risk is partially mitigated as the company has sufficient capital resources in the local currency to meet immediate requirements 
the company s holdings and positions in market sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material risk 
these exposures are monitored and managed by the company
