item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading cro providing a wide range of integrated product development services on a worldwide basis to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
in addition  and to a lesser extent  covance provides services such as health economics and outcomes for managed care organizations  hospitals and other health care providers and laboratory testing to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services comprise two segments for financial reporting purposes early development services preclinical and phase i clinical  and late stage development services clinical and clinical support services 
covance believes it is one of the largest biopharmaceutical cros  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that is capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to reduce product development time  enabling them to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and thus  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  covance s comprehensive services and broad experience provides clients with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
historically  a majority of covance s net revenues have been earned under contracts which generally range in duration from a few months to two years 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized under either the percentage of completion method of accounting or as services are rendered or products are delivered 
the contracts may contain provisions for renegotiation for cost overruns arising from changes in the scope of work 
renegotiated amounts are included in net revenues when earned and realization is assured 
in some cases  for multi year contracts a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated  with performance based installments payable over the contract duration as milestones are achieved 
covance routinely subcontracts with independent physician investigators in connection with either single or multi site clinical trials 
investigator fees are not reflected in net revenues or expenses since such fees are granted by customers on a pass through basis without risk or reward to covance 
while most contracts are terminable either immediately or upon notice by the client  they typically require payment of expenses to wind down a study  payment of fees earned to date  and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profit that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
covance s cost of revenue includes appropriate amounts necessary to complete the revenue and earnings process  and includes direct labor and related benefit charges  other direct costs and allocable expenses including indirect labor  facility charges and information technology costs 
these costs  as a percentage of net revenues  tend and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another generally within a range of up to basis points in either direction  principally as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time

net revenues from covance s early development segment grew 
cost of revenue increased to million for from million for as a result of the increase in net revenues 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  increased to for from for this increase is primarily attributable to covance s biomanufacturing operations 
during the first eleven months of  all costs incurred in covance s biomanufacturing operations were of an administrative nature as the biomanufacturing facility was being prepared for revenue producing operations which began in december 
once the biomanufacturing operations began generating revenue  many expenses shifted from administrative to cost of revenue 
overall  selling  general and administrative expense  which consists primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  advertising and promotional expenses  administrative travel and allocable expenses facility charges and information technology costs  increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to for from for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues is primarily a result of two factors 
the shift in expenses in covance s biomanufacturing operations  as discussed above  accounts for most of the reduction in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues for compared to second  as a wholly owned business of corning  certain administrative activities were historically performed on covance s behalf by corning 
charges incurred for these services totaled million  or of net revenues  in while these charges are no longer incurred as a result of covance s spin off from corning  they have been substantially  but not entirely  replaced by internal costs as additional resources continue to be added to perform the services previously provided by corning  as well as to perform functions new to covance as a separate publicly traded company 
depreciation and amortization increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for as the growth in these non cash charges outpaced the increase in net revenues 
depreciation and amortization from covance s late stage development and early development segments totaled million and million  respectively 
inclusive of a special non recurring charge in  income from operations increased million to million for from million for during the fourth quarter of  covance recorded a large one time charge totaling million million after tax associated with its spin off from corning 
this charge consisted of the cost to establish and fund two employee stock ownership plans million and the direct expenses incurred to establish covance as a separate publicly traded company million 
excluding the impact of the spin off related charge  income from operations increased million or to million for as compared to million for income from operations from covance s late stage development and early development segments for the year ended december  totaled million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   excluding the impact of the spin off related charge 
other expense net increased million to million for from million for  due to an increase in net interest expense of million  partially offset by a decrease in net foreign exchange transaction losses of million  in as compared to covance s effective tax rate  excluding the special non recurring charge in  decreased to for from for since covance operates on a global basis  its effective tax rate is subject to variation from year to year as the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings changes 
net income increased to million for from million for excluding the after tax impact of the spin off related charge  net income increased million or 
quarterly results covance s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant drug development trials  termination of drug development trials  acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of studies or trials are often the result of actions taken by clients or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by covance 
since a large amount of covance s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  minor variations in the commencement  progress or completion of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results of covance for each of the eight most recent fiscal quarters during the period ended december  in the opinion of covance  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited covance consolidated financial statements and reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for those periods

liquidity and capital resources covance has a centralized domestic cash management function whereby cash received from operations is generally swept daily to a centrally managed concentration account 
cash disbursements for operations are funded as needed from the concentration account 
from time to time excess cash balances are maintained at covance  generally for specific cash requirements 
in november  covance borrowed million under a newly established five year million senior revolving credit facility the credit facility to repay corning and affiliates for all intercompany borrowings and income tax liabilities existing at that time 
at december   there was million of outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in a remaining availability of million under the credit facility 
covance has several different interest rate options available to it under the credit facility 
interest on all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility during was computed based upon the london interbank offered rate plus a margin and approximated per annum 
the credit facility expires in november and contains various covenants which  among other things  may restrict covance from engaging in certain financing activities and prohibits covance from paying cash dividends on the covance common stock during a default or an event of default  as defined in the credit facility  or if after giving effect to the payment of such dividends covance would not be in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility 
at december   covance was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
as of december   covance biotechnology had million in short term debt outstanding with the north carolina biotechnology center 
this debt matures in december and is guaranteed by covance 
in addition  covance biotechnology has a million short term revolving credit facility with a bank  of which million of borrowings were outstanding as of december  this short term revolving credit facility carries interest at a rate substantially equivalent to the rate in effect on covance s borrowings under the credit facility and is guaranteed by covance 
in october  a foreign subsidiary of covance borrowed million swiss francs from a bank 
this loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and matures in october in connection with this loan  covance provided a letter of credit in favor of the lender which may be drawn upon in event of default 
these funds were used to repay certain cross currency intercompany obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
covance s primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible future acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that a combination of borrowings under the credit facility  cash generated from operations and possible future capital market financings will provide covance with sufficient financial flexibility and ready access to cash on both a short term and a long term basis to fund  as required  capital expenditures  potential future acquisitions and other longer term growth opportunities 
during the year ended december   covance s operations provided net cash of million  a decrease of million from the corresponding amount 
cash flows from net earnings adjusted for non cash activity provided million during  up million or from the corresponding amount of million 
the change in net operating assets used million in cash during  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable  while this net change used million in cash during covance s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  investing activities for the years ended december  and included capital spending to expand existing operations and purchase equipment to enhance scientific technology capabilities 
during and  covance spent approximately million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures for maintenance and upgrade of existing equipment  outfitting of new facilities and computer equipment and software for newly hired employees 
investing activities for the year ended december  also included acquisitions 
in the fourth quarter of  covance acquired gdxi  inc and berkeley antibody company  inc for cash payments totaling approximately million 
as discussed in note to the audited covance consolidated financial statements  covance has  and may from time to time in the future  enter into build to suit operating lease arrangements 
these transactions may allow covance to purchase the underlying facility and or equipment or cancel the lease arrangement on various dates over the lease term 
in the event of cancellation  covance may be obligated under residual value guarantee provisions of the leases 
covance has one lease arrangement whereby it has a contingent residual value guarantee payment in the event that covance terminates the lease and the sale of the underlying facility and equipment results in sales proceeds by the lessor in an amount less than the lessor s unamortized investment in the lease arrangement 
under these circumstances  covance s maximum payment would approximate million at the end of the first year of the lease and decreases to approximately million at the end of the tenth year of the lease  assuming covance terminates the lease and the sales proceeds received by the lessor were zero 
foreign currency since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts covance executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular covance subsidiary s local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
while some contracts provide that currency fluctuations from the rates in effect at the time the contract is executed are the responsibility of the customer and others provide that currency fluctuations from the rates in effect at the time the contract is executed up to a specified threshold generally plus or minus a few percentage points are absorbed by covance while fluctuations in excess of the threshold are the customer s responsibility  most contracts do not specifically address responsibility for currency fluctuations 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance s consolidated financial results 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in covance s consolidated statements of income 
finally  covance s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to covance s consolidated financial position 
taxes since covance conducts operations on a global basis  covance s effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance s profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions 
see note to the audited covance consolidated financial statements 
inflation while most of covance s net revenues are earned under contracts  the long term contracts those in excess of one year generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  covance believes that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition 
year issues information systems are an integral part of the services and products covance provides 
covance has formed a group  led by its year project director working in conjunction with a steering committee of executives from covance  to implement covance s year assessment and remediation plan the plan from an internal  supplier and customer perspective 
presently  there are approximately full time employee equivalents who are dedicated to the year project 
this plan is being executed under the guidance of covance s senior management  including the chief executive officer and the board of directors 
specifically  the plan is managed at the operational level by the general manager and group president of each applicable business location 
in addition  each business location undergoes periodic comprehensive management reviews with other executives of covance  including the chief executive officer  the chief financial officer and the general counsel concerning the year readiness of such location 
the board of directors also periodically reviews with covance s management the progress under the plan 
state of readiness 
the plan is intended to provide a comprehensive and rigorous methodology for identifying and addressing the risks of year problems to covance 
its goal is to minimize the number and seriousness of any defects and related disruptions or problems stemming from year issues and to quickly repair any that do occur 
covance s plan has been divided into six phases inventory  risk assessment  evaluation  remediation  validation and implementation 
the inventory is intended to cover all of covance s systems and processes that involve the use of dates irrespective of whether or not the system is deemed year compliant  including computer related hardware  computer related software  internally developed systems  devices  equipment  scientific instrumentation  outsourced services  outsourced products and client systems that covance interacts with 
the inventory phase also involves assessing systems interrelationships to minimize the adverse effects non compliant data or systems could have on remediated systems 
risk assessment involves determining the potential impact to covance s operations because of year non compliance 
specifically  the most business critical systems are prioritized and potential material liabilities identified 
evaluation involves determining whether a system is year compliant 
the inventory  risk assessment and evaluation phases of the plan commenced in october and were substantially completed for internal systems in may in conjunction with the inventory  risk assessment and evaluations phases  covance has undertaken a company wide and operation specific year awareness campaign for purposes of employee awareness and involvement 
covance believes that employee awareness will serve to maximize the completeness of its year inventory and enhance the effectiveness of the plan generally 
also as part of the inventory  assessment and evaluation phases  covance is conducting an assessment of material third party relationships for year compliance 
these third parties include investigational sites  utility companies  telecommunications companies  business specific product suppliers  such as software  animal feed and reagent suppliers or providers  transportation companies  and payroll and benefit services companies 
important vendors  suppliers and service providers are being requested to supply covance with certification that their systems are or in some cases notification that they are not year compliant 
generally  where certification cannot be obtained  or even when certification is obtained but the risk of disruption to covance s business is considered so potentially severe  covance is investigating alternative sources and considering stockpiling supplies to guard against potential shortages 
however  there can be no assurances that covance s suppliers  vendors and service providers will attain year compliance or that suitable alternative suppliers  vendors and service providers can be engaged 
it is possible that delays  increased costs or supplier  vendor or service provider failures could have a material adverse impact on covance s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  by  for example  negatively effecting covance s ability to meet its contractual or regulatory obligations or service its customers 
while covance is taking steps to raise awareness of the year issue among its customers  covance does not believe it is appropriate to require clients to certify their year readiness and compliance 
for the fiscal year ended december   covance had no single customer which accounted for greater than of its net revenues and only one customer which accounted for more than of its net revenues 
however  in the event a significant customer or group of customers were adversely effected by year related problems  covance could experience a reduction of business and revenue and a consequent material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
remediation is defined as the phase of the plan where systems are fixed to maximize year compliance so that they are able to properly calculate dates without interfering with the proper operation of other components of the system 
remediation includes  without limitation  the repair  replacement or removal of non compliant systems 
covance is presently in the process of remediating its systems and will continue to do so  as necessary  for the duration of the plan 
in the validation phase of the plan  remediated systems are required to be tested and the testing to be documented 
in addition  systems deemed compliant in the evaluation phase are required to be documented as are vendor and supplier systems 
the validation phase is scheduled to be substantially completed for business critical systems by march the final phase of the plan is the implementation phase where remediated systems  which have undergone and completed validation  are put into operational use and observed for interaction with other aspects and components of systems that may or may not be related to the year issue to ensure non disruption of essential functions 
this phase is scheduled to be completed for internal business critical systems by august and completed for business critical systems by december costs of year project 
covance has  beginning in early  and expects to continue through the end of the year  to incur costs and make expenditures relating to the year project 
these costs and expenditures can be broadly classified into two categories amounts that will be expensed as incurred internal payroll relating to employees newly hired or redeployed to work on the year project  external consultants and the net book value of non year compliant equipment to be replaced  and amounts that will be capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the associated assets the purchase price of new hardware  software and other equipment acquired to replace existing hardware  software and other equipment that is not year compliant 
covance currently estimates that the costs of internal payroll  external consultants and the net book value of equipment to be replaced amounts that have and will be expensed as incurred will total between million and million over the three year period ending december  of these amounts  a total of million has been incurred and expensed during the year ended december  covance currently estimates that the cost of new hardware  software and other equipment to be acquired in replacement of existing non year compliant hardware  software and other equipment amounts that will be capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets will total between million and million and will primarily be incurred over the two year period ending december  of these amounts  capitalizable expenditures totaling million have been made during the year ended december  the primary source of funds for all costs to be incurred and expenditures to be made is expected to be provided by covance s operating cash flows 
risks of year problems 
worst case scenarios resulting from year problems deemed by covance to be most reasonably likely include the following loss of power and other utility services which could result in disruption to existing and future studies generally  harm to specimens and test samples used in studies and an adverse impact on the health and well being of the animals  inability to obtain timely and sufficient supplies of reagents  lab ware or animal feed  which could result in the inability to perform existing and future laboratory and central laboratory studies and an adverse impact on the health and well being of the animals  computer hardware  software and embedded technology failure which could disrupt covance s equipment  systems and networks resulting in an inability to perform existing and future studies and or an adverse impact on the health and well being of patients  the loss of telecommunications capabilities both voice and data  which could result in an inability for covance to internally communicate or to communicate with  among others  its clients and investigational sites  and the inability of covance s third party investigational sites to become year compliant  which could result in the loss to covance of their services 
any one or more of these or other events could result in business slowdowns or suspensions  subject covance to liability for breach of contract or personal injury and have a material adverse effect on covance s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while deferrals of scheduled information technology projects as a result of the need to remediate year problems are not presently expected to have a material adverse effect on covance s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  in the event the implementation of the plan requires greater expenditures or more qualified employees than presently estimated or qualified information technology workers become more difficult or expensive to attract and retain  certain significant projects may be subject to deferral 
if such deferrals occur  they may have a material adverse effect on covance s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
contingency plans 
covance has developed and is continuing to develop contingency plans for handling these critical areas in the event remediation is unsuccessful 
contingency plans include the utilization of back up generators for power supply  identifying alternative suppliers for reagents  animal feed and other supplies as well as stockpiling significant quantities of such supplies in advance of the year  porting from one long distance carrier to another and utilizing cell phones and call access cards when available  and manning interactive voice response system phones with staff and manually randomizing systems on paper to ensure the continued validity of studies 
contingency plans not yet developed will be developed on a case by case basis and are scheduled to be in place by september contingency plans themselves  however  are subject to variables and uncertainties and therefore there can be no assurance that covance will correctly anticipate the level  impact or duration of non compliance of computer hardware  software  systems or suppliers  vendors or service providers which may supply inaccurate information to covance or otherwise be unable to provide their service or product free of defect or disruption arising from year problems or that its contingency plans will be sufficient to mitigate the impact of non compliance 
thus  there can be no assurance that the year problem  even after giving effect to the implementation of applicable contingency plans  will not materialize and such occurrence could have a material adverse impact on covance s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

new accounting pronouncements in march  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides guidance for the accounting treatment of various costs typically incurred during the development or purchase of computer software for internal use 
sop is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  calendar year for covance 
historically  covance s policy has been to expense internal costs associated with software developed for internal use 
upon adoption of sop in  covance may capitalize certain internal software development costs  which under covance s current policy would have been expensed 
had covance accounted for internal software development costs in in accordance with sop  results of operations  financial position and cash flows would not have been materially different 
in april  the acsec issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up and organization costs  requiring such costs be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  calendar year for covance 
application of sop is not expected to have a material impact on covance s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows
