results of operations 
s 
for the years ended december   and  net earned premium revenues of the company were million  million and million  respectively 
in  the decline in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pools million and a reduction in certain lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile million  private passenger automobile million  commercial package policies million and workers  compensation million  due to tighter underwriting standards  re underwriting and increased competition 
in addition  earned premium revenues were reduced by million for premiums due under retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts written for and prior accident years as the company re estimated the premium due based upon its current estimate of loss ratios for and prior accident years 
in  earned premium revenues declined primarily due to a depopulation of the assigned risk pools million and a reduction in certain commercial lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile million and workers compensation million due to competition  reunderwriting and repricing 
in addition  earned premium revenues were reduced in by million to record premiums due under retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts written for and prior accident years 
the company re estimated the premium due based upon its then current estimate of loss ratios for and prior accident years 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in certain voluntary personal lines  principally private passenger automobile and homeowners 
during the three years ended december   the company earned million  million and million  respectively  in service fee income from its service business 
the decline in service fee income is principally due to the decline in the number of assigned risk contracts acquired by the company  pool depopulation  and its resignation from the nypap 
the company s combined ratios as determined under gaap and sap were as follows years ended december  gaap sap 
s 
the combined ratios of the company increased in  primarily due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net underwriting and other costs 
in addition  the reduction in servicing fees in negatively affected the expense ratios 
included in the company s results for  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years 
during  the company reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims  files  focusing on workers compensation  commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business 
such reviews are part of the company s normal ongoing practice 
particular emphasis during this review was placed on reserves carried for the workers compensation line of business 
as part of the review  substantially all open workers compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and including the company also conducted a comprehensive review of reserves carried for other commercial liability lines of business  in which approximately of the open claim files were reviewed  with a primary focus on accident years to as a result of these reviews  the company revised its assumptions regarding average claims costs and probable ultimate losses and  accordingly  reserves were strengthened by million for workers compensation and million for other commercial liability lines of business 
additionally  during the company reorganized the commercial auto claims department 
as part of this realignment  more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised and reserves were strengthened by million for commercial automobile lines of business 
the reserve strengthening included approximately million for commercial package lines of business and approximately million for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business 
during  the company reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims files  as part of its normal ongoing practice  focusing on the commercial package  general liability and commercial automobile lines of business 
as a result of this review and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses  particularly the through accident years  the company revised its assumptions regarding future increases in average claims severity and reserves were strengthened 
the reserve strengthening included approximately million for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business and approximately million for commercial package lines of business 
beginning in  the company entered into new market segments of the voluntary commercial business  including specialty programs for sanitation trucks  gas stations  fuel oil deliveries and limousines 
initially  the company based its loss ratio estimate upon its experience with similar lines of business  industry statistics and standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  which consider expected loss ratios 
during  claims began to develop unfavorably and the company used such claim development to revise the assumptions that formed the basis of actuarial studies and reserves were increased 
with respect to commercial package lines  general liability claims for business written in through also developed unfavorably 
these claims showed an increased frequency of losses as well as an increase in the time between the date the loss occurred and when the loss was reported compared to prior experience 
general liability claims are susceptible to the emergence of losses over an extended period of time 
for the lines of business discussed above  as well as all other property and casualty lines of business  the company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  statistical analyses and case basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses 
the actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns 
these estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience 
any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses  including those discussed above  is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified 
the reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
the probable effects of current developments  trends and other relevant matters are also considered 
since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control or affected by future conditions  reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  the company s estimates and judgments may be revised 
while the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations  the company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
in management s judgment  information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the company s loss reserves 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis  incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience  and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate 
investment income has decreased by approximately million or in as compared to a decrease of million  or in  and an increase of million or in  primarily as a result of lower invested assets due to a decrease in premiums written and a program to reduce pending claims during and  and higher invested assets resulting from positive cash flows in during  the company had realized capital gains of million principally from gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturities  primarily us treasury notes 
during  the company recorded million in realized capital losses in the normal course of managing its investment strategy 
in  the company realized gains of million on the sale of fixed maturities  primarily us treasury notes 
the combination of other underwriting expenses incurred and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs reflected an increase of approximately million or in  a decrease of million  or in  and an increase of million  or in the increase in was largely the result of expenses relating to the move of the company s executive and administrative offices to brooklyn  new york and higher underwriting costs relating to surveys and audits of insureds records in connection with the company s reunderwriting efforts offset in part by million pension curtailment gain 
the decrease in was primarily the result of lower operating costs  primarily relating to pension and severance benefits for certain employees  and a decrease in the provision for servicing carriers expenses in connection with the nypap  offset by higher systems costs 
the increase in was the result of higher operating costs primarily relating to pension and severance benefits for certain employees coupled with higher systems costs 
impact of inflation the company  as well as the property and casualty insurance industry in general  is affected by inflation 
with respect to losses  the company s claim severity is affected by the impact of inflation on the cost of automobile repair parts  medical costs and lost wages 
the costs of adjusting claims and other underwriting expenses have also been affected by inflationary pressures on salaries and employee benefits 
the company receives rate increases based in part upon its experience as well as the industry s experience 
accordingly  premium increases generally follow the rate of inflation 
year and information technology systems the company  as well as most corporations in general  is affected by the problems associated with information technology systems and their ability to correctly capture and process date specific information in connection with the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the group continues to evaluate its information technology systems to determine the potential impact of the year in  the group began to evaluate its information technology systems and their ability to support future business needs 
the group engaged the services of outside consultants who recommended various solutions that included a new policy management system 
this led to a decision to acquire new policy management and accounting systems 
these systems provide enhanced functionality and improved processing for underwriting  claims  billing  collection  reinsurance  reporting  and accounting and are designed to be year compliant 
throughout and  the group sought the assistance of outside consultants who made further recommendations to ensure compliance  which included upgrades and improvements to desktop computers and local applications 
these recommendations would also result in improved productivity  increased reliability  and expanded functionality 
the groups decision in for system replacement requires the new policy management system to be functional by october since renewals for certain annual policies expiring on or after january  will begin renewing approximately days prior to the policy s effective date 
the new policy management system was successfully migrated into production during for all new and renewal business 
insurance companies need to maintain historical information concerning premiums  claims  and other related policy information for many years 
currently  the historical database for information maintained by the group prior to the migration of the new policy system remains on a non compliant year legacy database 
the group expects to migrate this data to its new policy system during the third quarter of the group had also decided in to replace its accounting system which was installed during the first quarter the group believes the policy management and accounting systems will support the year processing capabilities 
although a significant portion of the group s current systems are year compliant  the group formed a year readiness team to further increase the group s state of readiness 
the team  which meets regularly  is developing a contingency plan to address any actual failures that may occur thereby minimizing any outages in operational functions 
the group expects to complete this plan before the end of the second quarter of the team is also charged with the responsibility of monitoring all material elements of compliance including assessment  hardware  software and application environments  testing  and correction implementation 
the group has made inquiries of third parties with whom it has material relationships as to the year compliance of such third parties 
many of such parties have reported plans to be fully compliant by the end of and most have reported substantial progress at the end of however  at this time the company cannot predict the effect of the year issue on its material third parties or the impact any deficiency in the year readiness of such parties could have on the group 
through december  expenses incurred by the group in connection with the year issue excluding expenses related to the group s acquisition of new systems  which was not motivated by the year concerns did not exceed  based upon current information  the group does not expect that the year issue will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations
