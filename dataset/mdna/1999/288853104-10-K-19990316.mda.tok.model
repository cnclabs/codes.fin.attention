perry ellis international  inc is currently the licensor under license agreements  primarily for various men s wear  boys wear and fragrances

under our management of the brand  we expect to benefit from certain operating efficiencies and to enhance the licensing royalties the perry ellis brand generates 
net income from royalties at perry ellis international  inc grew from fiscal year end december  to december  while operating expenses grew at a rate of primarily as a result of increased advertising 
john henry manhattan acquisition

the increases in net sales in fiscal were slightly offset by declines in net sales of our other branded and private label products

net income 
net income for fiscal was million or of total revenue as compared to million or of total revenue for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we rely primarily upon cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility to finance operations and expansion 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to a usage of cash of million in fiscal and cash provided by operating activities of million in the million increase in fiscal cash flow from operations as compared to fiscal is due primarily to decreases in inventory and accounts receivable levels from year to year in the amount of million and million  respectively  as well as increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million

we have the million senior credit facility with a group of banks 
borrowings are limited under its terms to a borrowing base calculation  which generally restricts the outstanding balances to of eligible receivables plus of eligible inventories  as defined 
interest on borrowings is variable based  at our option  upon either libor plus or the agent bank s prime rate 
the senior credit facility contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth 
in addition  the senior credit facility restricts the payment of dividends 
the senior credit facility is secured by all of our assets and is guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility on january  was million 
the senior credit facility expires in april we are currently in the process of amending the senior credit facility to increase the maximum amount available under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility and to add a million term loan to the facility 
borrowings under the increased facility will be used to finance the john henry manhattan acquisition for which the acquisition price  net of the million deposit we have paid and assuming phillips van heusen acquires the existing dress shirt inventory  will be approximately million 
we have entered into an agreement to sell the dress shirt inventory being acquired in the acquisition with a value currently estimated to be million to phillips van heusen corporation concurrently with this acquisition 
we intend to finance the million acquisition of perry ellis international  inc  with the net proceeds from a rule a offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the remaining net proceeds from the rule a offering will be used to reduce borrowings under the amended senior credit facility 
we also maintain three letter of credit facilities which total million 
each letter of credit is collateralized by the consignment of merchandise in transit under that letter of credit 
indebtedness under these letters of credit bears interest at variable rates approximately equal to the lenders specified base lending rates minus per annum 
as of january   there was million available under these facilities 
one of the facilities expires in july and the other two facilities  aggregating million  have perpetual terms 
capital expenditures  principally associated with the new office and warehouse facility  were million  million and million for fiscal  and respectively 
capital expenditures  including the integration costs for the pending perry ellis international and john henry manhattan acquisitions  for fiscal and are expected to be approximately million and million  respectively 
our products have historically been geared toward lighter weight products generally worn during the spring and summer months  which typically caused a disproportionately higher amount of revenues to be realized during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
the introduction of fall  winter and holiday merchandise has also positively affected the third quarter 
our business is currently more affected by the variations in retail buying patterns than the seasons of the year 
management believes that the combination of the borrowing availability under the amended senior credit facility  the completion of this offering  funds anticipated from changes in working capital and funds anticipated to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation and foreign currency fluctuations we do not believe that inflation has significantly affected our results of operations 
we purchase from foreign suppliers in us dollars 
accordingly  the company  to date  has not been materially adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations

year readiness disclosure background 
the year issue refers to the inability of certain data sensitive computer chips  software and systems to recognize a two digit date field as belonging to the st century 
many computer software programs  as well as certain hardware and equipment containing date sensitive data  were structured to utilize a two digit date field 
accordingly  these programs may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year and later  which could result in a significant system and equipment failures 
this is a significant issue for most if not all companies  with far reaching implications  some of which cannot be anticipated or predicted with any degree of certainty 
we recognize that we must take action to ensure that our operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
we have undertaken a study of our functional application systems to determine their compliance with year issues and  to the extent of noncompliance  the required remediation 
as a result of such study  we believe the majority of our systems are year compliant 
our current distribution software was modified by expanding the date to be century compliant  and all entry forms were modified using a windowing algorithm 
the financial systems account receivables  accounts payables and general ledger were replaced with oracle financial release  under oracle database 
this is year compliant  and enhances our business analysis capabilities 
our edi application is software purchased from ngc  a company in miami lakes  florida 
while we do not own the source code to this software  ngc provided written certification of year compliance 
furthermore  we passed the edi year compliance test from nrf national retail federation 
results of the test can be found at http www 
nrf 
com 
we are ready to change to the new edi documents whenever our customers are ready 
some of our larger customers are already doing transactions with us 
our edi software is also ready to convert any non compliant year edi documents to an internal year compliant transaction 
all of our pbxs or telephone systems are year compliant and were certified and tested by lucent technologies 
the security system equipment year compliant certification could be found under http www 
napcosecurity 
com nsg nsghtml 
the monitoring company security one has provided us a year certification of any date based system 
we completed the required remediation noted above  including testing  by december  however  there are also less significant hardware options which will be remediated during to date  the expense to outsiders incurred by us in order to become year compliant  including computer software costs  have been million and the current additional estimated cost to outsiders to complete such remediation is expected to be million 
such costs  other than software  have been and will continue to be expensed as incurred 
an assessment of the readiness of year compliance of third party entities with which we have relationships  such as our banking institutions  customers  payroll processors and others is ongoing 
we have inquired  or are in the process of inquiring  of the significant aforementioned third party entities as to their readiness with respect to year compliance and to date has received indications that many of them are either compliant or in the process of remediation 
we will continue to monitor these third party entities to determine the impact on our business and the actions we must take  if any  in the event of non compliance by any of these third parties 
our initial assessment of compliance by third party is that there is not a material business risk to us posed by any such noncompliance and  as such  we have not yet developed any related contingency plan
