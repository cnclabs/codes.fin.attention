cost of food and beverages 
cost of food and beverage as a percentage of restaurant and consumer product sales increased to for fiscal compared to for the same period last year 
this increase was due in part to cost increases associated with the company wide rollout of the new menu initiative and slightly higher cheese costs  which were partially offset by modest menu price increases during the year 
in march we entered into a fixed price cheese contract with our cheese supplier for our mozzarella cheese to help minimize our exposure from the volatility in the block cheese market which reached record heights during the summer months

comparable store sales for the fiscal year ended september  increased by  while average weekly sales  which includes sales at comparable stores as well as new restaurants  were above the prior year 
sales levels for our latest variations of new prototype restaurants  of which there were seven open during the fiscal year  were above our company owned restaurant average for the year  partially due to increased sales volumes associated with the honeymoon period following a new restaurant opening 
consumer product sales 
consumer product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales in the food service category increased significantly as sales to hotel chains increased approximately during fiscal the expansion of movie theater programs and a non branded program with a national restaurant chain have contributed to our growth in the food service category 
sales volumes decreased in the fresh refrigerated and wholesale club categories as the competition for shelf space has intensified and the presence of fresh prepared food venues has proliferated over the last several years 
we continued to test several branded and private label products with various movie theater chains  hotel chains and other food service providers

operating weeks were essentially flat compared to last year  as five new full service restaurants opened and eight non chicago bar grill full service restaurants closed in fiscal initial franchise fees totaled  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal cost of food and beverages

excluding this accounting change  depreciation and amortization expense would have been down as a percentage of restaurant and consumer product sales due to sales leverage gains 
special charges 
in fiscal we recorded special charges in the amount of million  consisting of an asset impairment charge of million and restaurant closing costs of  the million asset impairment charge was recorded to reflect a decrease in the carrying value of equipment and improvements at leased properties for two full service pizzeria unochicago bar grill restaurants to their fair market value and resulted from weak operating results and negative cash flow 
the restaurant closure costs represent remaining minimum lease payments of one full service pizzeria unochicago bar grill restaurant which was closed during fiscal operating income 
operating income was million which represents an operating margin of for fiscal for fiscal  operating income was million which represents an operating margin of 
fiscal operating income  exclusive of the special charges  was million which represents an operating margin of 
the improvement in operating income and operating margin in fiscal was primarily due to sales leverage gains in occupancy  depreciation and overhead cost categories

the effective income tax rate decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to the impact of permanent items  which remained consistent in fiscal  being applied against a higher pre tax income amount 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in fiscal we elected to adopt the provisions of sop reporting the costs of start up activities  which requires that pre opening costs be expensed as incurred 
in accordance with sop  the adoption of this principle is reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting and is recognized in the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effect of the change in accounting net of applicable taxes was  or per share on a diluted basis 
liquidity and sources of capital the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fifty three weeks ended october  in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities  net cash used in financing activities  decrease in cash  historically  we have leased most of our restaurant locations and pursued a strategy of controlled growth  financing our expansion principally from operating cash flow  public equity offerings  the sale of senior  unsecured notes  and revolving lines of credit 
during the fifty three weeks ended october   our investment in property  equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
in fiscal  we opened five restaurants in our existing markets 
in fiscal  we currently expect to open approximately to restaurants 
we project that the average cash investment required in fiscal to open a full service pizzeria unochicago bar and grill restaurant  excluding land and pre opening costs  will be approximately million 
the expected capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to be approximately million of which approximately million is expected to be expended for the opening of new restaurants 
as of october   we had outstanding indebtedness of million under our million credit facility   in capital lease obligations and million under our mortgage financing 
advances under the revolving credit facility will accrue interest at the lender s prime rate plus basis points  or alternatively  basis points above libor  depending upon our level of indebtedness 
we anticipate using the revolving credit facility in the future for the development of additional restaurants and for working capital 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock through a dutch auction tender offer 
the terms of the tender offer provided that we would purchase up to  shares subject to increase under certain circumstances of our common stock at prices  not in excess of nor less than per share  specified by tendering stockholders 
on october   we completed the repurchase of  shares at a price of per share 
the total number of shares purchased represented approximately of the shares outstanding at the time 
we used a portion of our million credit facility to purchase the shares tendered 
on april   the board of directors extended the previous  share repurchase program announced on april   for an additional twelve months 
to date under this authorization  we have repurchased  shares  of which  have been purchased during fiscal on september  we filed a registration statement for a proposed public offering of  shares of common stock with the securities and exchange commission 
the proposed public offering included  company shares and  shares from an existing shareholder 
on november  we withdrew the offering due to overall market volatility and the current share price of our common stock 
we believe that existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we are currently obligated under leases  including leases for company owned restaurants  two leases for our executive offices and one lease for a mill shop 
we are currently negotiating the renewal of a lease for an office building containing one of our restaurants and continue to pay rent on a tenancy at will basis in the interim 
year compliance the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our programs that have time sensitive software may recognize the date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failures or miscalculations using existing software 
we completed an assessment of our computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and developed and implemented a compliance plan to resolve any issues 
we have executed our current plan and believe that we are fully year compliant 
however  if unanticipated problems arise from systems or equipment  there could be material adverse effects on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the assessment of in house computer systems  we have assessed the readiness of our vendors  franchise partners and non information technology equipment for the year issue 
in terms of our most critical needs  we have received assurances from our major food distributor and our credit card processor that their systems are year compliant 
we distributed questionnaires to our other business critical vendors and franchise partners to assess their year readiness 
we have received assurances from all of our key relationships that they are year compliant 
we have determined that the most likely worst case scenario would be our inability to acquire food supplies from our food service distributors 
we have made arrangements to have adequate inventory on hand to provide service until an alternative source of supplies becomes available 
we believe our operations will not be significantly disrupted if other third parties with whom we have relationships are not year compliant 
we believe that we will not have any material liability to third parties as a result of any potential noncompliance with year issues 
contingency plans have been developed in the event that there are interruptions critical to our on going restaurant operations due to the year issue 
these plans include  but are not limited to  having adequate inventory on hand to provide service until alternative sources become available  and replacing certain electronic applications with manual processes to provide basic restaurant services 
no contingency plans have been developed for the loss of key public services  including gas and electric utilities 
we have expensed all maintenance and modification costs as we incurred them 
we have capitalized and depreciated the cost of new software  if material  over its expected useful life 
we incurred costs of approximately  in testing and remediation of all our systems and applications 
approximately  of the total cost of testing and remediation relates to repair issues and the remainder to replacement of equipment 
all costs were budgeted and funded by cash flows from operations 
no information technology projects were deferred due to year compliance efforts 
we did not purse independent verification of our systems because we believe that any effort would be as costly as the remediation effort and was not warranted 
the costs related to the year compliance project was not material to our financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation has not been a major factor in our business for the last several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in local area construction costs could adversely affect our ability to expand 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature  with revenues and  to a greater degree  operating income being lower in the first and second fiscal quarters than in other quarters 
our seasonal business pattern is due to our concentration of restaurants in the northeast  and the resulting lower winter volumes

actual results might differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the company s ability to open new restaurants and operate new and existing restaurants profitably  which will depend upon a number of factors including the availability of suitable sites  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms  the securing of required governmental permits and approvals  the hiring  training and retaining of skilled management  and the availability of adequate financing  changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  especially economic conditions in the areas in which the company s restaurants are concentrated  increasingly intense competition in the restaurant industry  changes in consumer tastes and eating habits  increases in food  labor  employee benefits and similar costs  and other risks identified from time to time in the company s periodic reports and the more detailed factors discussed in the company s registration statement on form s reg
