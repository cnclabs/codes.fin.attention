effective tax rate adjusted for a two for one stock split effective july  the majority of the growth from to in as reported net revenue and operating expenses was due to the additional revenue and expenses associated with the operations of universal and more group during and the inclusion of the full year s operations of eller and paxson 
the acquisition of universal and more group added approximately  and  display faces  including joint ventures  and contributed of net revenue 
on a pro forma basis  net revenue increased due to improved advertising rates in our broadcasting segment and improved occupancy and increased advertising rates within our outdoor segment 
pro forma operating expenses increased primarily from the incremental selling costs related to the additional revenues 
the predominant reasons for the increase from to in as reported net revenue and operating expenses are two fold 
first  revenue and expenses increased due to the inclusion of operations of eller  an outdoor media company acquired in april of this new outdoor segment  including subsequent acquisitions and license management agreements of approximately  display faces  contributed of our revenue and of our operating expenses during second  net revenue and operating expense increased from the acquisition of paxson during  and a full year of operations for the acquisitions of us radio and radio equity partners  both acquired during on a pro forma basis  net revenue increased due to increases in rates charged to advertisers primarily related to an increase in overall ratings  especially in our houston  austin  tampa and miami markets 
pro forma operating expenses increased primarily from increased selling and promotional expenses associated with the increase in revenue 
in addition to the above mentioned acquisitions  as reported and pro forma net revenue and operating expense increased during  and due to the inclusion of the operations of the following list of broadcasting and outdoor assets  which we acquired since january   the effects of which  individually and in the aggregate  were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations broadcasting outdoor radio television operations began stations markets stations markets displays markets th quarter rd quarter  a nd quarter st quarter  th quarter rd quarter  nd quarter st quarter n a n a th quarter n a n a rd quarter b n a n a nd quarter n a n a st quarter n a n a a includes  shelters acquired in france through the acquisition of sirocco 
b we acquired an interest in these stations 
the tangible and intangible assets associated with the above mentioned business acquisitions account for the majority of the increase in the as reported depreciation and amortization for over interest expense increased during as a result of greater average borrowing levels as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions  but was partially offset by lower average borrowing rates  in versus in our average borrowing rate was lowered in as a result of the issuance of senior convertible notes dated april  other income rose due to realized gains on the sale of available for sale marketable securities and was offset by charges related to the purchase of certain subsidiary options and losses on sale of assets 
income tax expense increased primarily from the increase in the average effective tax rate from in to in the effective tax rate increased as a result of the increase in nondeductible amortization expense principally associated with the acquisition of universal 
the majority of the increase in net income was primarily due to the inclusion of operations resulting from the aforementioned business acquisitions  partially offset by an increase in corporate related expenses 
the tangible and intangible assets acquired through the purchases of eller and the above mentioned broadcasting assets account for the majority of the increase in depreciation and amortization for over interest expense increased for as a result of greater average borrowing levels and higher average borrowing rates  in versus in other income increased primarily from the sale of  shares of common stock in heftel broadcasting resulting in a million pretax gain 
income tax expense increased because of the increase in taxable earnings as well as an increase in the average effective tax rate from in to in the effective tax rate increased as a result of the increase in nondeductible amortization expense principally associated with the acquisition of eller 
equity in earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates increased in over due to the inclusion of several investments held by more group  which are accounted for under the equity method and the inclusion of a partial month of more group s operations  which was accounted for under the equity method prior to consolidation 
this was partially offset by the transfer of our investment in american tower corporation  which merged with american tower systems  inc in june  the result of which diluted our investment from to 
prospectively  we have accounted for this investment using the cost method 
the remainder of the increase in equity in earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates was due to the continued solid financial performance by heftel broadcasting  of which we own a equity interest 
equity in earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates increased in over due partially to the purchase in july of a interest in american tower corporation  a digital transmission tower 
the majority of the increase in equity in earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates was due to the solid financial performance by heftel broadcasting  partially offset by the eroding currency valuation in australia and new zealand 
equity in earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in results of operations for our broadcasting segment

the majority of the increase in pro forma net revenue and operating expenses is due to increased advertising and occupancy rates in pro forma depreciation and amortization increased in part due to the depreciation expenses associated with increased capital expenditures within the outdoor segment 
the outdoor segment s capital expenditures were million during  vs 
million in vs

pending transactions in october  we entered into a definitive agreement to merge with jacor communications  inc the merger is structured as a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
upon consummation of the merger  each outstanding share of jacor common stock will be exchanged for shares of our common stock 
the exchange ratio is based on the average closing price of our common stock during the consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the merger date as follows average closing price of clear channel s common stock conversion ratio less than or equal to above but less than or equal to to above but less than if the average closing price is or more  the conversion ratio will be calculated as the quotient obtained by dividing a plus the product of 
and the amount by which the average closing price exceeds  by b the average closing price

we believe that cash flow from operations as well as the proceeds from our securities offerings made from time to time will be sufficient to make all required future interest and principal payments on our credit facility  senior convertible notes and bonds  and will be sufficient to fund all anticipated capital expenditures 
other the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented 
capital expenditures capital expenditures of million and million during and  respectively  included the following in millions broadcasting outdoor land and buildings broadcasting and other equipment display structures and other equipment the increase in our capital outlays in of broadcasting and other equipment in the broadcasting segment was due to the increase in the number of radio stations owned in versus the increase in display structures and other equipment in the outdoor segment was due to the increase in display faces and bus shelters owned and operated in resulting from the acquisition of universal and more group 
the majority of these new display faces will provide additional or enhanced revenue opportunities 
we anticipate funding capital outlays with cash generated from operations 
we anticipate funding any subsequent broadcasting or outdoor acquisitions with the credit facility and cash flow generated from operations 
other accounting pronouncements as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
reporting comprehensive income 
statement establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components  however  the adoption of this statement had no impact on our net income or shareholders equity 
statement requires unrealized gains or losses on our available for sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments  which prior to adoption were reported separately in shareholders equity  to be included in comprehensive income 
as of january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
statement establishes new rules for reporting information about operating segments  however  the adoption of this statement had no impact on our net income or shareholder s equity 
statement requires us to provide descriptive information about its operating segments as opposed to just reporting financial information 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this new statement will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe it has offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations in our broadcasting  outdoor and corporate locations which could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to produce broadcast signals  process financial transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on recent system evaluations  surveys  and on site inventories  we determined that we would be required to modify or replace portions of our software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  we presently believe that with modifications or replacements of existing software and certain hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed in time  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
the year issue involves the identification and assessment of the existing problem  plan of remediation  as well as a testing and implementation plan 
to date  we have substantially completed the identification and assessment process  with the following significant financial and operational components identified as being affected by the year issue o computer hardware running critical financial and operational software that is not capable of recognizing a four digit code for the applicable year 
o our advertising inventory management software responsible for managing  scheduling and billing customer s broadcasting and outdoor advertising purchases 
o broadcasting studio equipment and software necessary to deliver radio and television programming 
o corporate financial accounting and information system software 
o significant non technical systems and equipment that may contain microcontrollers which are not year compliant 
we have instituted the following remediation plan to address the year issues a computer hardware replacement plan for computers running essential broadcast  operational and financial software applications with year compatible computers has been instituted 
as of december  approximately of all essential computers related to broadcast or studio equipment are year compatible 
approximately of all essential financial based computers are year compliant 
we anticipate this replacement plan to be complete by the end of the third quarter in software upgrades or replacement with advertising inventory management software which is year compliant have been planned  are in process  or have been completed as of december  we have received assurances from our software vendors  with a few minor exceptions  that supply our advertising inventory management software that their software is year compliant 
for these non compliant vendors  we will install inventory management software from a compliant vendor by the end of the third quarter of approximately of the broadcasting properties have year compliant advertising inventory management software as of december  all of the outdoor advertising inventory management software is currently being upgraded and is targeted for year compliance at the end of the second quarter of we have received assurances from our software vendors that supply broadcasting digital automation systems that the software used by us is currently compliant or has upgrades currently available that are compliant 
broadcast software and studio equipment is considered to be compliant as of december  and is anticipated to be compliant by the third quarter of financial accounting software for the broadcasting segment has been replaced and is year compliant 
financial accounting software for the outdoor segment has been upgraded to be year compliant 
while we believe our efforts will provide reasonable assurance that material disruptions will not occur due to internal failure  the possibility of interruption still exists 
we are currently querying other significant vendors that do not share information systems with us external agents 
to date  we are not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact our results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  we have no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact us 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
in the ordinary course of business  we have acquired or plan to acquire a significant amount of year compliant hardware and software 
these purchases are part of specific operational and financial system enhancements with completion dates during and early that were planned without specific regard to the year issue 
these system enhancements resolve many year problems and have not been delayed as a result of any additional efforts addressing the year issue 
accordingly  these costs have not been included as part of the costs of year remediation 
however  there are several hardware and software expenditures that have been or will be incurred to specifically remediate year non compliance 
incremental hardware and software costs that we have attributed to the year issue are estimated at  plus or minus 
the majority of these expenditures will be incurred over the next months 
of this cost  approximately will be expensed as modification or upgrade costs with the remaining costs being capitalized as new hardware or software 
as of december   approximately  has been charged to expense and  capitalized as a result of expenditures 
sources of funds for these expenditures will be supplied through cash flow generated from operations and or available borrowings from our credit facility 
our accounting policy is to expense costs incurred due to maintenance  modification or upgrade costs and to capitalize the cost of new hardware and software 
we believe we have an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  we have not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that we do not complete any additional phases  it could experience disruptions in its operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to produce broadcast signals  process financial transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from the year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
we could be subject to litigation for computer systems failures  equipment shutdowns or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we currently have no contingency plans in place in the event we do not complete all phases of the year program 
we plan to evaluate the status of completion in april and determine whether such contingency plans are necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense would have changed by million and that the company s net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the company currently hedges a portion of its outstanding debt with interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest at rates from to on billion of its current borrowings 
these agreements expire from may to january the fair value of these agreements at december  and settlements of interest during were not material 
equity price risk the carrying value of the company s available for sale equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million 
foreign currency as a result of the august  acquisition of more group plc  more group  the company now has operations in countries throughout europe and asia 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company has operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of currency fluctuations throughout europe and asia to the british pound  the company has a natural hedge through borrowings in some other currencies 
this hedge position is reviewed monthly 
the company maintains no other derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations reported a loss of million for the six months ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the british pound would change net income for the year ended december  by million 
the company s earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of its investments in australia  new zealand and mexico  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change the company s net income by million 
the company s analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities
