historically  the company s first two quarters produced the least amount of deliveries for the year and the fourth quarter produced the most deliveries for the year  sometimes in excess of 
the company s management has made a concerted effort to change this trend using new management tools to focus on delivery evenness and through a new quarterly bonus incentive plan 
the percentage distribution of deliveries for the last three years is as follows quarter ended january april july october total total revenues compared to the same prior period  revenues increased decreased as follows year ended october october october dollars in thousands homebuilding sale of homes    land sales and other revenues    financial services  investment properties    collateralized mortgage financing  total change    percent change homebuilding compared to the same prior period  housing revenues increased million or for the year ended october   after decreasing million or for the year ended october   and increasing million or for the year ended october  housing revenues are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession have been transferred to the buyer

the increase in the number of homes delivered during the year ended october  is primarily due to the increased deliveries in the northeast region  california and virginia which was partially offset by decreased sales in florida 
the increase in the northeast was due to the timing of deliveries in fiscal and the company s desire to even out deliveries over the four quarters of fiscal in california  deliveries increased due to the opening of additional communities 
in virginia  deliveries increased due to the acquisition of a small home developer on may  in florida  deliveries declined since the company cut back its operations due to a highly competitive market 
the increased average sales prices are primarily the result of diversifying the company s product mix in the northeast region to include more detached single family homes and larger townhouses with garages designed for the move up buyer and the sale of more decorator and structural options 
in florida  average sales prices increased as a result of fewer communities  all of which are higher priced single family developments 
in virginia  average sales prices increased because there was a higher percentage of single family detached homes delivered 
in north carolina  average sales prices did not show a significant change 
in california  sales prices decreased due to a change in product mix to smaller  less expensive homes

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these writedowns and writeoffs were incurred primarily because of lower property values due to economic downturns  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property  or the decision not to exercise an option 
during the year ended october   the company has written down one florida residential community and one new jersey parcel of land for sale 
in the florida residential community  higher discounts are being offered to speed up sales 
at the new jersey land site  lots are being contracted at prices lower than anticipated 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss in accordance with fas the company has also written off three new jersey residential land options including approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs amounting to million 
the company did not exercise these options because of changes in local market conditions and difficulties in obtaining government approvals 
during the year ended october   the company had written down certain residential communities  and written off certain residential land options including approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs 
in florida  the company s return on investment was unsatisfactory 
a a result  the company established a goal to reduce its investment in florida by million 
to do so on an accelerated basis  it reduced prices and offered pricing concessions in all florida residential communities 
the company also decided to sell all inactive properties in florida 
in the northeast region  the company changed the product type to be constructed on a parcel of land it owns 
in an active community in the northeast region  the company incurred unforeseen development costs 
also in the northeast  the company decided to sell an optioned property instead of developing it 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in fair values below carrying amounts and  in accordance with fas  the company recorded an impairment loss on the related inventories 
at october   residential inventories were reduced million to reduce such inventories to estimated fair value 
the northeast region also wrote off costs associated with three optioned properties and related approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs amounting to million 
in two cases  the company decided not to exercise the option due to environmental problems 
the third option was not exercised because the community s proforma profitability did not produce an adequate return on investment commensurate with the risk 
the writedowns of residential inventories during the year ended october  were primarily attributable to one community in new jersey  a parcel of land in florida and one community and a parcel of land in virginia 
in new jersey  the writedown was due to the change in use of a parcel of land from residential to commercial 
in florida  a parcel of idle land was written down due to a decline in land values 
in virginia  the writedown was primarily due to reduced sales prices in one community 
also in virginia  a reserve was recorded against a parcel of land which the company was attempting to liquidate through lot sales 
cost of sales includes expenses for housing and land and lot sales 
a breakout of such expenses for housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended october october october dollars in thousands sale of homes    cost of sales    housing gross margin    gross margin percentage cost of sales expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues are presented below year ended october october october dollars in thousands sale of homes cost of sales housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales gross margin the company sells a variety of home types in various local communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
during the year ended october   the company s gross margin increased from the previous year 
this can be attributed to higher gross margins being achieved in each of the company s markets except florida 
higher gross margins are primarily attributed to positive effects from process redesign and quality programs that reduced the housing and land development costs  selective price increases or reduced selling incentives in the company s stronger markets  and an increased percentage of deliveries from the better performing communities 
in addition  gross margin percentages are higher in the northeast region compared to the company s other markets 
in  the gross margin benefited from a higher percentage of housing revenues from the northeast region amounting to in fiscal compared to in fiscal during the year ended october   gross margins decreased in all the company s markets compared to the prior year 
this decline was primarily caused by higher housing  land and development costs and commission expenses 
of the increase was the result of unforeseen development costs in one community in the northeast region 
the balance of the increase in housing  land and development costs was due to a higher number of communities not obtaining acceptable housing  land and development cost performance 
the increase in commissions was the result of more co broker sales and sales associate incentives to increase sales 
selling and general administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october  which had increased from for the year ended october  the percentage decrease during the year ended october  is due to increased deliveries 
the percentage increase during the year ended october  was due to increased costs while home deliveries declined 
such expenses increased million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively  from the previous year 
the dollar increase is due primarily to increased salary and bonus administration costs in and increased advertising and sales center operations in land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales  interest income  contract deposit forfeitures  cash discounts  national contract rebates  and corporate owned life insurance benefits 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended october october october in thousands land and lot sales    cost of sales    land and lot sales gross margin   land and lot sales are incidental to the company s residential housing operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from the company s homebuyers  as well as from third parties  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the year ended october  financial services provided a million pretax profit  up from break even the prior year and up from a pretax profit of 
million in in the market areas served by the company s wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of the company s non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october     respectively 
the company s mortgage banking goals are to improve profitability by increasing the capture rate of its homebuyers and expanding its business to include originations from unrelated mortgages 
the company has initiated efforts to originate mortgages from unrelated third parties and expects these third party loans to increase as a percentage of the company s total loan volume over the next few years 
during the year ended october   third party loans amounted to of total mortgage closings 
most servicing rights on new mortgages originated by the company will be sold as the loans are closed 
investment properties investment properties consist of rental properties  property management  and gains or losses from sale of such property 
see capital resources and liquidity for information on the company s decision to sell its investment properties 
the company plans to liquidate all properties except for its senior rentals 
at october   all properties had been liquidated except various parcels of land 
these parcels are under contract and are expected to close during during the year ended october  one of these contracted parcels was written down million due to increased land development costs 
during the years ended october  and  investment property revenues included a million pretax gain and a million pretax gain  respectively  from the sale of its commercial facilities and land 
investment properties expenses do not include interest expense see interest below 
collateralized mortgage financing in the years prior to february  the company pledged mortgage loans originated by its mortgage banking subsidiaries against collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
subsequently  the company discontinued its cmo program 
as a result  cmo operations are diminishing as pledged loans are decreasing through principal amortization and loan payoffs  and related bonds are reduced 
in recent years  as a result of bonds becoming callable  the company has also sold a portion of its cmo pledged mortgages 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses includes the operations at the company s headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
in  the increase was primarily attributed to increased bonus accruals there were no bonus accruals based on the return on equity incentive program in  increased depreciation from the amortization of capitalized process redesign costs in prior years and increased expenditures for long term improvement initiatives 
the company s long term improvement initiatives include total quality  process redesign net of capitalized expenses  and training 
such initiatives resulted in additional expenses for the years ended october    and amounting to million  million  and million  respectively 
interest interest expense includes housing  land and lot  and rental properties interest 
interest expense is broken down as follows year ended october october october in thousands sale of homes    land and lot sales rental properties    total    housing interest as a percentage of sale of home revenues amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage for the year ended october  was primarily due to decreased levels of debt during the year compared to this decrease was the result of the company delivering a more even flow of homes during the increase in the percentage for the year ended october  was primarily the result of the company discontinuing the capitalization of interest on communities in planning which were not under active development 
as a result  interest expense increased approximately million for the year ended october  other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations  amortization of subordinated note issuance expenses  and corporate owned life insurance loan interest 
total taxes total taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes amounted to and for the years ended october  and  respectively 
net tax benefits as a percentage of the loss before income taxes amounted to for the year ended october  deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
extraordinary loss in october  the company redeemed  of its outstanding subordinated notes due at an average price of of par which resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of year issues the company has assessed and formulated a plan to resolve its information technology it and non it system year issues 
the company has designated a full time year project leader  engaged consultants to review and evaluate its plan  completed the identification of company it and non it noncompliant systems and is in the process of evaluating subcontractors and suppliers state of readiness 
the company s plan has prioritized its efforts on its software systems and computer hardware equipment 
the company has upgraded  fixed or retired of its noncompliant systems 
the company expects to have substantially all critical it software year capable and tested by june  all other company it and non it systems are not considered critical to company operations  and if noncapable for year  would only be an inconvenience 
the company does not anticipate the costs of implementation of its plan to have a material impact on future earnings and is expected to be funded through operations 
the company is concerned about the readiness of its subcontractors and suppliers 
the company is in the process of communicating with these third parties 
if the company finds third parties whose lack of readiness as to year issues would have a substantial impact on the company s operations  the company will look to replace such subcontractors and suppliers 
in most cases  the company uses more than one subcontractor and supplier so it believes finding replacements will not be difficult 
the company believes it is on track to solve its year issues 
it does not believe it will have material lost revenues due to the year issues 
based on the above  it sees no need to develop a worst case year scenario 
however  the company is in the process of developing year contingency plans which are approximately complete 
inflation inflation has a long term effect on the company because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in increasing sales prices of its homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of the company s homes 
a significant inflationary risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising housing costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which it sells homes  the company has not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on the company because the company generally negotiates fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of its homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of the company s homebuilding cost of sales 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on it s long term debt 
in connection with the company s mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale and the associated mortgage warehouse line of credit are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration and accordingly the risk is not material 
the company does not hedge interest rate risk using financial instruments 
the company is also subject to foreign currency risk but this risk is not material
