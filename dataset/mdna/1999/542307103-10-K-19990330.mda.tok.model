restaurant operating expenses for the year ended december  increased  from  in the year ended december  to  and such expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
this increase is attributable to the national marketing efforts the company has employed in addition to higher fixed costs in the way of building and equipment maintenance costs on the domestic lone star restaurants as well as higher labor and occupancy costs in the australian restaurants  and the effect of other fixed cost components on lower average restaurant sales

this resulted in a charge to earnings of  net of the tax benefit of  such restaurants do not operate as lone star steakhouse saloon restaurants 
other income  principally interest  for the year ended december   was  a  increase from this increase is attributable to the investment for a full year of the remaining net proceeds of the company s public offering in may the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the decrease in the rate is primarily due to certain losses in resulting from the write off of the european joint venture that were not available for deduction 
without the impact of the european joint venture write off  the effective rate was in impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and labor costs 
a large number of the company s restaurant personnel are paid at federal and state established minimum wage levels and  accordingly  changes in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs 
as costs of food and labor have increased  the company has historically been able to offset these increases through economies of scale and improved operating procedures  although there is no assurance that such offsets will continue 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents a summary of the company s cash flows for the years ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investment activities    net cash provided used by financing activities    net effect of exchange rate changes on cash    net increase decrease in cash    during the year ended december   the company s purchases of property and equipment were  the company has opened restaurants in the past three fiscal years of which opened during  in and two in the company does not have significant accounts receivable or inventory and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms in purchasing food and supplies 
because funds available from cash sales are not needed immediately to pay for food and supplies  or to finance inventory  they may be considered as a source of financing for capital expenditures 
at december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
while the company has not established a credit facility  the company believes it could establish a facility on suitable terms 
the company has entered into three leases for new locations 
the company is not actively negotiating purchase or lease of additional sites 
in the future  the company anticipates that a greater proportion of its new restaurant locations will be purchased rather than leased 
during  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december    shares with a cumulative cost of approximately  had been purchased under the program 
beginning in the fourth quarter of the company began utilizing derivative financial instruments in the form of commodity futures contracts to manage market risks and reduce its exposure resulting from fluctuations in the prices of meat 
the company uses live beef cattle futures contracts to accomplish its objective 
realized and unrealized changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument are recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for the period have not been significant 
at december   the company s exposure for open positions in futures contracts were not significant 
year computer issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has instituted a year project to prepare its computer systems and communication systems for the year the project includes identification and assessment of all software  hardware and equipment that could potentially be affected by the year issue and remedial action and further testing  if necessary 
in the fourth quarter of the company committed to a program to install new point of sale devices and systems in most of its restaurants 
in addition  the company is installing a new data base information system that will provide significant enhancements to its capabilities to process and analyze data provided by the new point of sale systems 
the company expects these systems to be fully implemented by mid the hardware and software providers of the new systems have warranted that the new systems are year compliant 
the company believes that certain existing software  hardware and equipment which will continue to be utilized with the new systems are substantially year compliant  but will require some modification and replacement  however if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a significant impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all systems that  it believes  could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that certain parts of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected  particularly the financial reporting systems 
in addition  the company is gathering information about the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and service providers and continues to monitor their compliance 
for its information technology exposures  to date the company estimates that it is complete on the remediation phase and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than june  once software is reprogrammed or replaced for a system  the company begins testing and implementation 
these phases run concurrently for different systems 
to date  the company has completed of its testing and has implemented of its remediated systems 
completion of the testing phase for all significant systems in expected by april   with all recommended systems fully tested and implemented by may   with completion targeted for july  the company has queried its significant suppliers and service providers that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  replace  test and implement the software and hardware equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year issue is estimated to be less than  and the company expects most of the costs will be expensed 
all costs are being funded through operating cash flow 
the projected costs do not include the costs of the new point of sale devices and systems and the costs of equipment  software  and installation of the new data base information system previously discussed 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year project 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company might be unable to process transactional and financial reporting information 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from the year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories  and adjusting staffing strategies
