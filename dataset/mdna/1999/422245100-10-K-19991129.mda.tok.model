the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
the following table sets forth the sources of the company s revenues by customer type as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations for the three years ended august   and year ended august  hospital contracts health plan contracts other the company s hospital based diabetes treatment centers are located in and operated under contracts with general acute care hospitals 
the primary goal of each center is to create a center of excellence for the treatment of diabetes in the community in which it is located and thereby increase the hospital s market share of diabetes patients and lower the hospital s cost of providing services to this population 
the company has a variety of contractual relationships with its client hospitals 
fee structures under the hospital contracts consist of either fixed management fees  incentive based fees or a combination thereof 
incentive arrangements generally provide for fee payments to the company based on changes in the client hospital s market share of diabetes patients and the costs of providing care to these patients 
the form of these contracts includes various structures ranging from arrangements where all costs of the company s program for center professional personnel  medical director fees and community relations are the responsibility of the company to structures where all company program costs are the responsibility of the client hospital 
recent trends in contracting with hospitals are resulting in new and renewed contracts that consist primarily of fixed management fee arrangements 
the terms of hospital contracts generally range from two to five years and are subject to periodic renegotiation and renewal that may include reduction in fee structures which have a negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability 
the following table presents the number of hospital contracts in effect and the number of hospital sites where the company s services were provided under the terms of these contracts or was in the process of initiating operations as of the end of fiscal years  and the number of hospital contracts and hospital sites for these periods includes two arthritis and osteoporosis care center aocc contracts with hospitals to provide comprehensive arthritis and osteoporosis services that are operated by the company 
as of august  hospital contracts hospital sites where services are provided the components of changes to the total number of hospital contracts and hospital sites under these contracts for fiscal years  and are presented below 
year ended august  contracts sites contracts sites contracts sites total contracts sites at beginning of period new contracts sites signed contracts sites discontinued total contracts sites at end of period during fiscal  hospital contracts were renewed 
several of these renewals included contract rate reductions which the company has traditionally undertaken to maintain favorable long term contractual relationships 
also during fiscal  eight hospital contracts were discontinued 
there were no material continuing obligations or costs for the company associated with the termination of any client hospital contracts 
the company anticipates that continued hospital industry pressures to reduce costs because of constrained revenues will result in a continuation of contract rate reductions and the potential for additional contract terminations 
during fiscal  contracts are eligible to be terminated under the terms of the contracts with the hospitals 
while the company s revenues historically have been generated primarily by its operating contracts with hospitals  a majority of fiscal revenues were generated from programs that are designed to assist health plans in reducing the healthcare costs and improving the quality of care for individuals with diabetes enrolled in their plans 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will result from diabetes disease management contracts and other types of disease management contracts with health plans 
implementation of the company s first diabetes disease management contracts with health plans occurred in fiscal the diabetes disease management products enable the company to assist enrollees and the providers of healthcare in the health plan with specific diabetes care and treatment as well as provide assistance for the overall needs of populations of individuals with diabetes 
the company believes that its patient and physician support regimens  delivered and or supervised by a multi disciplinary team  will assist in assuring that the most effective care for the treatment of the disease is provided to enrollees with diabetes and that this focus will reduce both the short term and long term healthcare costs of these enrollees by ultimately reducing or preventing the devastating and costly complications of diabetes 
pursuant to the company s diabetes disease management contracts  the company provides clinical and support staff who are responsible for coordinating and supporting the treatment of individuals with diabetes in accordance with treatment standards and protocols that have been developed by the company and have been approved by the medical leadership at each health plan 
the actual treatment of the individuals is provided by physicians and hospitals who are part of the health plan s network of providers 
the company provides its services under two distinct delivery models reflecting the needs and population concentration of each health plan customer 
under both delivery models  the company s services are designed to coordinate and integrate the healthcare needs of the member population  to improve and promote compliance with generally recognized and evidence based diabetes standards of care  to improve the overall health status of the population  and  as a result  reduce their overall cost of care 
in its diabetes netcare sm delivery model  the company s professional staff are located in the health plan s market area and work directly with the network health care providers  as well as by mail and phone  in the delivery of the diabetes disease management program 
the company s diabetes netlink sm delivery model utilizes a central staff located at its nashville  tennessee call center to provide member and provider services 
the central activities provided by the company s call center staff are augmented by services provided locally to providers by health plan personnel 
in addition to the nashville call center  the company has completed the construction of an additional call center in phoenix  arizona which will commence operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the two call centers have a combined service capacity of approximately  lives 
diabetes disease management contracts require a sophisticated management information system to enable the company to manage the care of large populations of diabetes patients and to assist in reporting outcomes and costs 
the company has developed a clinical management system which it believes meets its information management needs for its diabetes population management services and has installed and is utilizing the system for the enrollees of each of its health plan contract customers 
this system is currently being upgraded to enable the system to handle additional diseases other than diabetes from a common platform and to increase the company s call center capabilities and efficiency with the installation of state of the art dialing  call routing  and information access technologies 
the company has also recently developed an internet based enrollee and provider communication capability for one of its health plan customers 
the company anticipates expansion of this capability to other customers as well as enhancement of the capabilities of its internet communication technology 
it is anticipated that these upgrades to this system will begin to be installed during january and will continue through the remainder of fiscal the capital expenditures required during fiscal to upgrade the company s information technology capability  to complete the phoenix call center and to add the number of lives currently under contract totals approximately million 
as of august   the company had contracts with eight health plans to provide diabetes disease management services to health plan markets 
the number of covered lives under management pursuant to these contracts for its diabetes netcare sm and its diabetes netlink sm products as of august   and is presented on the following table 
at august  covered lives under management diabetes netcare sm    diabetes netlink sm   total covered lives under management    covered lives at august  exclude  diabetes netlink sm contract lives under existing contracts that are scheduled for implementation subsequent to august  and include approximately  diabetes netcare sm lives under a contract that will be discontinued december  in addition  subsequent to august   contracts and letters of intent for an additional  lives in markets with three new customers and two existing customers have been signed and include the first cardiac healthways sm agreement covering approximately  enrollees with cardiac disease 
most of the remainder of the lives under agreements subsequent to august  will be enrolled in the company s diabetes netlink sm program 
the company s health plan contract revenues are dependent upon the contractual relationships it establishes and maintains with client health plans to provide disease management services to their members 
the terms of these health plan contracts generally range from three to five years and are subject to periodic renegotiations and renewal that may include changes in fee structure 
because the disease management industry is relatively new and the company s contracts were some of the first large scale contracts to be executed with health plans for disease management services  the company anticipates that  as additional experience is gained by our customers and by the company in delivering services to chronic disease populations  one or more of these contracts may be restructured prior to the end of the term of the original contract 
no assurances can be given that the results of any future restructurings would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s initial health plan contracts for diabetes disease management services that were entered into during fiscal and fiscal were shared savings diabetes netcare sm contracts with initial terms of five years 
healthcare cost savings resulting from the company s programs at these health plan sites were shared with the health plan according to ratios set forth in the respective contracts 
under these arrangements  the company was at risk for the costs of operating its program and the health plans were at risk for of their members healthcare costs 
because of ramp up periods prior to the generation of healthcare cost savings and the normal time lag associated with claims information necessary to evaluate cost savings  the company s profitability was negatively affected during the first months of operation at each site 
during fiscal and all new diabetes netcare sm and diabetes netlink sm contracts signed with health plans were based on per member per month payments to the company for the health plan s enrollees who have diabetes and participate in the company s programs 
in most of these contracts  individuals with diabetes in these plans are automatically enrolled in the company s program but are permitted to decline to participate 
historically  less than decline to participate 
these contracts are generally for terms of three years with provisions for subsequent renewal and typically provide that between and of the per member per month fee is at risk subject to the company s performance against clinical and financial cost savings criteria 
the structures of the health plan contracts signed during fiscal and significantly reduced or eliminated the start up losses that have been experienced under the health plan contracts signed during fiscal and in addition  during fiscal all health plan contracts signed during fiscal and were converted to per member per month structures or were terminated as part of a mutual agreement reached with coventry healthcare to discontinue six diabetes netcare sm site operations at principal healthcare hmos acquired by coventry healthcare during fiscal consequently  as of august   the company did not have any shared savings contracts with health plans for its diabetes disease management products 
as a result of the mutual agreement to terminate the coventry healthcare contracts in july  the company recorded additional revenue of approximately million associated with this settlement and also recorded additional costs of million associated with the termination of services at these locations 
the resulting pretax profit of approximately million from this settlement was recognized during the company s fourth fiscal quarter of during fiscal  a contract with a health plan formerly owned by principal healthcare was terminated by mutual agreement with the new owner of that health plan 
during fiscal  one health plan contract covering less than  lives will terminate unless renewed 
however  several health plan contracts provide for early termination by the health plan if the company does not meet certain performance standards 
subsequent to august  the company and a health plan customer mutually decided to terminate a pilot program contract begun during fiscal covering approximately  lives under a diabetes netcare sm arrangement 
the company also provides diabetes netcare sm services to this customer at other locations  which have not been affected by this pilot project termination 
the loss of this contract is not expected to have a material negative impact upon the company s profitability in fiscal during fiscal and during the initial months of fiscal  the company s disease management services were extended to additional health plan sites or health plan products by several of its health plan customers by additions to the initial contracts 
additionally  subsequent to august   the stated term of an agreement with cigna healthcare to provide diabetes netlink sm services was extended from october  to september  and also included the addition of approximately  covered lives at nine additional health plan sites to be managed for cigna healthcare bringing the total lives under this contract to over  while no assurances can be provided that this trend of additional lives from existing health plan customers will continue in fiscal  the company anticipates further extension of services to additional health plan sites and products of its existing health plan customers during fiscal the company s strategy is to develop additional relationships with health plans and to further develop and expand its hospital based diabetes treatment center business 
during fiscal  the company introduced its comprehensive cardiac disease management program  cardiac healthways sm  for health plans and plans to develop or acquire a respiratory disease management program 
it is the company s strategy to provide health plans with programs that address the needs of enrollees with each of these chronic diseases and to support the management of these diseases from a common clinical  information technology and business platform 
the company anticipates that it will utilize its state of the art call center and medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering its health plan decease management services 
the company has been marketing its cardiac healthways sm program since the third quarter of fiscal and subsequent to august  has entered into a letter of intent with a health plan to provide disease management services that include cardiac services to approximately  enrollees with cardiac disease beginning during the second quarter of fiscal while the company has also made proposals to health plans that include respiratory disease management services  these proposals have been made in conjunction with a privately owned respiratory disease management company that would provide these services to the health plan 
it is anticipated that the company will continue to make such joint proposals until it has developed or acquired its own respiratory disease management capabilities 
it is the company s intent to have this respiratory capability by the end of calendar in november  the company received an administrative subpoena for documents from a regional office of the office of the inspector general oig of the department of health and human services in connection with an investigation of dtca under certain federal medicare and medicaid statutes 
on february   the company learned that the federal government had declined to take over and pursue a civil whistle blower action brought under seal in june on behalf of the government by a former employee dismissed by the company in february the company believes that this lawsuit triggered the oig investigation 
the civil suit was filed in june against the company  dtca  and certain named and unnamed medical directors and client hospitals and was kept under seal to permit the government to determine whether to take over the lawsuit 
following its review  the government made the determination not to take over the litigation  and the complaint was unsealed on february  various preliminary motions have been filed regarding jurisdictional and pleading matters  resulting in the filing of a number of amended complaints and the dismissal of the company as a defendant 
dtca continues to be a defendant 
various procedural motions on this case are pending resolution before the discovery stage of the case can proceed 
the company has cooperated fully with the oig in its investigation  and believes that its operations have been conducted in full compliance with applicable statutory requirements 
although there can be no assurance that the existence of  or the results of  the investigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company  the company believes that the resolution of issues  if any  which may be raised by the government and the resolution of the civil litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations except to the extent that the company incurs material legal expenses associated with its defense of this matter and the civil suit 
year compliance plan historically  many computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the program failing to properly recognize a year that begins with instead of 
potential system failures or miscalculations are generally referred to as year issues 
while the company s business does not involve the sale of computer services or medical equipment that might be affected by year compliance  the company does make extensive use of information technologies to support its operations 
in particular  the company s health plan disease management operations are structured around its electronic medical record capability and various data interchange capabilities with its health plan customers 
the underlying electronic medical record system upon which the company s proprietary standards of care are built is licensed from an outside software company 
the company has an extensive effort in progress addressing year compliance 
this year project addresses software applications  information technology hardware  other infrastructure and customer and other third party relationships and data exchanges 
the structured approach of this project includes compiling an inventory of affected technology  systems and processes  assessing year compliance for critical components of the company s operations and selection of appropriate remediation efforts where required  remediating  converting or replacing each critical non compliant component  testing each critical component for compliance  and implementing remediated and tested components 
because the company is highly dependent  particularly in its health plan operations  on the ability of its customers to provide the company with enrollment  claims and other data which is utilized by the company to provide services under its contracted service agreements  the year project also includes activities related to coordinating and  in some cases  testing compliance of key data exchange systems with the company s customers 
as of november   the company has completed all five phases of its year project for its critical components of operations 
as part of its year project  the company identified the electronic medical record utilized in its health plan operations as its primary mission critical component and has completed a planned upgrade of this software capability to a version of the base electronic medical record that the third party provider of this platform represents as year compliant 
this conversion is designed to position the company to realize significant operating enhancements for the system in addition to year compliance 
as of november   this upgrade project is substantially complete and all components of the upgraded electronic medical record have been remediated  tested and implemented 
the company s survey of its customers and critical vendors to determine their readiness for year compliance is substantially complete 
no potential compliance problems have been identified with customers or critical vendors 
the company believes that all of its critical systems and processes are now year compliant and the company s survey of its customers and vendors has identified no potential compliance problems 
some non critical systems may not be addressed until after january  however  the company believes that the potential failure of some or all of these non critical systems will not have a material adverse effect on its operations 
the company incurred approximately  in operating expenditures during fiscal  which represents approximately of the company s information technology operating expenses for the fiscal year ended august   to support the year project and estimates that it will spend an additional  in operating expenses primarily during the first half of fiscal to complete the year project 
no expenditures were incurred for the year project during fiscal in addition  the company currently anticipates that accelerated capital expenditures because of year issues will total less than  although the company anticipates that a significant focus of its health plan information technology system development resources throughout the first four months of fiscal will be directed toward year compliance efforts  the company believes that it has the resources and capabilities to support other information technology projects  including a major upgrade of its electronic medical record capability to provide a multiple disease management platform 
the company believes that its ability to add new health plan business and hospital center business will not be materially impacted by its year efforts 
while the company believes that it has successfully completed the substantial portion of its year project  there can be no assurance that it will not incur unexpected difficulties in year compliance or that one or more of its customers or critical vendors will not experience unexpected difficulties that impact their ability to be year compliant 
the failure of the company s critical systems or the failure of one or more of its large health plan customers  the failure of a significant number of its hospital customers or the failure of one or more of its critical vendors to be year compliant and the inability to correct any such non compliance within a relatively short period of time would materially impact the ability of the company to provide services and earn revenues and or receive cash payments from its customers 
the company has developed contingency plans that address potential year compliance related failure of its critical systems as well as year compliance related failures of major customers of the company or its most critical vendors 
while these contingency plans include  among other considerations  manual procedures for certain critical automated systems and the availability of additional financial resources to deal with scenarios that interrupt the company s payments from customers  all of the company s contingency plans address short term company  customer or vendor compliance issues 
the costs to implement the contingency plans that address these short term compliance failures are not expected to be material to the company s operations 
however  should any compliance problem interrupt the company s services or should major customers or critical vendors experience significant compliance problems for extended periods of time such as complete shut down beyond a two week period of time  the company s contingency plans will likely not be sufficient to prevent such a failure or failures from having a material negative impact on the operations of the company 
results of operations the operations of the company represent the results of operations of dtca and the corporate costs of american healthcorp  inc included in the results from discontinued operations are charges to amsurg prior to the distribution for general management  administrative and accounting services provided by the company 
charges to amsurg for such services approximated the company s cost 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for included million resulting from the settlement with coventry healthcare terminating diabetes disease management contracts at six hmo sites effective july  the increase in revenues of million from to resulted primarily from an increase in the average number of lives enrolled in the company s health plan diabetes disease management contracts to approximately  for from approximately  for this increase in the average number of lives under management was primarily the result of new health plan contracts signed during fiscal and the average revenue per member per month for enrollees under the company s health plan contracts for was less than for this decrease in average per member per month revenue occurred primarily as a result of a greater mix of the lower revenue diabetes netlink sm lives in as compared to and also as a result of higher revenues for the diabetes netcare sm lives during attributable to contracts with shared healthcare cost savings fee structures which have been replaced with per member per month fee structures in these increases in health plan contract revenues were offset partially by decreased revenues from hospital treatment center contracts 
revenues from the company s hospital contract operations for were less than for on a slightly higher average number of contracts in operation during as compared with this reduction in hospital contract revenue is due primarily to contract fee reductions and to a greater mix of relatively newer contracts with somewhat lower fees in compared with the company anticipates that revenues for fiscal will increase over fiscal revenues primarily as a result of additional lives enrolled under its existing and new health plan disease management contracts offset somewhat by lower revenues from hospital contract operations resulting from contract fee reductions and contract terminations 
the increase in salaries and benefits of million for over resulted primarily from higher staffing levels associated with increases in the number of lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts partially offset by decreased employee incentive compensation awards associated with operating performance during and approximately  in severance and other employee related costs incurred in associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare contracts 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance at the company s health plan contract operations 
the company anticipates salaries and benefits expense to increase during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased staff  including the staff for the new phoenix  arizona call center  required for expected increases in the number of lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts 
the increase in other operating expenses of  for compared with resulted primarily from higher costs associated with increases in the average number of lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts offset by other operating expenses of approximately  associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare contracts incurred in other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance of the company s health plan contracts and the impact of the termination costs for the coventry healthcare sites during the company anticipates other operating expenses will increase during compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased costs associated with anticipated increases in the number of lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of  for from resulted principally from increased depreciation expense associated with furniture  equipment and computer related capital expenditures associated with its diabetes disease management operations for health plans 
the company anticipates depreciation and amortization expense to increase during compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased information technology and other capital expenditures associated with expected increases in the number of covered lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts  including the capital costs associated with the opening of the new phoenix  arizona call center  as well as from upgrades and additions to the company s information technology capabilities 
the company s income tax expense of million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for resulted from improved operating performance in compared to and as a result of the income tax benefit generated in from the non recurring stock option expense adjustment associated with the amsurg distribution 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and the company s effective tax and benefit rates during and are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and the amortization of excess costs over net assets of purchased companies which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues of million for from resulted from improved performance under the company s shared savings health plan contracts for diabetes disease management services  an increase in the average number of lives enrolled in the company s diabetes disease management contracts to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as well as from million of revenue in fiscal resulting from the settlement with coventry healthcare terminating diabetes disease management contracts at six hmo sites covering approximately  enrolled lives effective july  these increases in health plan contract revenues were offset partially by decreased revenues from hospital treatment center contracts which were less than for due to contract rate renegotiations and restructurings and from a decrease in the average number of hospital contracts in operation between the periods from contracts during to contracts during the increase in salaries and benefits of million for over resulted primarily from higher staffing levels associated with increases in the number of lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts  from increased employee incentive compensation awards associated with improved operating performance during and from severance and other employee related costs of approximately  associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare contracts 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance at its health plan contract operations and as a result of the settlement associated with the coventry healthcare contract terminations 
the increase in other operating expenses of million for over resulted primarily from higher costs associated with increases in the average number of lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts and from other operating expenses of approximately  associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare contracts 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance at the company s health plan contracts 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of  for from resulted from decreased amortization expense associated with its hospital treatment center operations as a result of expensing contract start up costs as incurred during in comparison to amortizing these costs over periods of one to three years during prior years 
this decrease was offset somewhat by the increased depreciation expense associated with furniture  equipment and computer related capital expenditures associated with its diabetes disease management operations for health plans 
as a result of the company s distribution of its amsurg common stock and pursuant to the terms of the company s stock option plans  the number of shares issuable pursuant to the company s outstanding stock options and the exercise price per share were adjusted to maintain the value of the options subsequent to the distribution at the pre distribution level 
this adjustment had the effect of reducing the average exercise price of outstanding options to per share from per share and resulted in an additional  shares being subject to options 
additionally  all outstanding options became fully vested 
as a result of this adjustment of the stock options  generally accepted accounting principles required that the company record non cash compensation expense and an equal increase in stockholders equity additional paid in capital in an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate exercise price of outstanding options to purchase shares of the company s common stock having an exercise price below the market price of the company s common stock and the aggregate market price for such shares immediately prior to the distribution 
the compensation expense and associated increase in additional paid in capital were recognized because generally accepted accounting principles require such recognition when an adjustment results in a change in the ratio of the exercise price to the market price per share even though no change in the aggregate value of the options has taken place 
the impact of this adjustment on the company s financial statements is summarized below net income increase decrease compensation expense  estimated deferred income tax benefit  net decrease in net income  stockholders equity increase decrease increase in paid in capital  net decrease in net income  net increase in stockholder s equity  the company s income tax benefit increased to million for compared to  for primarily as a result of the income tax benefit generated in from the non recurring stock option expense adjustment associated with the amsurg distribution offset partially by improved operating performance in the company s operating results before consideration of this stock option expense adjustment 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and the company s effective tax benefit rates during both and are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and the amortization of excess costs over net assets of purchased companies which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
the results of operations from discontinued operations for and for include the company s share of amsurg s net income or loss based on the company s percentage ownership of amsurg as well as the company s expenses associated with the distribution which totaled  during and  during liquidity and capital resources operating activities for fiscal generated million in cash flow

financing activities for fiscal generated  in cash flow which included million in proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase the company s common stock offset partially by  used to repurchase the company s stock 
the company believes that cash flow from operating activities and its available cash balances of million at august  will continue to enable the company to fund its working capital needs  capital expenditures totaling approximately million associated with its growing health plan operations  including the development of respiratory disease management capability  and the leasehold improvements and other associated costs totaling approximately million for its relocated and expanded corporate and primary support office location in nashville  tennessee 
in addition  the company may utilize its cash resources to fund repurchases of its common stock  as of august  the company had repurchased  shares of common stock pursuant to an authorization by the board of directors in january to purchase up to  shares in open market and private transactions from time to time prior to january  the company has received a letter of commitment for a million credit facility from a bank to provide borrowing capacity for capital expenditures and for working capital needs including unforeseen working capital needs associated with year compliance problems that may be experienced by its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that this financing will be completed on terms acceptable to the company
