this is offset by the expansion of imaging revenues with lower gross profit margins 
during fiscal  the company experienced margin pressures in the long term care business as a result of its large chain customers renegotiating prices due to the implementation of pps 
the company expects this trend to continue in the long term care business 
the company added a net addition of approximately sales representatives in fiscal to develop sales to independent and regional customers to offset the impact of decreased margins in its chain customer sales

gross profit  as a percentage of net sales was and for the three months ended april  and march   respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is attributable to i an allowance for inventory charge  as discussed below  ii the increase in the portion of the customer base represented by national chain customers which produce lower gross profit as a percentage of sales but require lower distribution costs as a percentage of sales  and iii the lower gross profit percentage of the company acquired 
historically  management has raised the gross profit percentage of acquired companies by reducing purchase costs as a result of increased purchase volume 
during the three months ended april   a million allowance for inventory charge was recorded 
this charge is directly related to a change of plans  uses  and disposition efforts which new gulf south management had as compared to prior management 
as a result  gross profit did not increase proportionately compared to the increase in net sales 
gulf south previously disclosed in its fiscal form k that they had generally been able to return any unsold or obsolete inventory to the manufacturer  resulting in negligible inventory write offs 
gulf south s prior management had a policy of keeping old or overstocked inventory on the warehouse shelf until the inventory could ultimately be sold 
as such  this policy kept the inventory on the books with what was deemed to be an appropriate obsolescence reserve 
new management  on the other hand  determined that it was not cost effective  from an operational standpoint  to continue warehousing and financing such old or overstocked inventory 
also  the company does not normally allow product with less than desirable box or labeling conditions to be shipped to its customers 
as such  consistent with the operational policies at the company s other divisions  management decided to dispose of  certain inventories that did not meet the company s dating  box condition  or labeling requirements  or in which excessive quantities existed 
this decision to significantly alter gulf south s inventory retention and buying policies  and  therefore  to dispose of the related inventories resulted in a change in the ultimate valuation of the impacted inventories 
this charge was recognized in the period in which management made the decision to dispose of the affected inventory  which was gulf south s quarter ended april  selling expenses 
selling expenses for the three months ended april  totaled million  an increase of million or over the three months ended march  total of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses decreased to for the three months ended april  from for the three months ended march  the decrease in selling expense as a percentage of net sales is the result of the increase in the portion of the customer base represented by national chain customers on which gulf south does not pay sales commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended april  totaled million  an increase of million or over the three months ended march  total of million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were and for the three months ended april  and march   respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to i merger costs and expenses  ii restructuring costs and expenses  iii other unusual items  iv increased operating costs  v inefficiencies due to gulf south s merger with the company  and vi loss of efficiencies resulting from the process of integrating acquired distribution centers 
the following table summarizes the components of the charges included in general and administrative expenses as outlined in i  ii  and iii above in thousands 
three months ended april  reconciling items  direct transaction costs related to the merger  increase allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring costs and expenses  legal fees and settlements  operational tax charge  goodwill impairment charge  total charges included in general administrative expenses  reconciling items 
this amount represents the charge needed to reconcile gulf south s financial statements to its underlying books and records 
direct transaction costs related to the merger 
direct transaction costs primarily consist of professional fees  such as investment banking  legal  and accounting  for services rendered through the date of the merger 
as of april   all direct transaction costs were paid 
due to subsequent negotiations and agreements between the company and its service provider  actual costs paid were less than costs originally billed and recorded 
as a result  approximately of costs were reversed against general and administrative expenses during the quarter ended september  increase allowance for doubtful accounts 
this charge relates directly to a change of plans and collection efforts which new management had as compared to prior gulf south management 
gulf south previously disclosed in its fiscal form k that credit losses had consistently been within management s expectations and that the company had not experienced any failure to collect accounts receivable from its largest customers 
gulf south s prior management had a policy of continuing collection efforts on aged and small receivables and keeping those receivables on the books  with what was deemed to be an appropriate reserve 
under new management  the collection efforts for receivables changed in order to be consistent with the operational policies at the company s other divisions 
effective with the closing of the transaction  new management determined that it was not cost effective  from an operational standpoint  to continue old management s collection efforts on what it considered excessively old or small customer receivables 
as such  consistent with the operational policies at the company s other divisions  management decided to write off the related aged receivables 
this change in operational policies resulted in a change in the ultimate collectability of the related receivables and this charge was recognized in the period in which the operational decision to change collection efforts was made  which was gulf south s quarter ended april  restructuring costs and expenses 
in order to improve customer service  reduce costs  and improve productivity and asset utilization  the company decided to realign and consolidate its operations with gulf south

see note  charges included in general and administrative expenses  and note  restatements  for more discussion related to this issue 
goodwill impairment charges 
the  goodwill impairment charge relates primarily to a prior gulf south acquisition 
during the quarter ended april   a dispute with the acquired company s prior owners and management resulted in the loss of key employees and all operational information related to the acquired customer base 
this ultimately affected gulf south s ability to conduct business related to this acquisition  and impacted gulf south s ability to recover the value assigned to the goodwill asset 
loss income from operations

provision for income taxes

net income for fiscal year totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the fiscal year total of million 
as a percentage of net sales  net income remained constant at for fiscal year and liquidity and capital resources as the company s business grows  its cash and working capital requirements will also continue to increase as a result of the need to finance acquisitions and anticipated growth of the company s operations 
this growth will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations  revolving credit borrowings and proceeds from any future public offerings 
net cash used in provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal operating cash flow over prior years was primarily attributable to i million of cash paid for merger and restructuring accruals established in the current and prior years  ii accounts receivable and inventory growth in the imaging division  iii approximately million in accounts payable funding in excess of normal operations  and iv working capital requirements of the best practices and distribution upgrades at gulf south 
these amounts were offset by continued leveraging of fixed operating costs

inventory financing historically has been achieved through negotiating extended payment terms from suppliers 
the company has historically been able to finance its liquidity needs for expansion through lines of credit provided by banks and proceeds from the public and private offering of stock and debt 
in may  the company completed an initial public offering of common stock resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
in november  the company completed a secondary offering of common stock 
the company used approximately million and million of the total secondary offering net proceeds of million to repay company debt and debt assumed through acquisitions in fiscal years and  respectively 
management used the remaining proceeds in connection with acquisitions for the imaging  physician supply  and international businesses  and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures during fiscal years and on october   the company issued  in a private offering under rule a of the securities act of  an aggregate principal amount of million of its senior subordinated notes due in the private notes with net proceeds to the company of million after deduction for offering costs 
the private notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
on february   the company closed its offer to exchange the private notes for senior subordinated notes the notes of the company with substantially identical terms to the private notes except that the notes do not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions 
interest on the notes accrues from the date of original issuance and is payable semiannually on april and october of each year  commencing on april   at a rate of per annum 
the semiannual payments of approximately million will be funded by the operating cash flow of the company 
no other principal payments on the notes are required over the next five years 
the notes contain certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness 
provided  however  that no event of default exist  additional indebtedness may be incurred if the company maintains a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  of greater than to on february   the company entered into a million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions with nationsbank  na as principal agent

as of april   the company has not entered into any material working capital commitments that require funding 
the company believes that the expected cash flows from operations  available borrowing under the credit facility  and capital markets are sufficient to meet the company s anticipated future requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company did not hold any derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company is subject to interest rate risk and certain foreign currency risk relating to its operations in europe  however  the company does not consider its exposure in such areas to be material

year readiness disclosure the following disclosure is a year readiness disclosure within the context of the year information and readiness disclosure act to the extent allowed by that act 
year problem many computer programs and hardware with embedded technology use only two digits to identify a year in a date field within a program eg  or 
these programs or hardware may fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s due to the two digit date fields 
if uncorrected  such programs and hardware with date sensitive operations may malfunction or fail to operate after and possibly before the year in some instances 
company s year program and systems the company has developed  and is implementing  a year program to address both information technology it and non it systems 
the company s business applications reside on a group of mini computers  servers and personal computers 
the company also uses laptop computers that serve as sales force and service technician automation tools 
the company s it systems include computer and data network hardware  internally developed software  and software purchased or licensed from external vendors 
the company s non it systems include equipment which uses date sensitive embedded technology 
principal non it systems include telecommunications and warehouse equipment 
the company initiated a year compliance program during may  and the progress of this program has been communicated regularly to the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the company s approach to address the year compliance program includes the following phases inventory  assessment  planning  remediation  testing  and implementation  third party risk management  and business continuity planning 
company s state of year readiness the company believes that its existing systems are substantially year compliant  except that the company lacks sufficient information to determine the year status of recently acquired companies 
the recently acquired companies are scheduled to be converted to company s substantially compliant systems before the end of september the company substantially completed inventory  assessment  and plans for remediation of its critical it systems during the quarter ended december remediation and testing of these critical systems included upgrading  replacing  or modifying non compliant components  and was substantially completed during the quarter ended march implementation of these remediation efforts is now substantially complete  and has been substantially complete since the quarter ended june as a precaution against possible errors or omissions to our remediation efforts  ongoing testing of all systems  critical and non critical is targeted to continue through the end of september additional remediation will occur as licensors offer remedies to year issues or in the event undetected system non compliance issues are uncovered 
as stated above  recent acquisitions of companies by the imaging business have added to our remediation efforts 
the company does not fully know the state of year readiness of the acquired companies 
as a result  seven acquired service centers are targeted to be integrated into the imaging division s distribution it system as branches prior to the end of september currently  the imaging business has of service centers  and its corporate location systems converted to its new year compliant system 
the progress of these integrations will be closely monitored  the year readiness of these branches will be assessed  and contingency plans will be modified accordingly 
the company is also in the process of completing an inventory and assessment of its non critical it and all non it systems 
remediation efforts of non critical systems include the development and implementation of iconweb  a new enhanced version of the physician supply business s sales force automation software  and the remediation of the accuscan software that gulf south provides its customers to monitor and order inventory 
the new iconweb software  which includes enhanced functionality  is currently being piloted and is targeted for complete implementation prior to the end of november remediated software has been implemented at approximately of the customers currently using accuscan 
the remaining customers are targeted for implementation prior to the end of september the company estimates that it will complete inventories  assessments  planning  remediation  and testing of all other non critical it and all non it systems by the end of september costs for company s year program the total costs of addressing the company s year readiness issues are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
since initiation of its program in calendar year  the company has expensed approximately million on a worldwide basis in costs on a pretax basis to address its year readiness issues 
these expenditures include information system replacement and embedded technology upgrade costs of million  supplier and customer compliance costs of million and all other costs of million 
the company currently estimates that the total of such costs for addressing its internal year readiness  on a worldwide basis  will approximate million in the aggregate on a pretax basis 
these costs are being expensed as they are incurred  except for purchases of computer hardware and other equipment  which are capitalized as property and equipment and depreciated over the equipment s estimated useful lives in accordance with the company s normal accounting policies 
all costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
no projects material to the financial condition  or results of operations of the company have been deferred or delayed as a result of the year program 
a large part of the year effort has been accomplished through the redeployment of existing resources 
the cost of such redeployment or of internal management time has not been specifically quantified 
as reported previously  concurrent with the year modifications and upgrades to existing systems  the company is currently replacing a majority of its internal information systems hardware and software with new systems new systems that are year compliant 
the aforementioned amounts specifically exclude the costs associated with the implementations  but not the testing of these new systems which are being installed primarily to integrate operations and achieve additional information technology functionality 
both internal and external resources are being used to identify  correct and test the company s systems for year compliance 
a year program manager has been assigned to coordinate the company s year compliance program at all of the company s divisions 
to assist the company in meeting its year responsibilities  the company has contracted with external consultants specializing in year readiness assessments 
the goal of these consultants was to assist the company in evaluating the year programs  processes and progress of its us divisions  and to help identify any remaining areas of effort advisable 
the company s original cost estimates for testing  third party year risks  and contingency planning were revised as a result of the consultant s independent assessment of the scope of the company s program 
these consultants will be engaged through the end of calendar year the company s year efforts will be assessed and reported to executive management as part of this ongoing engagement 
in addition  the company has engaged its attorneys and other outside consultants to assist or examine selected critical areas 
the company has consulted insurance professionals and is exploring possible mitigation of year risks through purchasing insurance 
budgeted costs for these ongoing engagements are estimated at million and are included in the total costs estimates above 
with respect to non it system issues  the company is unable to estimate its remediation costs since it does not have available information upon which to measure the cost of year compliance in this area 
while the total costs to become year compliant in the non it system area are not known at this time  management does not believe that such costs will have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  or results of operations of the company 
third party year risks the company could be adversely affected if critical manufacturers  suppliers  customers  banks  payers  utilities  transportation companies  or other business partners fail to properly remediate their systems to achieve year compliance 
as planned  the company has initiated communications  which include soliciting written responses to questionnaires  inquiries and follow up meetings  with critical manufacturers  suppliers  customers and other business partners to determine the extent to which any year issues affecting such third parties would affect the company 
such communications are ongoing and are expected to continue through the end of calendar year  with action plans developed and implemented as necessary 
the company has established a plan for ongoing monitoring of critical manufacturers  suppliers  customers  and other business partners during calendar year however  many critical manufacturers  suppliers  customers and other business partners have as yet  either declined to provide the requested assurances or have limited the scope of assurances to which they are willing to commit 
naturally  most third parties are unwilling to guarantee that they will achieve year compliance 
the company is subject to risk should government or private payers including insurers fail to become year compliant and  therefore  be unable to make full or timely reimbursement to the company s customers 
for example  if the federal government were unable to make payments under the medicaid or medicare programs due to year failures  the company s customers that derive a significant portion of their revenues from these government programs could be adversely affected 
such a situation could have a material adverse affect on the company s cash flows  financial position  or results of operations by reducing the ability of customers to pay for products purchased from the company 
since the company s year plan is dependent in part upon these suppliers  customers and other key third parties being year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to assess third parties year readiness will be able to prevent a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  or results of operations in future periods should a significant number of third parties experience business disruptions as a result of their lack of year compliance 
additionally  third party failures to adequately address the year issue could significantly disrupt the company s operations and possibly lead to litigation against the company 
the costs and expenses associated with any such failure or litigation  or with any disruptions in the economy in general as a result of the year  are not presently estimable  but could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
other year risks and contingency planing management of the company believes that its year compliance program will be effective in avoiding significant adverse consequences due to year problems with its systems 
the company has  however  begun mitigating identified risks  and is developing contingency plans to address situations that may arise where the company s systems or third party systems experience year problems 
as part of this effort  the company has been assessing the viability of its entire supply chain and is developing contingency plans to provide alternatives in the event year related issues arise 
current contingency alternatives center on human resource issues  substitute sources of utilities  inventory management  and the development of a rapid response capability and a monitoring process for critical communications during the transition into the year the company is developing and executing employee awareness plans to assist with the implementation of the company s year efforts 
the company is alerting customers of their need to address year problems  specifically their need to address risks associated with non compliant it and non it equipment that they may have been or are relying on 
if the company were to experience significant year problems due to a failure in its systems or a third party s systems  the company would revert to interim manual methods of conducting business 
in developing contingency plans  the company will be prioritizing its systems and affected operations  and developing emergency measures to address potential systems failures that could significantly affect the company s business operations 
likewise  the company s contingency plans will address year risks associated with year potential failures experienced by third parties 
additionally  the company is in the process of updating its information technology disaster recovery plan to include year contingencies that may arise 
risks to achieving year compliance include the availability of resources  the company s ability to discover and correct potential year problems which could have a serious impact on specific systems  equipment or facilities  and the ability of the company s significant vendors  payers and customers to make their systems year compliant 
even with contingency plans in place  there can be no assurance that company will avoid experiencing problems relating to year problems
