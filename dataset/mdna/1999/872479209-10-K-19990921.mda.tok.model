overview tii designs  manufactures and markets overvoltage surge protectors  network interface devices nids and station electronics for use in the communications industry 
the company has been a leading supplier of overvoltage surge protectors to us telephone operating companies telcos for over years 
the company s results of operations were affected by several non recurring factors in fiscal and to meet its customers needs  the company introduced a line of broadband nids with features and functionality that the company believes were instrumental in its winning two major contracts in july and september of with an rboc and an independent telco  respectively  each of which was a pre existing unaffiliated customer 
for strategic purposes  the company accepted orders under one of these contracts that it believed it could fulfill under an aggressive delivery time schedule that mandated it to seek to accelerate production 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company incurred additional manufacturing expenses in gearing up toward the accelerated production of its new broadband nid product line  compounded  in the second quarter of fiscal  by production disruptions as the company sought to meet a customer s requested delivery schedules 
these additional manufacturing costs included the hiring of temporary personnel during the initial phases of production  the temporary outsourcing of certain production processes  initial purchases of materials in smaller than usual quantities for which volume discounts were not available  lower initial manufacturing yields and additional freight and other expediting costs 
additionally  results were also adversely affected by continuing expenditures relating to the company s movement of certain production processes to the company s facility in the dominican republic 
the disruptions were primarily caused by the failure of certain vendors to meet the company s delivery requirements for required molds and inventory components  production breakdowns which produced significant delays and yield losses during the initial production process and delays in completing the training of permanent employees for both the company s puerto rico and dominican republic facilities  as well as the hiring of temporary manufacturing employees at its puerto rico facilities to meet the accelerated production schedule 
while the company resolved most of the production disruption issues toward the end of the second quarter  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company continued to experience certain yield losses  costs associated with outsourcing the production of certain injection molded parts and added costs to air freight products to meet customer delivery requirements 
on september and   the company s principal operating facilities in toa alta  puerto rico and san pedro de macoris  dominican republic  respectively  sustained significant inventory  equipment and facility damages as a result of hurricane georges 
in addition  as a result of the storm  the company experienced production stoppages during the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal and periods of less than full production continuing into the fiscal third quarter 
both facilities became fully operational during the third fiscal quarter 
damaged inventory  business interruption losses  fees payable to the company s insurance advisors  losses to plant and equipment and other expenses incurred totaled million 
the company received insurance payments of million with respect to the losses sustained  including lost profits 
accordingly  insurance proceeds net of hurricane losses and expenses resulted in a gain of million in fiscal in order to focus on its core business  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its fiber optic subsidiary  tii ditel  inc  in march for million 
the resulting gain of million is included in other income in fiscal sales of tii ditel  inc represented approximately  and of the company s consolidated sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company initiated a strategic operations re alignment in an effort to enhance operating efficiencies and reduce costs 
these results are expected to be achieved through outsourcing a significant portion of the company s production  closing the company s dominican republic facility  workforce reductions and other cost saving measures throughout the company 
under this plan  the company expects to reduce its workforce from approximately  employees as of april to approximately by the end of fiscal  including reductions resulting from the completion of the sale of non core businesses 
as a result  the company recorded a charge to earnings of million in fiscal comprised of million for severance and employee termination benefits   for plant closure costs and million to reduce the carrying value of leasehold improvements  plant and equipment to be abandoned or sold to their estimated net realizable value 
fiscal years ended june   june  and june  net sales for fiscal decreased by million or to million from million in fiscal the decline resulted primarily from a decrease in product shipped due to the company s production disruptions caused by hurricane georges 
sales of the company s fiber optic product line decreased by  as the company sold this product line on march  these declines were partially offset by an increase in sales of the company s nid product line 
net sales for fiscal decreased by  or 
to million from million in fiscal the decline resulted primarily from a decrease in product shipped due to the company s production disruptions in gearing up toward the accelerated production of broadband nids  partially offset by an increase in sales of its fiber optic product line 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of sales  versus million  or of sales  in fiscal gross profit margins improved as a result of the company s effort to reduce production costs and because comparability was effected by the abnormally low gross profit margins in the second quarter of fiscal due to production disruptions experienced in that year 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of sales  versus million  or of sales  in fiscal this decline related to the increased production costs incurred by the company while producing new nid products under sales contracts won in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or to million from million in fiscal due to increased personnel  promotion and other expenses associated with the company s efforts to promote new products  including its coaxial cable surge protector product line 
in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from legal  accounting and other expenses incurred in connection with a withdrawn public offering of the company s common stock in the second quarter of fiscal and additional personnel and promotion costs associated with the company s efforts to obtain and fulfill new sales contracts 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased by  or to million 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased by  or to million from million in fiscal the increases related primarily to a greater number of personnel  and to higher prototype and testing costs associated with product development for expansion of the company s product lines  including its broadband surge protectors 
interest expense in fiscal increased  to  due to increased borrowings under the company s credit facilities while the company was awaiting receipt of insurance proceeds from claims resulting from hurricane georges 
with the receipt of these insurance proceeds  interest expense is expected to be lower in fiscal in fiscal  interest expense declined  to  from  in fiscal as a result of lower average loan balances 
interest income in fiscal decreased  to  from  in fiscal and by  from  in fiscal the decline in both years was due to decreased averaged cash and marketable securities balances held by the company during those respective years 
interest income is expected to increase in the future as the company has higher cash balances after the receipt of the insurance proceeds received due to hurricane georges 
other income expenses for fiscal includes a million gain on the sale of the company s fiber optic product line 
the company accrued a tax provision for fiscal for the settlement of an audit performed by the internal revenue service  resulting in a net provision of  for the year 
income taxes the company is incorporated in delaware with its principal operations office located in the commonwealth of puerto rico 
the company has elected the application of section of the us internal revenue code code for its puerto rico operations  and presently intends to continue to operate in a fashion that will enable it to qualify for the section election 
the calculation of the amount of allowable credits under section is based upon qualified wages paid for services performed in puerto rico  fringe benefits  depreciation deductions and taxes in puerto rico 
based on fiscal levels of qualified wages  fringe benefits  depreciation and taxes in puerto rico  the company s economic activity based credit limitation is approximately  per annum 
this amount is likely to decrease in the future as the company completes its operations re alignment and reduces expenditures for wages  fringe benefits  depreciation and taxes in puerto rico 
although the section credit has been repealed  the company continues to be eligible to claim a section credit until the year ended june under a special grandfather rule 
puerto rico income eligible for the section credit in any tax year beginning after december  and before january  is subject to an additional limitation calculated for the company to be  of taxable income 
the company s section credit for each year during the grandfather period would continue to be subject to the economic activity limitation as discussed above 
based on the company s current level of puerto rico income and business plans  the company believes that it will be eligible to claim a section credit under the grandfather rule discussed above 
due to its election to operate under section of the internal revenue code and the availability of certain net operating loss carryforwards and exemptions from income taxes in puerto rico and in the dominican republic  the company has not been required to pay united states federal  puerto rico or dominican republic taxes on most of its income during fiscal years  and see note to notes to consolidated financial statements

during fiscal  cash of million was provided by investing activities  which consisted of million of net insurance proceeds for losses from hurricane georges and million from the sale of subsidiary assets  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
financing activities used million  including a net repayment of debt and obligations under capital leases of million 
the company has no commitments for capital expenditures  but expects to purchase new equipment and incur leasehold improvements in the normal course of business  subject to the maximum amounts permitted under its revolving credit facility 
additionally  the company expects to increase its inventory oods during its operations re alignment which will use approximately million of cash during the next fiscal year 
the company has a credit facility with bny financial corporation  an affiliate of the bank of new york  in an aggregate principal amount of million consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility enables the company to have up to million of revolving credit loans outstanding at any one time  limited by a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  subject to certain reserves 
subject to extension in certain instances  the scheduled maturity date of revolving credit loans is april   while the term loan is to be repaid through march   subject to mandatory repayments from disposition proceeds and insurance proceeds in certain circumstances 
due to the non recurring charge associated with the operations re alignment  the company would not have been in compliance with the tangible net worth convenant contained within the credit facility with bny financial corporation 
however  the company amended this facility on july  to adjust the tangible net worth convenant to million 
the company is in compliance with the amended terms of the credit facility with bny financial corporation

the company monitors the impact of inflation and attempts to adjust prices where market conditions permit 
inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations during any of the reported periods 
year tii has been implementing a program  the objective of which is to ensure that the company is not adversely affected by date discontinuity problems in computers  software and embedded processors during the transition from to and as a result of being a leap year 
date discontinuity occurs when time as expressed by a system or its software does not move forward successfully in line with true time 
the most commonly known manifestation of this occurs in systems that recognize years as two digits and  when moving from to  recognize as or fail altogether 
project scope the project covers information technology it systems  embedded processors  supply chain and business continuity 
it systems include central and network hardware  business systems and desktop hardware and software 
tii has minimal firm created software  the majority being industry standard packages  customized only where necessary 
embedded processors include  for example  plant instruments  laboratory equipment  control systems  data acquisition systems  vehicles and telecommunications 
supply chain considerations include liaison with suppliers and customers about our respective states of readiness for the year business continuity will consider all areas of the business and put in place contingency plans to mitigate the consequences arising from key risks identified 
the project covers all tii sites 
program work was divided into the following key stages inventory of hardware  software and embedded systems analysis of compliance defining and planning of solutions implementation and testing of solutions confirmation of major suppliers and customers state of readiness contingency planning 
steps  and are complete 
step is substantially complete  with the company s enterprise wide manufacturing and accounting system  operating systems  servers and the majority of personal computers brought into year compliance 
some testing and additional remediation programs are in progress and are expected to be completed by the end of october further testing will continue throughout the remaining months of in step  all current suppliers of goods and services have been approached and replies have been received from most suppliers 
key suppliers are the subject of more detailed scrutiny to monitor the progress of their program 
liaison with key customers is virtually completed 
the risk analysis relevant to the business which feeds into the contingency plan step covers internal processes  resource requirements and supply chain issues 
this program is progressing 
tii expects to be in full year readiness for critical systems by the end of the october and will continue to monitor all areas through january and beyond 
costs the estimated total cost of achieving year compliance is approximately  this figure is subject to ongoing review and  throughout the project life cycle  the business benefit of each remediation is reviewed  which may vary the amount the company is required to spend 
approximately  has been spent to date 
risks the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is an event that would disrupt the company s procurement process and impact production and product delivery to customers 
the company plans to build up inventory levels and request key suppliers to do the same 
in addition the company is working with its suppliers to minimize the possibility of such an event occurring and  through its contingency planning  to mitigate the consequences 
however  if the company or its suppliers  distributors or others with whom it conducts business are unable to identify and address the system issues related to the year risk on a timely basis  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in us dollar interest rates 
the interest payable under the company s credit agreement is principally between and basis points above the london interbank offered rate libor and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
historically  the effects of movements in the market interest rates have been immaterial to the consolidated operating results of the company 
the company requires foreign sales to be paid for in us currency  and generally requires such payments to be made in advance  by letter of credit or by us affiliates of the customer
