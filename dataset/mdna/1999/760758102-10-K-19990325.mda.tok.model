comparison of the years ended december   and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated results of operations 
all information has been retroactively restated to include the accounts and results of operations of family  cfc  unifirst and fpbb 
in addition  the company s operating results include the results of newberry bank since december  and banyan bank since january  the combination of merger transactions completed by the company and internal growth in and had the effect of increasing the company s assets in excess of since december  these merger transactions as well as internal growth transformed the bank  with total assets of million as a commercial bank operating in palm beach county  florida at december  to the largest commercial bank headquartered in florida operating in counties throughout the state at december  since the company s financial statements have been restated for the merger transactions accounted for as pooling of interests  certain operating trends such as the company s significant growth  are not reflected in the financial statements 
in addition  the company s core operating performance has been on a positive trend  even though net income has been negatively affected by merger related expenses 
the company s net loss for the year ended december  was million or loss per common share compared to net income of million or and  respectively  basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  includes merger related expenses and one time charges of million  net of taxes 
net income  excluding merger related expenses and one time charges decreased to million  compared to net income  excluding merger related expenses  of million  for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to an increase of million in provision for loan loss  offset by an increase of million in non interest income 
for the year ended december   merger related expenses associated with the acquisitions of fpbb and unifirst were approximately million  net of taxes  related to professional fees  fixed asset write downs and employee severance and retention payments and million  net of taxes  in additional merger related loan loss provision recorded to conform fpbb and unifirst s accounting and credit policies to those of the bank s 
additional charges of approximately million  net of taxes  related to asset write downs associated primarily with assets acquired from fpbb were recognized in the year ended december  the increase in the provision for loan losses in was recorded to provide for the inherent loan portfolio risks associated with the bank s recent merger transactions  increased commercial loan production and other factors associated with the bank s growth in commercial lending 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december   merger related expenses associated with the acquisitions of family and cfc consisted of approximately million  net of taxes  related to employee severance  professional fees and fixed asset write offs   net of taxes  for additional merger related loan loss provisions recorded to conform family and cfc s accounting policies to those of the bank s and  net of taxes  for other real estate owned write downs 
net income for the year ended december  was million or basic and diluted earnings per common share which includes a million  net of taxes  non recurring litigation settlement expense and a million  net of taxes  one time federal deposit insurance corporation fdic saving association insurance fund saif assessment to recapitalize the national saif see note 
net income  excluding merger related expenses  for the year ended december  increased to million  or and  respectively  basic and diluted earnings per common share compared to net income  excluding non recurring litigation settlement expense and the fdic saif assessment  of million or and  respectively  basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the reduction of million in the provision for loan losses and an increase of million in net interest income  offset by a reduction of million in non interest income and an increase of million in operating expenses 
the primary component of earnings for most financial institutions including the company is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income received on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is determined primarily by interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income net interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income increased approximately million offset by a rise of million in interest expense 
the increase in interest income is due to an increase of million in average interest earning assets offset by a decrease of basis points in asset yield for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest expense increased million due to an increase in interest bearing liabilities of million and an increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company s net interest margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the decline in market interest rates during the declining rate environment led to an increase in residential loan refinancings at lower interest rates without a corresponding decrease in the bank s cost of funds 
first bank s primary lending activities were in residential loans with aggressively competitive rates in the palm beach county market 
while the bank is continuing to offer residential lending products in all it s markets  the interest rates offered on these products are more in line with current market rates 
in addition  fpbb issued million of senior debentures due on june  senior debentures which resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to december  fpbb leveraged million of the debenture proceeds on a wholesale basis at lower margins which further reduced the percentage of net interest margin for the year ended december  compared to december  net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase of million in average interest earning assets while average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the net interest margin decreased to in from in primarily due to two leverage transactions totaling approximately million funded in and an increase in rates paid on certificate of deposits 
while leverage transaction strategies negatively impact net interest margin because the spreads on such transactions are less than the bank s overall spread  the effect on net interest income is positive and the transactions provide a means of capital leverage to the company 
interest income interest income increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in interest and fees on loans of million and a million increase in interest on investments offset by a decrease of million in interest on interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold 
interest and fees on loans increased million due to an increase of million in average loan balances outstanding offset by a decrease of million due to a decrease in loan yield of basis points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in loan yield is primarily due to increased residential loan refinancings and to a lesser extent refinacings of commercial loans business and real estate due to the declining rate environment in the prime interest rate decreased from at the beginning of the year to by year end 
first bank s primary lending activities were in residential loans with aggressively competitive rates in the palm beach county market 
in addition  commercial loans are typically adjustable rate loans and adjust with interest rate changes 
while the bank is continuing to offer residential lending products in all its markets  the interest rates on these products are more in line with current market rates than those formerly offered by first bank 
during  rates offered for commercial loans became increasingly competitive 
the increase in loans outstanding was primarily in residential real estate  commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the bank will continue its focus in commercial lending in and expects to decrease its residential loan outstandings 
average investments increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflecting a relatively flat investment yield during the comparison periods 
approximately million of investment purchases were funded with borrowings during and approximately million in investments were funded with the proceeds of the senior debentures in late the increase of million in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due to an increase of million in interest and fees on loans  a million increase in interest on interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and fed funds sold and a million increase in interest and dividends on investments 
the increase in interest and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase of million in average loan balances outstanding during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to the bank s success in attracting residential and commercial real estate loan customers through increased advertising and referrals and continued improvement in business conditions during the increase in interest on investments is due to the increase of million in average investments 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase of million in interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on borrowed money increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to an increase of approximately million in the average balance of borrowed money outstanding and increased million due to an increase in the rate paid on borrowed money of basis points 
fpbb issued million of senior debentures on june  which resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to december  approximately million of borrowings were used to fund investment purchases during the remaining increase in interest expense of approximately million is due primarily to the increases in average savings and certificate of deposit balances outstanding of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  savings account balances increased primarily as a result of fpbb offering a special tiered rate savings product during no special certificate of deposit programs were offered in the rate on interest bearing liabilities increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  primarily due to an increased rates paid on borrowed money and savings accounts 
the bank s strategy is to reduce the overall rates paid on deposits by decreasing the balances of certificates of deposit outstanding and increasing the balances of non interest bearing and low interest bearing deposits 
since the acquisition of fpbb  the bank has begun lowering interest rates offered in the former first bank offices on new and renewed certificate of deposit accounts to become more aligned with rates offered by commercial banks 
in addition  the bank is currently providing product and sales training to the former first bank branch personnel in an effort to convert these offices to commercial bank like branches 
as a result of this strategy  the bank anticipates approximately million in run off from the former first bank certificate of deposit balances during and expects continued certificate of deposit and potentially savings account balance run off through year in addition  the company purchased million of the senior debentures in an effort to further reduce the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the bank does not anticipate significant purchases of senior debentures in the future 
the increase in interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to the increase of million in interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on deposits increased million during compared to primarily due to the increase in average interest bearing deposits of million during the same period 
during  the largest change in interest bearing deposits was in certificates of deposit 
the average balance of certificates of deposits increased million during resulting in an increase of million in interest expense 
the increase in certificate of deposit in was due primarily to fpbb s opening of new branches during and the aggressive pricing offered by fpbb 
the remaining increase is due to the increase in borrowed money 
interest expense on borrowed money increased million due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of borrowed money of million 
the rate on interest bearing liabilities increased from to during the comparison periods primarily due to an increase in rates paid on borrowed money and deposits and an increased concentration in certificates of deposit 
the following table presents the average balances of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  interest income earned and interest expense incurred and weighted average yield or cost for the years ended december   and average balances were obtained from the best available daily or monthly data which in all cases approximated the average balances calculated on a daily basis

an evaluation of the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses is determined by management considering factors such as current economic conditions  the underlying quality of the loan portfolio including the bank s credit administration policy and procedures  loan concentrations  portfolio mix  prior loan loss experience  growth of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of issues related to the bank s recent merger transactions  increased commercial loan production  identified issues arising in the indirect automobile loan portfolio and merger related adjustments to conform unifirst and fpbb s credit policies to those of the bank 
merger related provision for loan losses recorded in the year ended december  was million 
an additional loan loss provision of million was recorded in the year ended december  by a pooled company fpbb with respect to issues arising in fpbb s indirect automobile loan portfolio 
the remaining provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  the additional increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily a result of increased commercial loan production  increased competition in the commercial lending market and increased risk in the loan portfolio as a result of merger integration issues associated with the merger transactions see further discussion below 
new commercial loan production increased from an average of approximately million per month during to approximately million per month during management believes these factors as well as the different underwriting policies of the merged institutions results in an increase in risks associated with the combined loan portfolios which resulted in management increasing the risk factors used in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes determining and applying relevant risk factors to the entire loan portfolio 
risk factors applied to the performing loan portfolio in the year ended december  are based on management s assessment of the risks in the loan portfolio considering current economic conditions  the bank s recent merger transactions  the increased commercial loan production  prior loan loss history and other factors associated with the bank s growth in commercial lending 
the following items related to the current portfolio characteristics were considered credit administration policy and underwriting procedures of acquired institutions as well as the bank s  net growth in the commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios of million or during and increase in non performing commercial real estate and commercial business loans from million at december  to million at december in addition to the factors listed above  the impact of the recent merger transactions and the increased competition in the lending environment during were considered in management s analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank s merger transactions resulted in the integration of the bank and the pooled companies during integration of the company included the elimination of substantially all senior and middle management of the pooled companies 
management believes the loss of those senior and middle management positions as well as other restructure and integration issues resulted in increased inherent risks in the loan portfolios due to the loss of customer and automobile dealer relationships  the lack of continuity of processing and collections procedures  the loss of specific knowledge of the origination of the loan portfolios and other issues resulting from the transition into one combined company 
the competition for loans from other financial institutions intensified during which resulted in certain financial institutions lowering underwriting standards as well as lowering interest rates offered on loans 
while the bank did not significantly ease any requirements in its underwriting policies  a lowering of underwriting standards in the industry as well as among the bank s local competitors was noted during consideration was given to this increased competition by management in its assessment of the risks in the combined loan portfolios 
the systematic method prescribed in the bank s loan policy  which includes procedures for early detection of potential problem loans  is consistently used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and also considers the characteristics of the loan portfolio  historical charge off history  current economic conditions  as well as other relevant factors 
as a result of the analysis  management determined an increase to the allowance for loan losses was necessary and increased the risk factors applied to performing loans in its quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
risk factors applied to the loan portfolio in prior years were based primarily on the bank s three year loss history considering the portfolio s characteristics 
management believes the new risk factors are more relevant to the current portfolio than the risk factors applied in prior years 
furthermore  the average net charge offs to average loans is significantly higher for the three years ended december  of 
compared to 
and  respectively  for the three years ended december  and non performing loans are carried at fair value based on the most recent information available 
risk factors as prescribed in the bank s loan policy are applied to the remaining book balances of classified loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december   the following risk factors were applied to the carrying value of each classified loan which is consistent with prior years i substandard at  ii doubtful at and iii loss charged off at 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans increased from at december  to at december  the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans increased from at december  to approximately at december  the lower allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and total loans at december  is primarily a result of significant charge offs primarily related to fpbb s indirect portfolio taken during in accordance with the bank s asset classification policy  non performing loans loans contractually past due days or more are recorded at the lesser of the loan balance or estimated fair value of the collateral underlying the loan  for collateral dependent loans  or the net present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
as a result  any expected losses from loans identified at december  as non performing have been recognized by the bank and should not have a future impact on the allowance for loan losses unless the condition of the loan further deteriorates 
the provision for loan losses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  the bank recorded  to the provision for loan losses in connection with merger transactions to conform family and county s accounting and credit policies regarding loan valuations to those of the bank s 
the increased provision for loan losses recorded in the year ended december  was primarily a result of fpbb s losses related to the indirect automobile lending program 
fpbb began originating indirect automobile loans in large volumes in august and continued this practice through september during september  fpbb ceased its originations of indirect automobile loans 
higher delinquencies and charge offs resulting from fpbb s indirect lending program occurring in the quarter ended june  as the significant credit problems did not surface until that time 
the provisions were determined by fpbb by projecting charge offs based on the latest repossession activity and recovery rates 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  included a charge of million related primarily to fpbb s consumer lending 
the provision for loan losses related to fpbb s indirect automobile lending portfolio decreased in because fpbb discontinued its indirect lending as of september  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans decreased from at december  to at december  primarily due to the significant net charge offs of million taken in related to fpbb s indirect loan portfolio 
non interest income non interest income increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of million  increases in gain on sale of loans of million  increase in gains on investments available for sale of and increases of million in other income 
non interest income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase of million in service charges on deposit accounts  an increase of  in the gain on sale of investments available for sale and an increase of million in other income offset by a decrease of million in gains on sale of loans 
service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased volume in transaction accounts 
non interest bearing average account balances increased approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  certain deposit fees were increased in march of contributing slightly to the increase in service charges on deposits 
service charges on deposit accounts increased approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  average non interest bearing account balances increased approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which is the primary reason for the increased level of service charges 
gain on sales of loans 
gain on sale of loans increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the volume of loans sold 
during  loans with principal balances of approximately million were sold as compared to million in the prior period 
the increase in loans sold is due to million of fixed and adjustable rate loans sold by fpbb during no significant loan sales were made by fpbb during in addition  the level of gains is dependent on market interest rates at the time the loan is sold and if the loan is sold servicing released or servicing retained 
gain on sale of loans decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an decrease in the volume of loans sold and a decrease in the gains realized on the sales 
during  approximately million loans were sold as compared to million in net gain on sale of investments available for sale 
gain on sale of investments available for sale increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in the volume of investments available for sale sold and in the gains realized on the sale of those investments 
during approximately million investments available for sale were sold as compared to approximately million during gain on sale of investments available for sale increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  although the volume of investments available for sale declined to million from million in the prior period the gains realized on those sales increased

other income increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to increased loan servicing income  purchased accounts receivable income and miscellaneous income

the increase is primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment and communications expenses 
employee compensation and benefits  excluding one time charges related to the fpbb merger of  increased  for the year ended december  the increase in compensation and benefits is due to the addition of seven new branch locations in  the addition of staff in the credit training and loan servicing departments in late the establishment of the trust and investment services division in mid and a  increase in esop expense  offset by decreases of approximately million related to the accrual associated with the company s stock appreciation rights sars and cost savings realized as a result of the mergers with family on june  and county on december  sars expense decreased as a result of postponing the initial vesting and exercisable dates in order to restore the purpose of the sar grants of providing long term incentive for the board members

the decrease in income tax expenses related to the decrease in income before income taxes was offset by a decrease in the effective tax benefit rate for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the effective rate or a lower effective tax benefit rate was due to non deductible merger expenses incurred in income tax expense increased million for the year ended december  due to increase of million in income before income taxes as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the increase of net interest income after provision for loan losses of million offset by the increase of million in non interest expense 
the increase in income taxes for year ended december  can also be attributed to the increased effective tax rate for the tax impact of the non deductible merger related expenses was partially offset by a reduction of million in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with county 
the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the year ended december  liquidity the company s liquid assets consist primarily of interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and marketable securities 
considerations in managing the company s liquidity position include scheduled cash flows from existing assets  contingencies and liabilities  as well as projected liquidity needs arising from approved extensions of credit 
furthermore  liquidity position is monitored daily by management to maintain a level of liquidity conducive to efficient operations and is continuously evaluated as part of the asset liability management process 
the company s cash inflows for the year ended december  consist primarily of amounts generated from the sale of loans and investments available for sale  the collection of loan principal payments  deposits and principal payments on securities 
uses of cash consist of originations of loans and purchases of investments available for sale and decreases in fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
primary sources of borrowings include advances from the fhlb and borrowings under repurchase agreements 
access to funds from depositors is affected by the rate the bank pays on certificates of deposit and convenience and service provided to transaction based account holders 
the rate the bank pays on certificates of deposit is dependent on rates paid by other financial institutions within the bank s area 
the bank manages the cash inflows and outflows from certificates of deposit by increasing or decreasing the rates offered in its market area 
the company s sources of liquidity are impacted by various matters beyond the control of the company 
scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds while loan prepayments and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by the availability of loans for sale  general market demand and other unforeseen market conditions 
the company s ability to borrow at attractive rates is affected by its credit ratings and other market conditions 
in line with the bank s strategy to increase transaction account balances and decrease certificate of deposit account balances in an effort to lower the bank s cost of deposits  demand  now  money market and savings account balances increased million excluding the assumption of newberry and household deposits while certificate of deposit account balances declined million during the year ended december  management expects a larger decline in certificate of deposit account balances during due to the lowering of former first bank and unifirst certificates of deposit rates to become more aligned with the commercial bank pricing offered by the bank 
management anticipates growth in the transaction account balances to fund the certificate of deposit balance run off 
management also anticipates a temporary increase in liquidity requirements during the fourth quarter as a result of customer reactions to year issues 
management has not yet determined the extent of the increase in liquidity requirements as a result of year issues but is currently assessing the issue as part of the year project 
the bank will likely fund the increased liquidity through short term borrowings 
in order to manage the uncertainty inherent in its sources of funds  the company continually evaluates alternate sources of funds and maintains and develops diversity and flexibility in the number of such sources 
the effect of a decline in any one source of funds generally can be offset by use of an alternative source although potentially at a different cost to the company 
capital compliance the bank and the company are in compliance with regulatory capital requirements at december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the bank and the company  as a bank holding company  are subject to the capital requirements of the frb 
under frb guidelines  bank holding companies such as the company are required to maintain capital based on risk adjusted assets 
under risk based capital guidelines  categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk require more capital than assets with lower risk 
in addition to balance sheet assets  bank holding companies are required to maintain capital  on a risk adjusted basis  to support certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments 
the frb standards classify capital into two tiers  tier i and total 
tier i risk based capital consists of common stockholders equity  noncumulative and cumulative bank holding companies only perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests  less goodwill and deposit intangibles 
total risk based capital consists of tier i capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan losses  hybrid capital instruments  term subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock 
in addition to risk based capital requirements  the frb requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier i capital to total average assets 
total assets for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the frb determines should be deducted from tier i capital 
the frb requires banks and bank holding companies to maintain tier i and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and a tier i leverage capital ratio of 
see item business certain regulatory considerations impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial information presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
financial condition consolidated total assets increased approximately million or to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase in assets is partially due to the million net asset purchases net of cash paid of newberry and the household branches during the remaining asset increase is a result of million increase in deposits  excluding deposits acquired from the acquisition of newberry and the household branch transactions  and million increase in other liabilities offset by decreases of million in fhlb advances  million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  million in advances to borrowers for taxes and insurance  million in senior debentures outstanding and million in total shareholders equity 
investments increased million and loans net and loans held for sale increased million while cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
the increase in loans was partially attributable to million in loans acquired in the newberry and household branch transactions 
other assets increased approximately million at december  compared to december  primarily due to increase of million in income taxes receivable  million in accrued interest receivable  million in net deferred tax asset  million in deferred merger charges related to the northside bank acquisition which closed on february  and other asset increases due to increased size of the company 
advances to borrowers for taxes and insurance decreased at december  compared to december  because the balance includes balances of fpbb as of september  due to the timing of tax and insurance payment disbursements  balances at september are significantly higher each year than balances at december approximately million of senior debentures were repurchased by the company during at the prevailing market price 
other liabilities decreased  from december  to december  the decrease of million in shareholders equity at december  compared to december  is due to million net loss for the year ended december   dividend payments of million paid by the company and dividend payments of million paid by a pooled company fpbb during the thirteen months ended october  offset by million appreciation  net of taxes  in investments available for sale  million increase due to exercise of stock options  million increase associated with esop and rrp amortization and million  net income of pooled companies for the three months ended december  excluded from results of operations due to different year ends of pooled companies 
year matters the bank relies heavily on information technology it systems which are primarily provided by third party vendors and other systems and facilities such as telecommunications  utilities  electronic clearinghouses and building access control systems to conduct its business 
the bank also has business relationships with other financial institutions  regulators and customers who are also reliant on it and embedded systems to conduct their businesses 
the bank utilizes and is dependent upon a third party vendor for its primary data processing functions 
the bank also utilizes other purchased software packages which operate on in house computer networks 
the bank faces the risk that one or more of its critical service providers will not be able to provide services to the bank due to the third party s inability to resolve its own year issues  including those associated with its own external relationships 
state of readiness in  the bank s electronic data processing committee the edp committee started work on the bank s year project 
the edp committee is comprised of members from each area of the bank 
the edp committee developed and is currently executing a comprehensive plan designed to ensure the bank s mission critical it systems and mission critical service providers are year compliant 
the bank s plan consists of five phases awareness phase  to define the year issue and obtain senior management and board of directors support  inventory phase  to identify all it systems and service providers and assign risk ratings in accordance with its potential business impact  available alternatives and cost of substitution  assessment phase  to evaluate the identified mission critical systems  including those systems provided by third party vendors  for year functionality and readiness  remediation phase  to replace or upgrade inventoried items to ensure year compliance and testing and certification phase  to test all remediated systems including testing with vendors  to ensure successful operation in the post environment 
in addition  the bank s year plan includes assessing the impact of the year issue on borrowers ability to repay loans 
as of december   the bank had completed the awareness  inventory and assessment phases and has substantially completed the remediation phase 
the testing phase has begun and the majority of the testing is scheduled to be substantially complete by march  the bank is utilizing both internal and external resources to upgrade  replace and test hardware  software and third party vendor programs 
through formal communication  the bank s primary data processing vendor and the majority of other critical vendors have indicated their it systems are or will be year compliant and tested before year the bank has also contacted all of its significant commercial loan customers to determine the borrower s ability and readiness to become year compliant 
approximately of the loan customers contacted have responded and the bank has not identified any significant issues with those customers 
the bank anticipates completing all the phases within six months but no later than october  year costs year expenses primarily include costs associated with internal and external personnel  upgrade packages and disposal of non compliant hardware and software 
to date  the bank has not incurred any significant expenses and does not expect to incur any significant expenses other than internal personnel resources associated with the year project 
costs to purchase new compliant hardware and software are estimated to be approximately million  which will be capitalized 
the cost of the year project will be funded through operating cash flows 
while management does not anticipate the cost of the year project to have a material impact on the company s financial condition  operations or cash flows  the project is not yet complete and is dependent on third parties 
risks and contingency if the bank s or other third party vendors fail to resolve year issues by december   potential consequences would include  among other possibilities  the inability to accurately and timely process withdrawals  deposits and payments  update customers accounts  process financial information  bill customers  accommodate customer s financial needs  determine or meet liquidity requirements or report accurate data to management  customers  shareholders  regulators and others as well as business interruptions or branch closings  financial losses  reputational harm  increased scrutiny by regulators and litigation related to year issues 
the bank is attempting to limit the potential impact of the year by monitoring the progress of its year project and those of its critical vendors and by developing contingency plans 
there can be no assurance that the bank will be completely successful in its efforts to resolve year issues 
any critical unresolved year issues at the bank or its critical vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the bank has begun developing comprehensive contingency plans designed to ensure the continuity of critical business processes before and after december  the contingency plans will include reasonably likely year failure scenarios for its critical business processes  procedures designed to reduce the impact on the bank and methods of returning to normal operations 
the bank expects contingency planning to be substantially complete by july  the foregoing year discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements  including without limitation  anticipated costs and the dates by which the bank expects to complete certain actions  are based on management s best current estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third parties and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability to identify and remediate all relevant systems  results of year parties who are service providers  suppliers or customers of the company  unanticipated system costs  the adequacy of and ability to develop and implement contingency plans and similar uncertainties 
the forward looking statements made in the foregoing year discussion speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution holding company  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those with short term maturities 
all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
accordingly  interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
based on the nature of the bank s operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s real estate portfolio  concentrated primarily within palm beach  martin  broward  dade and lee counties in florida  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the operations of the bank are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature or reprice in specified periods 
management of interest rate sensitivity involves matching the maturity and repricing dates of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities in an effort to manage the impact of fluctuating interest rates on net interest margins 
the asset liability committee alco has the responsibility for the management of interest rate risk 
operating within risk tolerance levels approved by the board of directors  the alco meets at least quarterly to establish  communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management procedures 
the purpose of the alco is to monitor the volume and mix of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities consistent with the company s overall liquidity  capital  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the bank utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the percentage of financial assets and liabilities in the company s existing portfolio that are subject to repricing within specific time periods 
in addition  the bank measures the interest rate sensitivity of its budgeted growth in financial assets and liabilities 
these differences  known as interest sensitivity gaps  are usually calculated cumulatively for blocks of time 
the model quantifies the potential changes in future earnings which is measured by the effects of various interest rate changes on net income over the ensuing one and two year periods 
the company manages its interest rate risk exposure by limiting the amount of long term fixed rate loans it holds for investment  increasing emphasis on shorter term loans for portfolio  increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of long term and short term borrowings and deposits and or purchasing commitments to sell loans 
the following table presents the company s exposure to interest rate risk at december  december  one year to to over or less years years years total dollars in thousands total interest earning assets      total interest bearing liabilities      interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets in preparing the table above  certain assumptions have been made with regard to loan prepayments and withdrawals of transaction account deposits 
loan prepayment rates are based upon market consensus estimates for similar securities 
money market and savings account balances are assumed to reprice with a lag of between three through twelve months to any change in market rates  and are included in one year or less 
now account deposits are assumed to be non interest sensitive and are included in one year or less 
all other assets and liabilities have been repriced based on the earlier of repricing or contractual maturity 
the above assumptions are annual percentages based on the latest available assumptions and on remaining balances and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced by the company 
moreover  certain shortcomings are inherent in the analysis presented by the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods for repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of or lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition to the above  the bank was committed to fund million in new loans and million in construction loans in process at december  these loans and commitments are largely protected from interest rate fluctuations because they are either adjustable rate loans or are fixed rate loans which the bank has obtained commitments to sell in the secondary market 
this relationship is not linear or consistent with other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities on the company s balance sheet and management uses computer modeling in its efforts to reduce the effects that interest rate fluctuations have on income 
the current potential changes in future earnings relating to financial assets and liabilities as of december  are as follows potential change in future earnings interest rate change in basis points the most significant assumptions used in this simulation relate primarily to the repricing rates of demand and other non maturity deposits and loan prepayment rates 
money market and savings deposit accounts are assumed to have the following lag characteristics in an increasing rate environment the bank will recognize a basis point increase at nine months and an additional basis point increase at twelve months following an increase in the market rate 
now accounts are considered to be non interest rate sensitive in an increasing rate environment 
money market  savings and now accounts are assumed to have the following characteristics in a decreasing rate environment the bank will recognize a basis point decrease at three months and an additional basis point decrease at nine months following a decrease in the market rate 
loan prepayment rates are based upon market consensus estimates for similar securities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the simulation presented by the above table 
for example  certain financial assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods for repricing that may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the potential changes in future earnings shown above are within the bank s interest rate risk policy limits
