the company s business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the christmas holiday  back to school season  and other periods when schools are not in session 
the christmas holiday season remains the company s single most important selling season 
the company believes  however  that the importance of the summer vacation and back to school seasons which affect operating results in the second and third quarters  respectively and  to a lesser extent  the spring break season which affects operating results in the first quarter  reduces somewhat the company s dependence on the christmas holiday selling season 
furthermore  summer vacation  spring break and the back to school season take place at somewhat different times in different parts of the country  spreading the impact of these events on the company s sales over a longer period

the company expects the average total costs associated with opening a store will be approximately the same in fiscal pre opening costs are expensed in the period in which the store opens 
the actual costs that the company will incur in connection with opening future stores cannot be predicted with precision because such costs will vary based upon  among other things  geographic location  the size of the stores and the extent of the build out required at the selected sites 
initial inventory requirements vary at new stores depending on the season and current merchandise trends 
to accommodate its planned expansion in fiscal and beyond  the company has leased a larger building to expand the capacity of its headquarters office and merchandise distribution facility 
construction of the offices and installation of the distribution equipment commenced in february the company presently plans to move from its existing facility into the new facility early in the summer of presently  the estimated cost of construction  equipment  fixtures and furniture is approximately to million

the company is presently evaluating future long term management information system needs and the corresponding hardware and software upgrades at its stores and its office and distribution center that may be necessary 
the scope and timing of such upgrades as well as the specific hardware and software have not yet been fully identified and evaluated 
however  the company presently estimates that the expenditures for management information system upgrades in fiscal and fiscal will be approximately million for both years combined  which is substantially greater than such historical annual expenditures 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and planned expansion through the next months

year compliance the year issue exists because many computer applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than that have the year this could result in the computer shutting down or performing incorrect computations  leading to disruptions in normal business processing 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
during  the company completed its assessment of all critical systems and developed a plan to bring these systems into compliance 
the company has obtained information from the vendors for its integrated store  merchandising  distribution and financial systems as to required modifications and timing of those modifications to ensure that the systems will be year compliant 
these efforts began in mid and are scheduled to be completed in the second and third quarters of fiscal early in  the hardware for these systems was tested and as required  replacement hardware and operating systems were installed 
the company s plans call for the testing of the vendor s revised software in first and second quarters of fiscal  and full implementation during the second and third quarters of fiscal the cost of the company s year problem initiatives is expected to be less than the company does not have systems that interface directly with significant third party vendors and has queried its significant suppliers of merchandise and services that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could have a material impact on the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
the company has not yet completed its contingency plan with respect to a worst case scenario in the event of non compliance by external agents 
the company does not presently believe that an interruption in the supply of merchandise would have a significant adverse impact on its operations since it purchases merchandise from over vendors  none of which historically supplies more than approximately of the company s annual purchases 
however  the company may increase inventory levels of certain merchandise late in calendar to offset the risk that certain vendors may be adversely affected by year issues 
the company presently uses united parcel service ups to ship merchandise to its stores 
the company has contacted ups regarding year compliance and received written confirmation from ups that ups believes it will be fully compliant by december  while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company
