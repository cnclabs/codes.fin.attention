item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding item selected financial data and the company s financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in items and business and properties included elsewhere herein 
overview the company generates revenues primarily from the sale and financing of vacation intervals  including upgraded intervals 
additional revenues are generated from management fees from the management clubs  lease income from sampler sales  and utility operations 
the company recognizes management fee income as the lesser of of revenue or of net income of the management clubs  however  if the company does not receive of each management club s gross revenues  such deficiency is deferred for payment in succeeding years  subject again to the net income limitation 
the company recognizes vacation interval sales revenues on the accrual basis 
a sale is recognized after a binding sales contract has been executed  the buyer has made a down payment of at least  and the statutory rescission period has expired 
if all criteria are met except that construction is not substantially complete  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  the portion of revenue applicable to costs incurred  as compared to total estimated construction and direct selling costs  is recognized in the period of sale 
the remaining amount is deferred and recognized as vacation interval sales in future periods as the remaining costs are incurred 
at december   million of vacation interval sales transactions were deferred as the minimum down payment had not been received 
the company accounts for these transactions utilizing the deposit method 
under this method  the sale is not recognized  a receivable is not recorded  and inventory is not relieved 
any cash received is carried as a liability until the sale can be recognized 
when these types of sales are cancelled without a refund  deposits forfeited are recognized as income 
when deposits are ultimately recognized as sales  the interest portion is recognized as interest income 
the company accounts for uncollectible notes by recording a provision to its allowance for uncollectible notes at the time revenue is recognized 
the company classifies the components of the provision for uncollectible notes into the following three categories based on the nature of the item credit losses  customer returns  and customer releases customer releases represent voluntary cancellations of properly recorded sales transactions which in the opinion of management are consistent with the maintenance of overall customer goodwill 
the provision for uncollectible notes pertaining to credit losses  customer returns  and customer releases is classified in the consolidated statement of income in provision for uncollectible notes  vacation interval sales  and operating  general and administrative expenses  respectively 
the company sets the provision for uncollectible notes at an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level which management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the notes 
when inventory is returned to the company  any unpaid notes receivable balances are charged against the previously established bad debt reserves net of the amount at which the vacation interval is restored to inventory  which is the lower of the historical cost basis or market value of the vacation interval 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of resorts including land  construction costs  furniture  interest  and taxes are capitalized and included in inventory 
vacation interval inventory is segregated into three ratings based on customer demand  with greater costs apportioned to higher value ratings 
as vacation intervals are sold  these costs are deducted from inventory on a specific identification basis 
vacation intervals may be reacquired as a result of i foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  ii trade in associated with the purchase of an upgraded vacation interval  or iii the company s ongoing program to reacquire vacation intervals owned but not actively used by silverleaf owners 
vacation intervals reacquired are recorded in inventory at the lower of their original cost or market value 
vacation intervals which have been reacquired are relieved from inventory on a specific identification basis when resold 
inventory acquired prior to through the company s program to reacquire vacation intervals owned but not actively used by silverleaf owners has a significantly lower average cost basis than recently constructed inventory  contributing significantly to historical operating margins 
new inventory added through the company s construction and acquisition programs has a higher average cost than the company s pre inventory 
accordingly  cost of sales has increased and will continue to increase as sales of new inventory increases relative to overall sales 
the company recognizes interest income as earned 
to the extent interest payments become delinquent  the company ceases recognition of the interest income until collection is probable 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information for the company 
years ended december  as a percentage of total revenues vacation interval sales sampler sales total sales interest income management fee income other income total revenues as a percentage of gross vacation interval sales cost of vacation interval sales sales and marketing provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of interest income interest expense as a percentage of total revenues operating  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and operating expenses versus revenues in were million  representing a million or increase over revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in sales of vacation intervals and a million increase in interest income 
the strong increase in vacation interval revenues primarily resulted from increased sales at existing resorts and sales at three new resorts  timber creek near st 
louis  missouri  and fox river near chicago  illinois  each of which opened sales offices in the fourth quarter of  and oak n spruce near boston  massachusetts  which opened a sales office in the second quarter of in and  sales were reduced by million and million  respectively  for cancellations related to customer returns ie  customers that failed to make their first installment payment 
in  the number of vacation intervals sold  exclusive of upgraded vacation intervals  increased to  from  in  the average price per interval increased to  from  total interval sales for included  biennial intervals counted as  vacation intervals compared to  biennial intervals counted as vacation intervals in the company also experienced increased sales of upgraded intervals at the existing resorts through the continued implementation of marketing and sales programs focused on selling upgraded intervals to the company s existing vacation interval owners 
in  the number of upgraded vacation intervals sold was  at an average price of  compared to  upgraded vacation intervals sold in at an average price of  in addition  vacation interval sales at existing resorts increased as a result of enhanced telemarketing capacity  arising from investments in computer and automated dialing technology 
sampler sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase resulted from increased sales of overnight samplers offered at new resorts  offset by an increase in biennial interval sales which are an alternative to the sampler program 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase resulted from an million increase in notes receivable  net of allowance for uncollectible notes  due to increased sales  as well as interest income generated from the proceeds of the debt and equity offerings completed on april  interest income from short term investments  primarily from the proceeds from public offerings prior to their utilization  increased from  in to  in management fee income increased to million in from million in the increase in management fee income was primarily the result of greater net income from the management clubs due to higher dues income resulting from an increased membership base  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
other income consists of water and utilities income  condominium rental income  and miscellaneous items 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of a  claims settlement included in other income in cost of sales as a percentage of gross vacation interval sales increased to in from in as the company continues to deplete its inventory of low cost vacation intervals acquired primarily in and  the company s sales mix has shifted to more recently constructed units  which were built at a higher average cost per vacation interval 
hence  the cost of sales as a percentage of vacation interval sales has increased compared to sales and marketing costs as a percentage of gross vacation interval sales increased to for the year ended december  from for this increase is due primarily to the implementation of new marketing programs  start up costs in recently opened markets or markets yet to open where sales have not yet reached mature levels to offset costs  and the deferred sales recognition associated with sales at resorts under construction whereby only the direct sales commissions costs related to such sales have been similarly deferred 
the provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales decreased to in from in this is the result of improvements in the company s collection efforts  including increased staffing  improved collections software  the implementation of a program through which delinquent loans are assumed by existing owners with a consistent payment history  and an increase in receivables related to upgrade sales  which typically represent better performing accounts  resulting in fewer delinquencies 
the company anticipates that it will decrease the provision for uncollectible notes to in operating  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined to in from in the decrease is the result of the company s ability to increase sales without proportionate increases in overhead 
overall  operating  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase in corporate salaries and additional costs resulting from growth and the company s publicly traded status effective june in  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to from in overall  depreciation and amortization expense increased million from  primarily due to investments in a new automated dialer  telephone system  and central marketing facility 
interest expense as a percentage of interest income decreased to for the year ended december  from in while interest expense increased million  or  overall compared to  this increase was not proportionate with the increase in interest income previously discussed 
this was due primarily to the payment of indebtedness with proceeds from the company s equity and debt offerings in the second quarter of  which resulted in lower effective interest rates and lower average balances on outstanding notes payable and capital lease obligations  offset by the interest expense generated by the senior subordinated notes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a result of the above mentioned operating results 
income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to in versus in this increase resulted from an increase in state income taxes  primarily due to additional operations commencing in illinois  missouri  and massachusetts 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a result of the above mentioned operating results 
versus revenues in were million  representing a million or increase over revenues of million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in sales of vacation intervals and a million increase in interest income 
in and  sales were reduced by million and million  respectively  for customer returns ie  customers that failed to make their first installment payment 
in  the number of vacation intervals sold  exclusive of sales of upgraded vacation intervals  increased to  from  in and the average price per unit increased to  from  the increase in vacation interval sales resulted from the company s modernized electronic telemarketing programs  increased sales force  and enhanced lead generation methods 
the increase in average price per interval resulted from the company s increased sales of higher value rated intervals 
in addition to increases in sales of vacation intervals  the company increased revenues generated from sales of upgraded intervals at its existing resorts through the continued implementation of marketing and sales programs focused on selling such intervals to silverleaf owners 
in  sampler sales decreased to million compared to million in the decrease resulted from the company s marketing of biennial intervals as an alternative to the sampler program 
interest income increased to million in from million in this increase resulted from a million increase in notes receivable  net of allowance for uncollectible notes  due to increased sales 
management fee income increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of greater silverleaf club net income due to higher dues income from an increased membership base 
other income increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to usage fees from the company s newly remodeled golf course at holiday hills and higher water and sewer income due to the addition of two new utility operations 
additionally  the company recovered  from a lawsuit in cost of sales as a percentage of gross vacation interval sales increased to in from in cost of sales for was lower primarily as a result of the sale of low cost inventory acquired by the company in and through its program to reacquire vacation intervals owned but not actively used by silverleaf owners 
the number of intervals acquired from silverleaf owners in was as compared to approximately  in additionally  the company continues to deplete its inventory of low cost intervals 
as a result of these factors and the company s construction program to build new inventory  the cost of sales percentage increased in sales and marketing costs as a percentage of gross vacation interval sales declined to in from in this decline is due primarily to the efficiencies resulting from the company s telemarketing and sales force areas and economies of scale 
the provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales decreased to for from in  reflecting an increased focus on collection efforts for notes receivable 
the improvement can also be attributed to an increase in receivables relating to upgrade sales which typically represent better performing accounts  resulting in fewer delinquencies 
operating  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined to in from in due to efficiencies realized from higher sales volume 
overall  operating  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in corporate salaries and additional costs incurred as a result of the company s publicly traded status effective june depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue declined to in from in overall  depreciation and amortization expense increased  from  primarily due to investments in a new automated dialer  telephone system  and central marketing facility 
interest expense as a percentage of interest income declined to in from in this decrease was due to lower borrowing cost during the second half of  mostly as a result of payment of indebtedness with proceeds of the company s initial public offering in june income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in from million in as a result of the above mentioned operating results 
income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes remained relatively unchanged at in versus in net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the above mentioned operating results and losses from discontinued operations of  in liquidity and capital resources sources of cash 
the company generates cash primarily from the cash received on the sale of vacation intervals  the financing of customer notes receivables from silverleaf owners  management fees  sampler sales  and resort and utility operations 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
during the years ended december  and  the company s operating activities reflected a use of cash of million and million  respectively 
the company typically receives a down payment on sales of vacation intervals and finances the remainder by receipt of a seven to ten year customer promissory note 
the company generates cash from the financing of customer notes receivable by i borrowing at an advance rate of of eligible customer notes receivable and ii from the spread between interest received on customer notes receivable and interest paid on related borrowings 
because the company uses significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation intervals  but collects cash on customer notes receivable over a seven to ten year period  borrowing against receivables has historically been a necessary part of normal operations 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during  the million in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes  bearing an interest rate of  due and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  net of debt issuance costs of million in april the company s revolving credit facilities provide for loans of up to million 
at december   approximately million of principal and interest related to advances under the credit facilities was outstanding 
of this amount  million  million  and million matures in   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the weighted average cost of funds for all borrowings  including the senior subordinated debt  was 
customer defaults have significant impact on cash available to the company from financing customer notes receivable in that notes more than days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  the company in effect must repay borrowings against such notes 
for regular federal income tax purposes  the company reports substantially all of the vacation interval sales it finances under the installment method 
under this method  income on sales of vacation intervals is not recognized until cash is received  either in the form of a down payment or as installment payments on customer notes receivable 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest will be imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the related tax is paid 
if the company is otherwise not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense which would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method as the interest expense is not estimable 
in addition  the company is subject to current alternative minimum tax amt as a result of the deferred income which results from the installment sales treatment 
payment of amt reduces the future regular tax liability attributable to vacation interval sales  and creates a deferred tax asset 
in  the internal revenue service approved a change in the method of accounting for installment sales effective as of january  as a result  the company s alternative minimum taxable income for through was or will be increased each year by approximately million per year for the pre adjustment  which will result in the company paying substantial additional federal and state taxes in those years 
the company s net operating loss carryforwards  which also may be used to offset installment sales income  expire beginning in through realization of the deferred tax asset arising from net operating losses is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards and other factors 
uses of cash 
investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash because of loans to customers in connection with the company s vacation interval sales  capital additions  and property acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities increased significantly in each period primarily due to significant increases in customer notes receivable and the acquisition of the fox river  timber creek  and oak n spruce resorts and the las vegas and galveston sites in  and the acquisition of the crown resorts  the atlanta  kansas city  and philadelphia sites  and a second parcel of land in galveston in the company acquired the fox river and timber creek resorts in august for million  the site in las vegas  nevada  in november for million  one tract of the galveston property in december for  and the oak n spruce resort in massachusetts in december for million 
the company acquired a second tract of the galveston property in february for million  the crown resorts in may for million  the kansas city site in september for million  the philadelphia site in december for million  and various tracts of the atlanta property throughout the fourth quarter of for million 
also  in the third and fourth quarter of  the company reacquired  shares of its common stock for approximately million 
operating and investing activities also use cash because the company requires funds to construct infrastructure  amenities  and additional units at the existing resorts and new resorts  to acquire property for future resort development  and to support current operations 
the company evaluates sites for additional new resorts or acquisitions on an ongoing basis 
as of december   the company had construction commitments of approximately million 
certain debt agreements include restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends based on minimum levels of net income and cash flow 
the company believes that with respect to its current operations and capital commitments  its borrowing capacity under certain existing or renegotiated third party lending agreements  together with cash generated from operations and future borrowings  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the year ended december  however  depending upon conditions in capital and other financial markets  and other factors including the company s growth  development  and expansion plans  the company may from time to time consider the issuance of other debt  equity  or collateralized mortgage backed securities  the proceeds of which would be used to finance future acquisitions  refinance debt  finance mortgage receivables  or for other purposes 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  have fixed or variable rate interest  and may be subject to such terms as management deems prudent 
inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenues  operating income  and net income during any of the company s three most recent fiscal years 
however  to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be affected as well as the rates the company charges on its customer notes receivable

year compliance many of the world s computer systems record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could potentially lead to disruptions in the company s operations 
the company has conducted a review of its information technology it systems currently utilized and is in the process of identifying and assessing non it systems in order to determine its potential year deficiencies 
this study included reviewing all applicable reports  files  inquiry screens  maintenance screens  batch programs  software  hardware  and other interactive applications 
non it systems are generally more difficult to assess because they often contain embedded technology that may be subject to year problems 
in completing its assessment  the company has identified several primary computer systems that are currently not year compliant 
each of these computer systems and its year compliance status are discussed below marketing system the current marketing system requires modifications in order to be year compliant 
these modifications are anticipated to be completed during the second quarter of sales and credit system the sales and credit system will need to be redeveloped in order to be year compliant 
the redevelopment of the sales and credit system is scheduled to be completed by june accounts receivable system the accounts receivable system will need to be redeveloped in order to be year compliant 
the redevelopment of the accounts receivable system is scheduled to be completed by june inventory system the inventory system is currently being redeveloped to be year compliant  among other enhancements 
the redevelopment of the inventory system is scheduled to be completed by june finance administration system the finance administration system will need to be redeveloped in order to be year compliant 
the redevelopment of the finance administration system is scheduled to be completed by june sales commissions system the sales commissions system is currently being redeveloped to be year compliant  among other enhancements 
the redevelopment of the sales commissions system is scheduled to be completed by june predictive dialer software the company s predictive dialer software is scheduled to be year compliant with an upgrade scheduled for the second quarter of full implementation of all programs is anticipated to be completed by june in the redevelopment phase of each module  the system being modified will be tested by the appropriate programmers to ensure proper handling of dates 
test procedures have already been developed as well as a complete test environment 
the necessary personnel and processing resources have been determined and assigned to the appropriate projects 
all major redeveloped systems will be run parallel with the existing systems to ensure completeness and accuracy 
all redeveloped systems will be verified and accepted by the appropriate users prior to eliminating the existing systems 
any other primary computer programs currently utilized by the company  that are not mentioned above  are already year compliant 
in addition to the major computer systems described above  the company primarily utilizes standardized and upgraded microsoft office products that are year compliant 
all personal computer pc applications that are not in microsoft office are written in visual basic and programmed to handle year issues 
all operating systems utilized by the company  which include novell  intranetware  os  windows  and windows nt  are year compliant 
the company s as hardware and related network servers are year compliant as well 
the company has evaluated all data communications equipment  including pcs 
the company has located a minimal number of pcs requiring replacement and no significant deficiencies of data communications equipment have been found 
the company has identified non it systems that may be year sensitive  including primarily access gates  alarms  irrigation systems  thermostats  and utility meters and switches at its resorts 
although these systems vary by resort  most of these systems are already year compliant or are not reliant on a time chip that would be affected by year the company anticipates that all these systems will be year compliant by the end of the second quarter of the company has made inquiries of its major vendors  consisting primarily of financial institutions  regarding their year compliance status and its potential impact to the company s business 
based on these discussions  the company does not anticipate year difficulties associated with its major vendors 
the company  however  would change vendors if year problems at its existing vendors create interruptions to its business 
company management believes that the total cost of the aforementioned year computer system and equipment enhancements will be less than  including an estimate of internal payroll committed to the projects  of which approximately  has already been incurred 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to achieve year compliance 
the company estimates that its identification and assessment activities are approximately complete and that its remediation is approximately complete 
the failure to correct a material year internal problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of year readiness of third party vendors  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures of third party vendors will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
the company believes  however  that its year compliance plan and time line provide adequate staffing  resources  and time to mitigate and proactively respond to any unforeseen year problems in a timely and preemptive manner 
the cost of year compliance and the estimated date of completion of necessary modifications  however  are based on the company s best estimates  which were derived from various assumptions of future events 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
in the event of a complete failure of the company s information technology systems  the company would be able to continue the affected functions either manually or through the use of non year compliant systems 
the primary costs associated with such a necessity would be increased time delays associated with posting of information and increased personnel to manually process the information 
the company does not believe the increased costs associated with such personnel would be significant 
the company currently does not have a contingency plan in place 
the company will evaluate the need for a plan in as the company progresses through the year conversion 
subsequent events effective january   the company established the silverleaf resorts  inc k plan the plan  a qualified defined contribution retirement plan covering employees years of age or older who have completed one year of service 
the plan allows eligible employees to defer receipt of up to of their compensation and contribute such amounts to various investment funds 
the employee contributions vest immediately 
the company is not required by the plan to match employee contributions  however  may do so on a discretionary basis 
the company  however  will incur the administrative costs of maintaining the plan 
in january  the company acquired undeveloped land near the villages resort in tyler  texas  for approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of and for the year ended december   the company had no derivative financial instruments or foreign operations
