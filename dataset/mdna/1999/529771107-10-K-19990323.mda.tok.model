such failures could materially adversely affect the company s operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that meet customers needs 
the markets for printers and associated supplies are increasingly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the company and its major competitors  all of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their printers and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  the inkjet printer market has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant printer price pressure from the company s major competitors 
price reductions beyond expectations or the inability to reduce costs  contain expenses or increase sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to increase printer and associated supplies manufacturing capacity in line with growing market demands and to manage inventory levels to support the demands of new customers as well as its established customer base

the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  variations in the cost of component parts  delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and programs  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses

moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets as a result  in part  of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise adversely affect its operating results  cash flows  financial position or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in enforcing its intellectual property rights against others 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including economic and business conditions  both national and international  the potential impact of the year conversion on customers or suppliers  the loss of significant customers or suppliers  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings  changes in and execution of the company s business strategy  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results
