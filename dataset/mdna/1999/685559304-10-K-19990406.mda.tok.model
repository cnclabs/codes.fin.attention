accordingly  the company recorded an additional charge of  during interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the prior year  principally due to interest recorded in the current period by the company related to a debt obligation of the discontinued apparel operations 
such interest expense was recorded as part of the discontinued apparel operations for a portion of the prior period

excluding the impact of the income tax benefit  the settlement of the class action litigation and the resolution of the dispute  net income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  from the prior year 
this decrease was principally due to lower profits recorded by the company s power units segment resulting from a decrease in the segment s sales 
year ended december  v 
year ended december  in august  the company adopted a plan to sell its apparel segments 
the plan of disposal of such segments left the company with its electronics and power units segments 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the prior year due principally to additional sales recorded by orbit s power units segment which was acquired as a result of the behlman acquisition during the first quarter of sales for the electronic segment the orbit instrument division did not materially change from to gross profit  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended december  decreased to from for the prior year due to lower margins realized both from the electronics segment and the power units segment due to slightly higher production overhead costs and to the product mix of units sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased slightly to  from  for the prior year due principally to a full year of selling  general and administrative costs incurred by the company s power units segment  which was acquired in february offset by lower corporate costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  decreased slightly to from for the prior year due to lower corporate costs and increased sales from behlman which increased at a greater rate than costs for that segment 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the prior year due to interest recorded in the current year by the company related to a certain debt obligation of the discontinued apparel operations 
investment and other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the prior year 
such decrease is due principally to  of royalty income recorded in which represented a portion of a one time royalty fee received from a former affiliate and a reduction in available balances for investment in income from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the prior year due principally to the recording  in the first quarter of  of  which represented a portion of a one time royalty fee received from a former affiliate 
had this royalty income not been recorded in  income from continuing operations for the year ended december  would have decreased to  from  for the prior year 
this decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense and a decrease in investment and other income during the current year 
net income for the year ended december  increased to  from a loss of  for the year ended december  due principally to an operating loss in the prior period of  incurred from the company s discontinued apparel operations and to the estimated loss of  resulting from the expected loss on the disposal of such apparel operations 
liquidity  capital resources and inflation working capital increased to  at december  compared to  at december  the ratio of current assets to liabilities slightly increased to to at december  from to at december net cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the net income for the period  changes in the company s working capital and the non cash flow effect of a deferred tax asset 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the net purchases of marketable securities 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to repayments of long term debt plus the payoff of the company s asset based lending arrangement and treasury share purchases partially offset by the proceeds of a new credit facility 
all operations of the discontinued apparel companies have been terminated 
all losses  and obligations of these apparel operations have been provided for  and accordingly  the company does not anticipate using any significant portion of its resources towards these discontinued apparel operations 
in august  the company closed on a new  credit facility with a new lender secured by real property and other assets of the company 
the company used  of the proceeds to replace its existing asset based lending arrangement and the remaining  borrowed in was used to partially fund the class action securities litigation settlement of  which was paid in under the company s factoring arrangement for its discontinued canadian apparel operations  the company provided a standby letter of credit as security for its guaranty under this lending facility  collateralized by marketable securities 
as of december   the company had provided approximately  in a standby letter or credit 
such letter of credit expired in february and all obligations of the company relating to the guaranty were paid 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to  shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
through march   the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
the company s existing capital resources  including its bank credit facilities  and its cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to cover the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation has not materially impacted the operations of the company 
certain material trends tc l certain material trends despite continued profitability in  the company continues to face a very difficult business environment with continuing pressure on the company s prices for its sole source sales and a general reduction in the level of funding for the defense sector 
the company continues to pursue many business opportunities  including programs in which it has long participated but  due to industry wide funding and pricing pressures  the company has encountered delays in the awards of these contracts 
the delay in receiving these awards will shift a portion of shipments anticipated for into the year consequently  the company projects that the revenue of the company s electronics segment in will not match the current year s levels 
the company continues to seek new contracts which require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and preproduction costs 
while the company attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by its customers  including the united states government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the united states government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun which may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and preproduction stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
the company is heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
world events have led the united states government to reevaluate the level of military spending necessary for national security 
any significant reductions in the level of military spending by the united states government could have a negative impact on the company s future revenues and earnings 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s line of commercial products gives the company some diversity and the orbit instrument division is beginning to introduce certain of its products into commercial and foreign markets 
the company has retained oem capital corp 
aoem  an investment banking firm specializing in the electronics  communications and computer industries  to assist the company in identifying viable acquisition opportunities 
although the company is committed to enhancing its sales and profitability through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth  there is no guarantee that oem will present acquisition candidates that will ultimately result in transactions for the company 
year tc l year in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company notes that certain statements contained in the following discussion concerning the change over to the year are forward looking in nature and are subject to many risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include such matters as the company s projected state of readiness  the company s projected cost of remediation  the expected date of completion of remediation and the expected contingency plans associated with any worst case scenarios 
such statements also constitute ayear readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such software may recognize a date using a as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations 
the company has developed a plan to modify its information technology systems to recognize the year  including the purchase of a new manufacturing software package  and has begun converting its critical data processing systems 
the company expects the project to cost between  and  which will be funded by cash from operations 
this estimate includes the price of new software and internal costs but excludes the costs to upgrade and replace systems in the normal course of business as well as implementation of a new software package 
the company did not expend any significant amount of money on this project for the year ended december  and  although there can be no assurance  does not expect this project to have a material effect on its operations in the company also initiated discussions with its significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to ensure that these parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with company systems or otherwise impact its operations 
however the company is currently uncertain as to the impact on its operations  liquidity and financial condition should these organizations fail to properly remediate their computer systems 
while the company intends to use diligent efforts and care to implement the plan set forth above and to take any other necessary steps with regard to its information technology systems to prepare for the year  there is no assurance that such steps will effectively accomplish such goal 
furthermore  any failure on the part of the company s primary suppliers  service providers and customers to adapt their respective information technology systems to recognize the year could adversely impact the company 
furthermore  the united states government has been a significant customer of the company for many years 
there have recently been several press reports concerning whether certain departments of the united states government will be year compliant on a timely basis 
to the extent problems are identified  the company will implement corrective procedures where necessary to avoid any adverse effect on the company s cash flow and financial condition 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption or failure of certain important business operations 
the failure of the company s sales and billing systems could result in the company s inability to timely post and record sales revenue and expenses 
in addition  the aging of the company s accounts payable would be inaccurate 
the company has prepared contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increase of inventories  and protective cash management procedures 
the financial impact of any or all of the above worst case scenarios has not been and cannot be estimated by the company due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with such scenarios 
management believes  however  that its year program will significantly reduce the company s risks associated with the change over to the year forward looking statements tc l forward looking statements statements in this item amanagement s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this document as well as statements made in press releases and oral statements that may be made by the company or by officers  directors or employees of the company acting on the company s behalf that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute aforward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from the historical results or from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
most of the company s debt is at a variable rate of interest and is not hedged by any derivative instruments 
that debt which is subject to a variable rate of interest amounted to approximately  at december  if market interest rates increase by five percent from levels at december   the effect on the company s results of operations would be approximately
