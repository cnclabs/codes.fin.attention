item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of the financial position and results of operations of seagull for each of the periods indicated 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
consolidated highlights amounts in thousands year ended december  revenues oil and gas operations    alaska transmission and distribution    operating profit loss oil and gas operations    alaska transmission and distribution    corporate    net income loss    net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities    net cash provided by operating activities    during  the oil prices realized by seagull dropped  from s per barrel to per barrel 
these low oil prices in represent the lowest oil prices received in a number of years and were a major contributing factor to the million  or  decrease in oil revenues from to million for the year ended december  additionally  domestic natural gas prices decreased from per mcf in to per mcf for this gas price decrease and a decrease in domestic gas production combined to create a million decrease in domestic natural gas revenues 
these decreases in oil and gas prices in combination with other key factors led to significant decreases in revenues  operating profit  net income and net cash provided by operating activities as compared to the other key items affecting results include the following o seagull recorded noncash charges of million in the third quarter of related to the impairment of the company s oil and gas assets and nonstrategic pipeline assets  seagull energy corporation o oil and gas reserves decreased from mmboe to mmboe at december  and  respectively  o substantial increases in exploration charges for versus due to increases in dry hole expenses and leasehold impairments  o the sale of the company s canadian oil and gas operations in october  o one time compensation costs of approximately million associated with the retirement of barry j 
galt and the appointment of james t 
hackett as the company s chief executive officer  and o income tax benefit of of the loss before taxes for  reflecting primarily the tax benefits of the impairment of long lived assets and one time compensation matters  versus s tax expense of of earnings before taxes 
during  as a result of the addition of seagull s egyptian properties and an increase in domestic gas prices  seagull s net income improved by million to million in versus and cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities improved million to million for the increase in net income and cash flow was concentrated in the o g segment 
oil and gas operations amounts in thousands year ended december  revenues natural gas    oil and ngl    pipeline and marketing    production expenses    pipeline and marketing expenses    exploration charges    depreciation  depletion and amortization 
   impairment of long lived assets  operating profit loss    exploration and production revenue the decline in commodity prices was the significant factor in the decrease in revenues for the o g segment to million for the gas price decrease and a decrease in domestic gas production combined to create a million decrease in domestic natural gas revenues 
while the declining oil prices mentioned previously were the primary factor for the decrease in oil revenues  this was slightly offset by a increase in oil and ngl production in the us and egypt combined as seagull seagull energy corporation realized additional contributions from several new domestic wells and three egyptian concessions qarun  where additional facilities became operational during mid  east beni suef  where production began in mid  and west abu gharadig  which was purchased in late in  the o g segment showed a million increase in revenues to million and a million increase in operating profit to million 
this increase in o g revenues was principally due to stronger natural gas prices in nearly all areas of the company s production operations and increases in international oil and gas production  excluding canada which was sold in october the effect of stronger gas prices and international liquids production was partially offset by a decline in oil prices in all areas other than tatarstan  particularly egypt where the price decreased from to  and a decrease in pipeline and marketing revenues 
in october  the company sold its canadian oil and gas operations  which had revenues of approximately million and million and income loss before income taxes of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pipeline and marketing pipeline and marketing revenues declined million for the year ended as compared to due primarily to lower revenues related to the company s gas gathering and processing facilities caused by the lower natural gas prices in as compared to this decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in marketing revenues due to higher margins realized and by a decrease in the related cost of gas  resulting in a constant operating margin from to pipeline and marketing revenues declined from million in to million in with the absence of the higher margins created from the high volatility in the natural gas markets during early  partially offset by an increase in revenues related to the company s gas gathering and processing facilities 
this increase in gas gathering and processing revenues was substantially offset by an increase in the related cost of gas 
a decision to dispose of the pipeline assets was made in september at that time  the company also announced its intentions to exit its third party marketing business and to explore alternatives for marketing its equity production  including outsourcing 
subsequent to year end  seagull entered into an agreement with a third party to buy substantially all of the company s domestic production 
with the elimination of the pipeline and marketing function  seagull was able to reduce staff by approximately employees and effectively closed all derivative financial positions prior to december  income and costs related to the company s commodity hedging activities were recognized in oil and gas revenues when the commodities were produced 
the company recorded million  million  and million for  and  respectively  in costs seagull energy corporation related to equity hedging activities  including costs related to the monetary production payment hedges of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company also recorded hedging costs related to third party marketing activities of million in costs  million in costs and million in income for  and  respectively

production expenses production expenses for decreased million from s million  primarily due to the sale of the company s canadian operations in october  partially offset by increases in production expenses in egypt 
production expenses increased to per boe for from per boe for production expenses for increased approximately million over  primarily due to the increased production associated with the company s egyptian operations and increased domestic operating expenses 
this increase in production expenses associated with the company s domestic operations was the primary reason for the per boe increase in production expense per equivalent unit of production to per boe for over increased production taxes as natural gas prices increased  a change in the mix of producing properties and an increase in transportation expenses were the major contributing factors to the increase in domestic operating expenses during exploration charges in comparison to  exploration charges for were approximately million higher for the year primarily due to increases in dry hole expense and seagull energy corporation impairment of leaseholds  both domestically and on certain of the company s egyptian concessions 
exploration charges declined million for the year ended as compared to due to decreases in dry hole costs  domestically and in canada  and in g g expense  primarily in cote d ivoire 
depreciation  depletion and amortization the decrease in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense to million for from million for the prior year is primarily due to the decrease in domestic gas production and the sale of the company s canadian operations  partially offset by increased oil production in egypt and an increase in the dd a expense per equivalent unit of production related to the company s egyptian operations 
the downward revision of reserves in the egyptian concessions previously discussed and the sale of canadian properties  which had an average dd a expense of less than per boe  combined to increase dd a expense per equivalent unit of production for oil and gas producing activities to per boe from per boe for and  respectively 
dd a expense per equivalent unit of production increased to per boe in from per boe in and combined with the increase in egyptian production to produce a increase in dd a expense for the o g segment 
a change in the mix of the properties being produced internationally was the primary factor for the increase  partially offset by a decrease in dd a expense related to canadian oil and gas properties 
noncash impairments during the third quarter of  the company recorded noncash impairment charges of million related to its oil and gas assets located in egypt 
the impairments of the oil and gas assets were primarily a result of disappointing well performance  much lower oil and natural gas prices and a lack of any perceived significant near term improvement in oil prices that led to a reduction in reserves at seagull s east zeit  south hurghada and east beni suef concessions 
the oil and gas impairment tests were based upon estimates of future cash flows using an initial crude oil price of approximately per barrel  escalated by quoted forward market prices when available and moderate escalation thereafter 
there are no future cash flows from gas  as there is no gas production from these assets 
future cash flows at september  were based upon the company s estimate of proved reserves 
no probable and possible reserves were taken into consideration in this particular circumstance because they were not justified by economic conditions  actual or planned drilling 
during this quarter  the company also decided to dispose of nonstrategic pipeline assets  which resulted in an additional noncash impairment of million related to those assets 
the impairment reflected the difference between the recorded book value of the pipeline assets and the net realizable value expected to be received upon disposal of the assets 
seagull energy corporation capital spending and oil and gas reserves oil and gas operations capital expenditures and acquisitions amounts in thousands year ended december  capital expenditures lease acquisitions    exploration    development    other oil and gas operations total oil and gas operations    acquisitions of oil and gas properties    capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  remained unchanged from the absence of the company s canadian operations  which had expenditures of million in  and a decline in egyptian capital expenditures were offset by increased expenditures related to the company s domestic operations 
spending outside north america in totaled million  of which million was for exploration  million for exploitation and million for leasehold acquisitions 
seagull participated in the drilling of exploratory wells during  of which were successful 
another exploratory wells were in progress at year end 
of the successes  seven were in the us  four in egypt and one in cote d ivoire 
o g capital expenditures increased to million in  up from million in spending outside north america totaled million  of which million was for exploration and million for exploitation 
on june   the company completed the purchase of the stock of brg petroleum  inc and its related partnership interests for million in cash  net of cash acquired of million and noncash deferred tax liabilities of million 
the assets acquired include proved oil and gas reserves of bcfe 
brg operated approximately percent of its oil and gas wells located in approximately fields 
at year end  daily production from these acquired properties averaged approximately mmcf of gas and barrels of oil and natural gas liquids 
the most significant of these assets are concentrated in east texas  primarily in freestone  upshur  rusk and nacogdoches counties 
during the fourth quarter of  seagull sold some of its less strategic e p properties and various nonstrategic pipeline assets 
the sale of these assets  and the additional pipeline asset sales expected to occur in early  were steps taken to reduce debt and focus the company s attention on assets within core areas 
prior to the sales  daily production from the e p properties sold averaged approximately mmcf of gas and barrels of oil and natural gas liquids 
the total reserves sold associated with these seagull energy corporation properties was approximately mmboe 
the pipeline assets contributed million  million and million in revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  but did not have a material effect on operating profit for any of these periods 
through drilling and proved property acquisitions  the company replaced of its production during  including downward revisions of mmboe  at a cost of per boe and of its production over the five year period ended december  at a cost of per boe 
seagull s proved oil and gas reserves decreased from mmboe at year end to mmboe at december   because of reserve declines due to lower commodity prices  disappointing well performance in certain egyptian concessions and the nonstrategic property sales  partially offset by the mmboe purchased from brg petroleum 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows before taxes for seagull s proved oil and gas reserves  calculated based on securities and exchange commission criteria  decreased to million at december  compared with billion at the end of this decrease was primarily the result of significantly lower year end commodity prices at december  compared to december  year end calculations were made using an average price of and per bbl for oil  condensate and ngl and and per mcf for gas for and  respectively 
the company s average realized prices for the year ended december  were per bbl for oil  condensate and ngl and per mcf for gas 
the company s average realized prices for the month ended january  were per bbl for oil  condensate and ngl and per mcf for gas 
because the disclosure requirements for discounted future net cash flows are standardized by the sec  significant changes can occur in these estimates based upon oil and gas prices in effect at year end 
the above estimates should not be viewed as an estimate of fair market value 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
outlook as the o g segment represents the majority of the company s operations  continued depressed commodity prices will have a significant negative impact on the company s total operating results 
oil prices in particular have reached multi year lows in some markets in recent months and gas prices for the current winter season have been lower than in recent winters 
faced with continued depressed oil prices  if the oei merger is completed  seagull and new ocean plan to spend significantly less on capital expenditures in capital expenditures will focus on contractually obligated expenditures and drilling results that will yield immediate cash flow opportunities 
with this decrease in capital expenditures  the company may not be able to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
seagull energy corporation alaska transmission and distribution amounts in thousands except degree days year ended december  revenues    cost of gas sold    gross margin    operations and maintenance expense    depreciation  depletion and amortization    operating profit    operating data degree days    a measure of weather severity calculated by subtracting the mean temperature for each day from degrees fahrenheit 
more degree days equate to colder weather 
operating profit of the alaska transmission and distribution segment of the company is primarily a function of the weather in the anchorage  alaska area during the winter heating season 
cold weather equates to higher gas volumes delivered  resulting in increased profits 
this relationship between operating profit and degree days held true in and as the percentage change in operating profit increase in versus and decrease in versus was approximately equal to the percentage change in degree days increase in and decrease in 
outlook even though its activities may be somewhat different from the company s other o g oriented activities  management expects enstar alaska s stable cash flows and activities to continue to contribute to seagull s goals and financial stability 
future operating profit for this segment will be affected by weather  regulatory action and customer growth in enstar alaska s service area 
the degree days were under the previous year average degree days 
the company expects customer growth to continue at a modest to rate 
during the summer construction season  approximately miles of new distribution pipelines were installed to connect some  new customers a increase in customers over 
enstar alaska purchases all of its natural gas under long term contracts in which the price is indexed to changes in the price of crude oil futures contracts 
however  because enstar alaska s sales prices are adjusted to include the projected cost of its natural gas  there has been and is expected to be little or no impact on margins derived from enstar alaska s gas sales as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices due to worldwide political events and changing market conditions 
seagull energy corporation currently  enstar alaska s supply source is confined to the cook inlet area 
during  two of the cook inlet area s major suppliers filed for regulatory approval to export certain quantities of gas to overseas liquified natural gas markets 
enstar alaska has filed as an intervenor in these proceedings and is actively working with regulatory authorities to ensure that the future gas supply needs of its customers are met 
other general and administrative g a expense increased from million to million for primarily due to the million in one time compensation charges  partially offset by decreases in g a expense from compensation plans that are tied directly to the market price of seagull s common stock 
the closing price of seagull s common stock was and at december  and  respectively 
after excluding the effects of provisions for litigation million in for a proposed settlement and million in covering several minor settlements  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease in g a expenses from to was primarily due to efficiencies realized as a result of the global merger and a decline in expenses associated with compensation plans that are tied directly to the market price of seagull s common stock 
in november  the company  noram gas transmission company and arkansas western gas company signed a settlement proposal regarding certain litigation 
the final settlement was signed in and was substantially the same as the initial settlement proposal 
the payments to noram and other parties settled complex litigation over contract terms  conditions and conduct for the period october  to the date of the settlement 
interest expense increased only slightly from million for to million for despite the increase in outstanding long term debt from million at december  to million at december   average debt outstanding  and therefore interest expense  was approximately the same for each of the years 
interest expense declined from million in to million for through utilization of the proceeds from the sale of the company s canadian operations in late to repay amounts outstanding under the company s existing credit facilities 
interest cost capitalized as property  plant and equipment amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company and global natural resources  inc completed a merger in october  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result of the merger  expenses of million million after taxes representing investment banking fees  legal  accounting and other expenses were recorded 
seagull energy corporation gain on sales of assets in is primarily comprised of pre tax gains of approximately million related to the sale of the company s canadian oil and gas operations 
seagull s tax expense changed from approximately of earnings before taxes for the year ended december  to an approximate benefit for  reflecting primarily the tax benefits of the impairment of long lived assets and one time compensation matters 
seagull s effective tax rate for of decreased from the effective tax rate of for primarily due to an income tax benefit associated with the gain on the sale of the company s canadian operations 
outlook in the current low commodity price environment  seagull has begun implementing cost cutting measures  such as the elimination of the pipeline and marketing function and an additional reduction of approximately employees  approximately of total employees  in january these personnel reductions are expected to generate an annual savings of approximately million  excluding severance costs of million 
in addition  seagull and oei are developing plans to integrate their operations immediately after the merger to take full advantage of the benefits and synergies the merger will create 
seagull and oei believe that new ocean s organizational structure will allow for substantial overhead cost savings through the consolidation of duplicative corporate and field offices and staff 
liquidity and capital resources seagull s capital resources primarily consist of a revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a maximum commitment of million  million of senior  unsecured debt and money market facilities with three us banks with a combined maximum commitment of million 
the major changes in these obligations are as follows o the repurchase of million of senior debt in the third quarter of  financed through additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility  o the purchase of the brg properties for million in the second quarter of  financed through additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility  and o the issuance of million of senior notes  due  in september at december   there was million borrowed under the revolving credit facility and million of the unused commitment was immediately available 
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants and restrictive provisions  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or liens  the declaration or payment of dividends and the repurchase seagull energy corporation or redemption of capital stock and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  approximately million was available for payment of cash dividends on common stock or to repurchase common stock as of december  during the third quarter of  the company repurchased in open market transactions approximately million in aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due these purchases were funded using borrowings under the credit facility 
in connection with this repurchase  the company recorded an after tax extraordinary loss of million  or per basic and diluted share 
at current interest rates under the revolving credit facility  the company expects to save approximately million in annual interest expense by refinancing the million of senior subordinated notes under the revolving credit facility 
on june   the company completed the purchase of the stock of brg petroleum  inc and its related partnership interests for million in cash  excluding cash acquired of million and noncash deferred tax liabilities of million 
the company funded this acquisition through its existing credit facility 
on september   seagull issued million of senior notes the senior notes at a public offering price of of face value 
the senior notes have a coupon of and mature september  the senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes represent unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all other unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of the company 
the company has money market facilities with three us banks with a combined maximum commitment of million 
these lines of credit bear interest at rates made available by the banks at their option and may be canceled at either seagull s or the banks option 
there was million outstanding under these money market facilities at december   included in accounts and notes payable 
capital expenditures and acquisitions amounts in thousands year ended december  capital expenditures oil and gas operations    alaska transmission and distribution    corporate    acquisitions    seagull energy corporation combined with the company s long term goal to grow its reserve base through its drilling efforts and complementary strategic acquisitions  a strong balance sheet is also a specific objective of management 
in its present low commodity price environment  seagull began a series of nonstrategic properties sales in late in  seagull also reduced its borrowings under existing bank facilities by million with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the company s canadian operations 
during the fourth quarter of  seagull sold some of its less strategic e p properties located away from its various core assets 
during the third quarter of  the company also decided to liquidate its nonstrategic pipeline assets 
as of december   approximately of these pipeline assets had been sold 
the e p and pipeline sales generated approximately million in net proceeds 
seagull is in final negotiations to sell the remaining of the pipeline assets 
outlook after the merger with oei  new ocean will have higher levels of debt and interest expense than seagull on a stand alone basis 
this increased debt level will require the use of a substantial portion of new ocean s cash flow to pay interest and principal on new ocean s debt 
within the low commodity price environment  new ocean anticipates substantially reduced capital expenditures and expects to keep capital expenditures at a level below cash flow from operations 
new ocean will have higher levels of debt and interest expense than seagull on a stand alone basis 
the following table compares debt and leverage for seagull and new ocean  based on december  information  giving pro forma effect to the merger in the case of new ocean seagull new ocean total debt million  million debt capitalization ratio the increase in total indebtedness and leverage of the combined company after the merger may have a negative impact on new ocean s ability to realize the expected benefits of the merger  including a possible downgrade in the credit rating of the combined company 
in this regard  standard poor s has announced that  because of the higher leverage of the combined company and the current uncertain commodity price environment  upon completion of the merger  it will reduce seagull s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings from bbb to bb  with a stable outlook

the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document could affect the future results of the energy industry in general  and seagull and or new ocean after the merger in particular  and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements o risks incident to the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells  o future production and development costs  o the effect of existing and future laws and regulatory actions  o the political and economic climate in the foreign jurisdictions in which seagull conducts oil and gas operations  o the effect of changes in commodity prices  hedging activities and conditions in the capital markets  o a significant delay in the expected closing of the merger or a failure to consummate the merger  and o competition from others in the energy industry 
environmental to date  compliance with applicable environmental and safety regulations by the company has not required any significant capital expenditures or materially affected its business or earnings 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with environmental and safety regulations and foresees no material expenditures in the future  however  the company is unable seagull energy corporation to predict the impact that compliance with future regulations may have on capital expenditures  earnings and competitive position 
year historically  most computer systems including microprocessors embedded into field equipment and other machinery utilized software that recognized a calendar year by its last two digits 
beginning in the year  these systems will require modification to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates year issues 
accordingly  the company has initiated a comprehensive plan to address the year issues associated with its operations and business the year plan 
seagull s board of directors has been briefed about the year problem generally and as it may affect seagull 
the board has created a committee consisting of senior executives and a representative from the board to oversee the adoption and implementation of the year plan covering all of seagull s business units 
the plan has been developed with an aim towards taking reasonable steps to prevent seagull s mission critical functions from being impaired due to the year problem 
the plan includes several phases i assessment of all of the company s systems and technology  ii implementation and testing of modifications to or replacements of existing systems and technology  both financial and operational  iii communication with key business partners regarding year issues  and iv contingency planning 
in planning and developing the project  seagull has considered both its information technology it and its non it systems 
the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as it systems  including accounting  data processing  telephone systems  scanning equipment  and other miscellaneous systems 
non it systems include alarm systems  fax machines  monitors for field operations  and other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain embedded technology  which complicates seagull s year identification  assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  seagull is in the process of replacing the computer equipment and software it currently uses to become year compliant 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  seagull plans to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
during  the company utilized both internal and external resources to test  reprogram or replace many of its it systems  primarily financial and operational software  for necessary modifications identified in its assessment of year issues 
as of the date of this filing  the company estimates that approximately of its year plan related to these it systems has been implemented and anticipates that the remainder of the plan  including any necessary remedial action  will be completed by june  during september  the company seagull energy corporation began utilizing internal and external resources to evaluate its vulnerability to year issues related to its non it systems  primarily field operational systems and equipment 
the company is working with stone webster to identify embedded chips that may need to be replaced or avoided 
stone webster is an internationally recognized engineering firm that has developed and maintains a database of systems that are susceptible to year problems 
the database comparisons that have been completed to date have not revealed any material problems 
this effort should be completed by the end of the first quarter of areas that will require contingency plans will be determined as part of these efforts relative to embedded chips and microcontrollers and as a result of our correspondence and meetings with key business partners 
this effort should be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company has also initiated formal communications with all of its key business partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties potential failure to remediate their own year issues 
key business partners were identified in four categories of companies including a major vendors and contractors including banks and other financial service companies  b major customers  c utility companies  and d third party operators of major oil and gas properties 
questionnaires were sent to the company s key business partners to confirm their year activities and follow up letters  telephone calls  and meetings are being used  as appropriate  to obtain additional information 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began developing contingency plans for its financial and operational systems 
seagull s contingency plans are being designed to minimize the disruptions or other adverse effects resulting from year incompatibilities regarding these systems  and to facilitate the early identification and remediation of year problems that first manifest themselves after january  the failure to correct a material year issue could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities  resulting in a material  adverse affect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
the company s remediation efforts are expected to reduce significantly the company s level of uncertainty about year compliance and the possibility of interruptions of normal operations 
however  there can be no guarantee that other companies systems  on which the company s systems rely  will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
disruptions to the oil and gas transportation networks controlled by third party carriers could result in reduced production volumes delivered to market 
in addition  risks associated with foreign operations may increase with the uncertainty of year compliance by foreign governments and their supporting infrastructures 
the company s year task force members have been asked to investigate the compliance activities of certain third parties and foreign governments to determine the risks to the company 
this investigation is in progress 
seagull energy corporation in a recent securities and exchange commission release regarding year disclosures  the securities and exchange commission stated that public companies must disclose the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
analysis of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios seagull may face leads to contemplation of the following possibilities which  though unlikely in some or many cases  must be included in any consideration of worst cases widespread failure of electrical  gas  and similar supplies by utilities serving seagull domestically and internationally  widespread disruption of the services of communications common carriers domestically and internationally  similar disruption to means and modes of transportation for seagull and its employees  contractors  suppliers  and customers  significant disruption to seagull s ability to gain access to  and remain working in  office buildings and other facilities  the failure of substantial numbers of seagull s mission critical information computer hardware and software systems  including both internal business systems and systems such as those with embedded chips controlling operational facilities such as onshore and offshore oil and gas rigs  oil and gas pipelines and gas plants domestically and internationally  the effects of which would have a cumulative material adverse impact on seagull 
among other things  seagull could face substantial claims by customers or loss of revenues due to service interruptions  inability to fulfill contractual obligations  inability to account for certain revenues or obligations or to bill customers accurately and on a timely basis  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following mission critical failures  and the execution of contingency plans 
seagull could also experience an inability by customers  traders  and others to pay  on a timely basis or at all  obligations owed to seagull 
under these circumstances  the adverse effect on seagull  and the diminution of seagull s revenues  would be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
further in this scenario  the cumulative effect of these failures could have a substantial adverse effect on the economy  domestically and internationally 
the adverse effect on seagull  and the diminution of seagull s revenues  from a domestic or global recession or depression is also likely to be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
the total costs for the year compliance review  evaluation  assessment and remediation efforts are not expected to be in excess of million 
of this amount  approximately million had been incurred as of december  accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes standards of accounting for and disclosures of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet determined the impact of this statement on the company s financial condition or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk seagull is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  and ngls 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
the company made a limited use of a variety of derivative financial instruments only for non trading purposes as a seagull energy corporation hedging strategy to manage commodity prices associated with oil and gas sales and to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
the company used the hedge or deferral method of accounting for these instruments and  as a result  gains and losses on commodity derivative financial instruments were generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
as discussed earlier  seagull effectively closed all derivative financial positions prior to december  interest rate risk from time to time  the company has entered into various financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements  to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
currently  seagull has no open interest rate swap or interest rate lock agreements 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations at december  thereafter total fair value notes payable variable rate    average interest rate long term debt  including current maturities variable rate    average interest rate fixed rate         average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several foreign currencies and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
however  because predominantly all transactions in seagull s existing foreign operations  other than tatarstan  are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all those operations 
exposure from market rate fluctuations related to activities in tatarstan is not material
