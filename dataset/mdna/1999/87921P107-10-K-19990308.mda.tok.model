item description of business telcom semiconductor  inc the company or telcom designs  develops  manufactures and markets a diversified portfolio of high performance analog integrated circuits for a wide variety of applications in the industrial  wireless communications  computing  networking and medical markets 
the company s products comprise four principal product families power management products such as mosfet drivers  low drop out regulators  dc to dc converters  and cmos voltage detectors including microprocessor supervisory circuits  data converter products which include data acquisition system and display analog to digital converters  thermal management products that provide thermal control information  and linear products such as operational amplifiers  voltage references and comparators that act as linear building blocks in a wide range of electronic systems 
within each family  the company markets proprietary and selected second source products offering a range of performance  functionality  and price 
the company was organized in delaware in june and began operations in december after purchasing the semiconductor operations of teledyne  inc teledyne which principally consisted of its teledyne components division teledyne components 
the company s principal executive offices are located at terra bella avenue  mountain view  california  and its telephone number is customers and markets telcom s basic marketing strategy is to identify and work with leading customers within each of its targeted market segments to jointly develop product solutions that offer a combination of high performance and increased functionality 
an additional benefit of working with leading customers is the ability to gain insight into their next generation product requirements and to identify second source product needs that the company may be in a position to fulfill 
telcom believes that its relationships with market leaders  such as motorola and qualcomm in the cellular telephone market and compaq computer and intel in the pc market  enable the company to sell such product solutions to other significant participants in such markets 
telcom also relies on its worldwide distribution network to accumulate information about other possible applications for the company s products 
the company uses strategic partners to augment its product portfolio and core competencies  and to achieve new channels to market 
in addition these strategic relationships are expected to allow the company to more rapidly identify and respond to market opportunities 
the company s products are used in a broad range of applications within the industrial  wireless communications  networking  and computing markets 
these categories are discussed below wireless and networking market the proliferation of hand held communications devices such as cellular telephones  pocket pagers and personal two way radios has created a demand for analog devices that monitor and reduce power consumption 
telcom offers a range of analog circuits to address the demands of these products for longer battery life 
these circuits include battery full low charge detection and dc dc converters for the generation of voltages to drive liquid crystal displays  including backlighting 
these devices are offered in miniature packages resulting in savings in space and weight 
the company s family of high current mosfet drivers are used with telcom s switch mode power supply controllers to regulate ac to dc power in cellular base stations  pbx and telephone and data communication equipment 
computer market the rapid adoption of networked pcs  workstations and servers and the deployment of machines using high performance microprocessors have given rise to the need for reliable temperature rise detection for power supply shutdown and fan speed control 
as part of its smart sensor product family  telcom has a patented solid state temperature sensor that facilitates rapid temperature rise detection that can be used for controlled shutdown of equipment with no loss of data or destruction of critical or expensive components 
this trend to protect critical components by replacing older mechanical solutions with high performance analog devices is extending into notebook computers  modular power supplies and industrial and consumer product temperature alarms 
the reliability and robust nature of silicon make analog devices preferable to mechanical devices in many respects 
telcom also makes power analog circuits for use in laptop notebook computers  palmtop computers  personal digital assistants  disk drives  pocket organizers  facsimile modems and cd rom products 
these products offer low operating current and or high current drive capability for deriving additional voltages from battery or line powered equipment 
industrial market increased demand for precision and reliability has resulted in higher semiconductor content in industrial instruments and manufacturing equipment 
telcom offers a broad range of integrating analog to digital converters that address the measurement of dc and ac voltages and currents  resistance and capacitance 
these devices are commonly used in digital multimeters  panel meters  temperature meters  digital scales and digital oscilloscopes 
this broad line of power management circuits offers the ability to detect and regulate voltages for use in battery and line powered industrial equipment 
products the company s basic product strategy is to address an increasing spectrum of customer applications by introducing proprietary and selected second source products that increase the range of performance and capabilities of its product portfolios 
to accomplish this the company focuses on providing customer value via both higher analog performance as well as integration 
integration is the process of adding more functionality on a single piece of silicon and adding value to the customer from the improved reliability and lower cost associated with reduced component count 
the company s internal development activities focus on technology  high quality  and fast time to market 
maintaining a proper mix of platform and derivative products is also important 
a platform product is the first product aimed at a market segment while a derivative product takes a platform product and adds new functionality or packaging to create a follow on product 
the company offers a diversified portfolio of over analog and mixed signal integrated circuit products for a wide range of market applications 
the company s long term goal is to have a broad range of customers and products such that dependencies on any one product  customer  or industry is small 
through the company has not been successful in achieving this goal as motorola and the wireless market segment remain a significant portion of the company s revenue 
power management products the power management circuits offered by the company are power mosfet drivers  low drop out regulators  dc dc converters  and cmos voltage detectors including microprocessor supervisory circuits 
the company s cmos ldo low drop out regulators offer dropout voltages minimum voltage needed across the device to maintain output voltage regulation of milli volts and efficient current consumption to maximize the time before the battery is exhausted data converter products telcom s data converter products include data acquisition system and display analog to digital a d converters 
the company is expanding its position as a supplier of a d converters by introducing devices with higher accuracy resolution and increased functionality 
the company is also developing relationships with customers in the field of portable measuring instrumentation used in temperature monitoring  automotive diagnostics and field test equipment process control and data acquisition systems also benefit from the inherent capability of dual slope and sigma delta a d converters to reject line interference 
thermal management products the increasing trend towards lightweight  high performance pcs and other products has necessitated smaller enclosures and faster microprocessors  resulting in a significant increase in the amount of heat generated within such products 
telcom s range of solid state thermal management devices is aimed at monitoring and warning of fault conditions and solving thermal management problems 
for example  the company s proprietary tc temperature sensor protects advanced microprocessor based systems by monitoring the temperature of the microprocessor and automatically turning off the system when the system temperature exceeds a specified threshold 
other devices have various analog or digital output signals that provide thermal control information for both consumer electronics and industrial system applications 
linear products telcom produces operational amplifiers  voltage references  and comparators that act as linear building blocks in a wide range of electronic systems 
the company has developed a new family of precision cmos devices whose supply voltage rail to rail operation  low microamp level current drain  and small packages make them well suited for portable  battery operated equipment 
the company s chopper stabilized amplifiers are used in precision amplification of very low level signals in the microvolt millionth of a volt range often encountered with strain gauges 
these amplifiers have extremely low drift over both temperature and time 
the company s success depends upon its ability to develop new analog circuits for existing and new markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner and to have such products gain market acceptance 
the development of new analog circuits is highly complex and from time to time the company has experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion of design and testing of new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields and market acceptance of the company s and its customers products 
moreover  successful product design and development is dependent on the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified analog design engineers  of which there is a limited number 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
due to the complexity and variety of analog circuits  the limited number of analog circuit designers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of analog circuits  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
although the company seeks to design products that have the potential to become industry standard products  there can be no assurance that any products introduced by the company will be adopted by such market leaders  or that any products initially accepted by the company s customers that are market leaders will become industry standard products 
the company s failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could materially and adversely affect its business and operating results 
the company s results of operations are dependent on the balance between sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume proprietary products and relatively higher volume but lower margin second source products 
in order to improve its margins  sales of proprietary products must in the future represent a greater percentage of the company s net revenues  requiring the company to successfully develop  introduce and market new proprietary products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in its key markets will demand 
design and process technology design technology 
the design of analog circuits involves the design and interconnection of a variety of circuits and features to achieve the desired function 
the specific placement and interrelationship of these circuits is both complex and critical to the performance of the analog circuit 
computer aided design and engineering tools  which have proliferated and enhanced the design effort for digital integrated circuits  have proven to be useful but less effective for analog devices 
consequently  analog circuit design has traditionally been highly dependent on the skills and expertise of individual design engineers 
the company s design engineers principally focus on developing next generation standard products  using computer simulation models to design products that both meet the high performance characteristics required by customers and adjust for process and temperature variations 
telcom s new product development strategy emphasizes a broad line of standard products that are based on customer input and needs 
the company is currently developing products to further expand the number of offerings within each of the power management  data converter  thermal management  and linear product families 
process technology 
telcom utilizes cmos  bipolar and bicmos process technologies 
the process technology used for a particular product is driven by the product specifications and customer requirements 
cmos technology is the technology best suited for low power battery operated applications  has the advantages of low power consumption and high packing density  and enables the combination of analog and digital circuits on the same chip 
a substantial majority of the company s current products utilize some version of cmos 
bipolar technology is best suited for high gain  high speed  high precision and high voltage product applications 
the company competes in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  the company must develop or obtain access to new semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity  and improve manufacturing yields 
in order to have access to new semiconductor process technologies  particularly for products requiring sub micron processing  the company has entered into relationship with outside foundries to provide the processes and wafers the company needs to produce its products 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
the company s future operating results could be adversely impacted if the company fails to develop or obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies  or if it fails to define  design and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis 
also  the company s ability to compete successfully depends on being able to use advanced analog process technologies to manufacture its products 
there can be no assurance that the analog process technology utilized by the company will not become obsolete 
sales  distribution and marketing the company s sales and marketing effort is focused on the development of relationships with leading companies in its targeted markets  and its sales and marketing resources are deployed to establish and enhance such relationships 
telcom currently employs sales managers and application engineers in sales  marketing and applications organizations in the united states  europe  and asia 
the company s products are sold to over  end user customers throughout the world  either directly or through its distributor network 
sales to customers in north america  asia and europe accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales for  and  and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the company s three largest oem customers  motorola  intel  and compaq computer  accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales for  and   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the company anticipates that it will continue to be dependent on a number of key customers and distributors for a significant portion of its net sales 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers for any reason could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company sells its products through a direct sales staff and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors 
the direct sales staff works with leading customers to determine customer requirements and interfaces with design engineers to achieve client solutions and also manages the company s network of sales representatives and distributors 
the company sells its products in europe through an independent sales representative firm and various independent stocking representative distributor firms 
sales in asia are handled through various independent stocking representative distributor firms 
the stocking representatives distributor firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or act as the company s agent in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s sales organization provides direction and support to the independent sales representative firms  the distributor firms and the overseas independent stocking representatives distributor firms 
the company currently utilizes independent sales representative firms at various locations in the united states and canada 
the company also sells its products through national distributor firms 
sales through future electronics  the company s principal national distributor  accounted for and of the company s net sales for and  respectively 
consistent with standard industry practice  the national and regional distributor firms are entitled to certain price rebates and are allowed to return to the company a portion of the products purchased by them 
the company s distributors sell competitors products and are not within the control of the company 
loss of one or more of the company s current distributors or disruption in the company s sales and distribution channels could materially and adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company has contracts with all of its international distributors  the material terms of which typically include the following a the distributor is appointed as a non exclusive authorized distributor for a designated territory  b the distributor may return up to of its net sales in the prior month period as a credit against a new order of equal or greater amount of product  c the distributor is obligated to meet certain information reporting requirements  d the term of the contract is one year and is automatically renewable for one year periods and e the contract may be terminated at any time by either party upon days written notice 
the company also has contracts with its national distributors  including future electronics  which are substantially similar to the international distributor agreements 
international sales accounted for approximately of the company s net sales for and the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of product sales 
international sales and operations involve various risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
the company is also subject to general political risks in connection with its international operations  such as political and economic instability 
in addition  because a substantial majority of the company s international sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products  the sales of which are denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that regulatory  political and other factors will not adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
the company attempts to stock products in quantities that are sufficient to meet customer demand 
due to the product manufacturing cycle characteristic of semiconductor manufacturing and the inherent imprecision in forecasting customer demand  product inventories may not always correspond to product demand  leading to shortages or surpluses of certain products 
the company warrants that its products are free from defects in workmanship and materials for one year and that they meet the published specifications 
warranty expenses to date have been nominal 
manufacturing until february  telcom produced the majority of its wafers at its manufacturing facility in mountain view  california 
during the to time frame the company believed that its in house wafer fabrication facility provided a competitive advantage because it facilitated a close collaboration between design and process engineers  provided control over wafer supply  and offered the potential for lower manufacturing costs and accelerated new product introduction 
by early  market conditions had changed significantly resulting in outside foundries willing to run non standard processes and with market prices below the company s internal cost to manufacture 
as a result  in august  the company announced its plans to shut down its five inch wafer fabrication facility and use third party foundries for all of its wafer fabrication 
the fabrication of wafers is in the process of being transferred to third party foundries and it is anticipated that the transfer will be complete prior to the end of the first quarter of in connection with the closure of its wafer fabrication facility  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million in restructuring costs for the mountain view  california fabrication facility were million  while other one time charges totaled 
million 
the restructuring charge includes a write down of fabrication equipment of million  costs associated with idle facility space of million  employee severance costs of 
million and clean up and environmental related charges of 
million 
the other one time charges included the write down of 
million of certain test equipment in hong kong   the write down of certain equipment in mountain view totaling 
million  and 
million related to certain licensing and royalty costs  offset by a decrease of 
million in amounts previously accrued due to a change in the company s employee sabbatical policy 
approximately  square feet of the mountain view facility has been idled by this move to outside foundries 
the company utilizes cmos  silicon gate  bipolar and bicmos process technologies  which are tailored to meet product specifications and customer requirements 
outside wafers are purchased from one of five foundries and market conditions could result in wafers being in short supply and prevent the company from having adequate supply to meet its customer requirements 
there can be no assurances going forward that the company will have the ability to acquire all the wafers it desires 
the wafers are sent to the company s wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong which tests the individual die in wafer form  and distributes them to contract assembly houses  primarily in malaysia and thailand  to be packaged 
upon completion of the packaging operation  the units are returned to telcom hong kong for final testing in assembled form and are then shipped to customers worldwide 
the hong kong facility  which is leased by the company  is approximately  square feet and is presently testing approximately eight million units per month 
the packaging of the company s products is performed by a limited group of subcontractors and certain of the raw materials included in such products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
although the company seeks to reduce its dependence on its sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of any of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in the event that any of the company s subcontractors were to experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to the company  the company s operating results would be adversely affected until alternate subcontractors  if any  became available 
telcom designs and manufactures its own test equipment which can test both the individual die in wafer form and the finished assembled unit 
the company believes the cost of its in house tester is substantially less than the cost of purchasing an equivalent tester from an outside vendor 
in addition to the cost advantages  the company can also standardize its operations on one tester type and can therefore upgrade tester capability more easily than if it had purchased different testers from more than one vendor 
the company believes it is better able to meet its internal demand for test capacity by building its own testers because it is not subject to long lead times from outside vendors in times of rising demand for such equipment 
the company could purchase testers from outside vendors if it experienced problems in producing its own testers  but such equipment would be more costly 
a large portion of the company s costs of manufacturing are relatively fixed  and  consequently  the company s results of operation are volume sensitive 
a reduction in manufacturing yields or delays to product shipments would impact its operational results unfavorably 
the company has from time to time in the past experienced lower than expected production yields  which have delayed product shipments and adversely affected gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
research and development the ability of the company to compete successfully will depend substantially on its ability to define  design  develop and introduce on a timely basis new products offering design or technology innovations 
research and development in the analog integrated circuit industry is characterized primarily by circuit design and product engineering that enables new functionality or improved performance 
the company s research and development efforts are also directed at improving process technologies  reducing the cost of existing manufacturing processes  developing new process capabilities to manufacture new products and adding new features to existing products 
with respect to more established products  the company s research and development efforts also include product redesign  shrinkage of device size and reduction of mask steps in order to improve yields per wafer and reduce per device costs 
as of december   the company had employees engaged in research and development 
the company s research and development efforts are dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified analog design engineers 
the company also utilizes independent contractors for certain research and development projects 
in  and  the company spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development 
the company expects that it will continue to invest substantial funds in research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully and develop and bring to market such new products or that the company will be able to respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
there also can be no assurance that the company s new products will be accepted by the market 
moreover  the end markets for the company s new products  such as the communications and computer markets  are subject to rapid technological change and there can be no assurance that as such markets change the company s product offerings will remain current and suitable for them 
intellectual property the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its manufacturing processes  products and development and testing tools 
the company seeks patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which it believes such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to the company 
the company currently holds united states patents on semiconductor devices and methods with various expiration dates  none earlier than may the company has applications for six united states patents currently pending 
the company also holds one foreign patent 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and there can be no assurance that its current patents or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
the company may in the future be subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies 
although the company is not currently a party to any material litigation  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that any of the company s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patents  maskwork rights  or copyrights on certain of the company s products and technologies 
although the company is not currently a party to any material litigation  in the event a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license relating to such intellectual property was not available on commercially reasonable terms  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to the company and diversion of its resources  may also be necessary to enforce patents or other intellectual property rights of the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the occurrence of litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
competition the analog semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in the analog market for standard products include product features  performance  price  the timing of product introductions  the emergence of new computer standards  quality and customer support 
the company believes that it competes favorably in each of these areas 
because the standard products market for analog integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in various product markets 
the company s principal competitors include linear technology corporation  maxim integrated products and harris semiconductor in one or more of its product areas 
other competitors include motorola  national semiconductor corporation  unitrode corporation and certain japanese manufacturers 
each of these companies has substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
due to the increasing demands for analog circuits  the company expects continued competition from existing analog circuit suppliers and the entry of new competition 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of the company s products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
backlog the company s backlog consists of distributor and oem customer orders required to be shipped within six months following the order date 
customers may generally cancel or reschedule orders to purchase products without significant penalty to the customer 
as a result  the quantities of the company s products to be delivered and their delivery schedules are frequently revised by customers to reflect changes in their needs 
since backlog can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty  the company does not believe its backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees  of whom were engaged in manufacturing including testing  quality and materials functions  in research and development  in marketing and sales  and in finance and administration 
of such employees  are located in hong kong  are located in europe  and the remainder in the united states 
as part of the wafer fabrication facility closure  the company anticipates that approximately manufacturing employees will be laid off in mountain view during the first two quarters of the company s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
the company believes that its employee relations are good 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon its people 
this includes the continued service of its executive officers  management teams  and all other technical personnel 
the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel is a challenge in today s competitive market place 
the loss of the services of any key personnel  and or the company s inability to successfully recruit qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel

item description of property the company s main executive  administrative  and technical offices are located in a  square foot facility in mountain view  california 
the lease on this facility expires in december the company also leases  square feet of additional space in hong kong in which it conducts testing and from which it ships products to customers worldwide 
the lease on the hong kong facility expires in july the company believes that its existing facilities are adequate to meet its needs for at least the next months 
federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals and gases used in the company s manufacturing process and on the facility occupied by the company 
the company no longer produces wafers in the mountain view facility and believes that its past activities conformed to all environmental and land use regulations applicable to its operations 
the company acquired the semiconductor manufacturing operations of teledyne  inc previously conducted at the company s facility 
the semiconductor manufacturing operations conducted by teledyne components at the facility allegedly contaminated the soil and groundwater of the facility and the groundwater of properties located down gradient of the facility 
although the company was indemnified by teledyne as part of the acquisition transaction against  among other things  any liabilities arising from such contamination  there can be no assurance that claims will not be made against the company or that such indemnification will be available or will provide meaningful protection at the time any such claim is brought 
to the extent the company is subject to a claim which is not covered by the indemnity from teledyne or as to which teledyne is unable to provide indemnification  the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
although the company may be considered a successor in interest to teledyne s operations at the mountain view facility  the company believes that it is unlikely to be subject to any material environmental liabilities relating to the operations of the facility conducted by teledyne because i the company has received no notice from any regulatory authority or any other person claiming that the company is responsible for the contamination caused by teledyne or the cost of any clean up relating thereto and ii the company is indemnified by teledyne under the acquisition agreements and lease between the company and teledyne with respect to any such liabilities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk related factors set forth herein 
overview the company was founded in december as the result of a management buyout of the teledyne components division of teledyne industries inc the company designs  manufactures and sells a variety of analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
the company s product offerings are divided into four primary categories power management  thermal management data converters  and linear building blocks 
over the last several years  the company has been transitioning its product portfolio away from the legacy products associated with the teledyne division to higher value proprietary solutions 
as a result  the company s current product offering consists of both proprietary and second source products 
while the primary emphasis is developing proprietary products  the company does offer second source products to enhance its total product portfolio 
average selling prices for the company s proprietary products have generally tended to decline at a slower rate than have those for the company s second source products  which are more susceptible to competitive pricing pressures 
the company generally recognizes higher gross margins on its proprietary products than on its second source products 
as the company transitioned from the legacy products manufactured using older process technology  it became necessary to develop a source of supply for more advanced wafer processing technology for its newer  proprietary products 
this transition began at a time when advanced semiconductor capacity was in short supply and long term forecasts for additional capacity was not improving 
therefore  in november  the company entered into certain agreements with ic works  inc  a privately held wafer foundry company 
pursuant to such agreements  the company purchased million of preferred stock of ic works and provided million in capital equipment 
in return for this investment  telcom received a guarantee of submicron wafer capacity at specified prices for a period of five years  projected to start in late since then  the wafer capacity shortage projected in late diminished 
since late  substantial foundry capacity has been available worldwide while overall demand has not increased proportionately 
consequently  wafer pricing has decreased dramatically  which has changed the economic viability of the foundry business in which the company invested 
the ic works wafer foundry was subsequently sold to a captive supplier and as a result  in  the company recorded a loss of million on its foundry investment which consists of a million write down of the preferred stock  a loss on the sale of the equipment of million  and 
million of costs associated with prepayment penalties on financing of the equipment and legal fees 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  in the fourth quarter of  the company sold the million of equipment at ic works for million and invested an additional million in preferred stock of ic works 
this agreement terminates the company s operating agreement with ic works 
in august  the company announced its plans to shut down its five inch wafer fabrication facility in mountain view  california and use third party foundries for all of its wafer fabrication 
this change was desirable because of continuing market conditions that made it more economical to purchase wafers than to produce them internally 
a majority of the company s new products that have been developed in the past year utilize sub micron wafer technology and are currently fabricated by outside foundries 
all other remaining wafers were fabricated in the mountain view facility 
in january  the wafer fabrication facility was shut down 
the fabrication of wafers is in the process of being transferred to third party foundries and it is anticipated that the transfer will be complete prior to the end of the first quarter of in connection with the closure of its wafer fabrication facility  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million 
restructuring costs for the mountain view  california fabrication facility were million  while other one time charges totaled 
million 
the restructuring charge includes a write down of fabrication equipment of million  costs associated with idle facility space of million  employee severance costs of 
million and clean up and environmental related charges of 
million 
the other one time charges included the write down of 
million of certain test equipment in hong kong  the write down of certain equipment in mountain view totaling 
million  and 
million related to certain licensing and royalty costs  offset by a decrease of 
million in amounts previously accrued due to a change in the company s employee sabbatical policy 
net income from operations  excluding these charges  was million for or 
in earnings per share 
including these charges  the net loss was million 
the company expects annual savings of approximately million on completion of the restructuring activities 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of proprietary and second source products sold  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  the company s access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if the company is unable to introduce new products with higher margins  maintain its product mix between proprietary and second source products  or reduce manufacturing cost to offset decreases in the prices of its existing products  then the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
since most of the company s backlog is cancelable without penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
customer demand remains highly unpredictable and variances to the forecast can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of high fixed costs on the semiconductor industry  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company has experienced and may in the future experience material adverse fluctuations in its operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which have in the past and would in the future materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data of the company as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative loss on foundry investment restructuring and other total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income expense  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and net sales 
net sales in were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower average selling prices caused by product mix and a change by motorola from a device which had a higher average sales price to a device with a lower average sales price for the same application 
net sales in for the company s geographical areas of the united states  asia and europe accounted for   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  in sales to the company s three largest oem customers  motorola  intel and compaq were million or  million or  and million or  respectively  of net sales in compared to million or  million or and million or  respectively  of net sales in gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was caused by decreased production volume in the company s wafer fabrication facility due to lower demand  a decrease in unit selling prices for products sold to motorola  and an additional charge related to surplus inventory related to the closure of the company s wafer fabrication facility 
the company s ability to increase gross margins will depend on the successful introduction of its new proprietary products and controlling its manufacturing costs 
thus  future wafer costs will depend on the volume and availability of wafers from the company s wafer fabrication foundries 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in  compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in research and development expenses  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributable an increase in design engineers and product engineers and the costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of computer aided design cad systems for design engineers

income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in at an effective rate of negative compared to million in at an effective rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the non deductibility of certain foundry investment losses and a tax charge relating to the repatriation of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings  offset by an increase in the valuation allowance relating to the company s net deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million or  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales volume in the company s power management product line

loss on foundry investment 
in november  the company entered into certain agreements with ic works 
pursuant to these agreements  in the company purchased million of preferred stock of ic works and provided million in capital equipment 
in return for this investment  the company received a guarantee of submicron wafer capacity at specified prices for a period of five years  projected to start in late in  the company recorded a loss of million on its foundry investment which consists of a million write down of the preferred stock  a loss on the sale of the equipment of million  and 
million of costs associated with prepayment penalties on financing of the equipment and legal fees

net interest income decreased from  in to an expense of  in  reflecting higher interest expense associated with equipment financing 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in at an effective rate of compared to an income tax benefit of  in at an effective rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due to the non deductibility of certain foundry investment losses and a tax charge relating to repatriation of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings

at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the company invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements of which million was for purchases of capital equipment pursuant to an agreement with ic works in the company financed part of this investment through notes payable  which increased million on a net basis 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  the company invested million in preferred stock of ic works in in  the company generated approximately million from operating activities  primarily from income before the loss on foundry investment  depreciation of million and a net increase of million in working capital items 
the net increase in working capital primarily reflects a decrease of income tax receivable of million  due to collection of tax refunds recorded in the prior year  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in taxes payable of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable from higher fourth quarter sales of million  and an increase in sensor product inventory of million 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  in the fourth quarter of  the company sold the million of equipment at ic works for million and invested an additional million in preferred stock of ic works 
this agreement terminates the company s operating agreement with ic works and its wafer production arrangement was amended to allow the company to purchase wafers for a period of time prior to finding an alternative supplier  up to april in  the company invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company financed million of this investment through notes payable and paid million in principal payments of which million was for equipment sold as part of the ic works agreement and million was principal payments on other equipment financing for prior years 
in  the company generated approximately million of cash from operating activities primarily from income before restructuring and other charges  depreciation of million and a net increase of 
million in working capital items 
the net increase in working capital primarily reflects decreases in accounts receivable of

million and deferred income taxes of 
million 
in  the company invested or used million to fund capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects capital expenditures of million in as of december   the company had no material commitments related to such expenditures 
the company also used million of cash to repurchase company s common stock for million and to pay down notes payable debt by million 
these were partially offset by cash generated from the sale of stock through the employee stock option and stock purchase plans of million 
the company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations and its existing financing sources will be sufficient to support its operating and capital needs for at least the next months 
any major change in the nature of the company s business  such as the acquisition of products  the need for significant new capital expenditures or the acquisition of an existing business  could change the company s capital requirements 
to the extent the company requires additional cash  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has identified its year risk in four categories internal information systems  internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology  product compliance  and external noncompliance by third parties 
internal information systems 
during  the company inventoried all of its mission critical systems  programs and databases 
such systems  if failure occurred  could result in a disruption in business operations that could have a material adverse affect on the company s operations 
during  the company completed an assessment of these mission critical systems 
as a result of the assessment  the company does not anticipate any significant issues from its internal information systems 
certain software packages will require upgrading to year compliant versions 
these upgrades should be completed by june the costs incurred to date for the assessment performed as well as the costs to upgrade to the year compliant software packages are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
these expenses will continue to be expensed in the periods incurred 
since the company has completed its assessment and is in the process of making the necessary changes  the company has not developed a contingency plan for its internal information systems 
internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology 
during  the company completed an assessment of its non financial software and imbedded chip technology regarding the impact of the year on such non financial systems as manufacturing equipment  and security equipment 
as a result of the assessment  the company does not anticipate any significant issues from its non financial software and imbedded chip technology 
if the company is unable to achieve year compliance for its major non financial systems  the year could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs incurred to date for the assessment performed and any anticipated costs to be incurred in the future related to internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations and will continue to be expensed in the periods incurred 
since the company has completed its assessment and has not found any significant issues  the company has not developed a contingency plan for its internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology 
product compliance 
the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets a wide portfolio of high performance integrated circuits 
during  the company completed an assessment of its current products regarding its compliance with the year issue 
as a result of the assessment  the company believes its products are year compliant and does not anticipate any significant year compliance issues 
if the company s products were found not to be year compliant  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs incurred to date  for the assessment performed and any anticipated costs to be incurred in the future are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition and will continue to be expensed in the periods incurred 
since the company has completed its assessment and has not found any significant issues  the company has not developed a contingency plan for its products 
external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting its critical suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
it is expected that full identification of any noncompliance issues in this area will be completed in the third quarter of to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company intends to change suppliers  service providers or contractors to those who have demonstrated year readiness 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors 
the costs incurred to date for the assessment performed and any anticipated costs to be incurred in the future are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations and will continue to be expensed in the periods incurred 
in the event that any of the company s significant customers and suppliers do not successfully achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them with new customers or alternate suppliers  the company s business or operations could be materially adversely affected 
during  the company incurred costs of 
million related to year issues 
the company estimates that it will incur costs of approximately 
million during for costs related to year issues 
market risk disclosure interest rate risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
at december   the company s investment portfolio is comprised of municipal government securities that mature within one year 
the company places investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain of the company s sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to the company s consolidated results of operations 
a move in local currencies against the us dollar as of december  would have an immaterial effect on the company s pretax earnings over the next fiscal year
