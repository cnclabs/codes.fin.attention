item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis represents an overview of the results of operations and financial condition of wesbanco  inc this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  presented in part ii  item of this document 
certain information in management s discussion and other statements contained in this report  which are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements  including without limitation  the effect of changing regional and national economic conditions  changes in interest rates  credit risks of commercial  real estate  and consumer loan customers and their lending activities  changes in federal and state regulations  the presence in the corporation s market area of competitors with greater financial resources than the corporation  or other unanticipated external developments materially impacting the corporation s operational and financial performance 
overview earnings for were million or per share  up from million or per share in the increase in earnings was highlighted by an increase in activity charges and trust fees  a million gain on the sale of union bank of tyler county  a moderate improvement in net interest income driven primarily by balance sheet growth  gains on sales of securities and a reduction in the provision for loan losses reflecting improved credit quality 
partially offsetting these improvements to earnings was an increase in non interest expenses  which resulted primarily from the business combination with commercial bancshares 
the average balance sheet reflected increases in average earning assets of and average interest bearing liabilities of between and growth in earning assets occurred in the securities portfolio early in the year  however  by the third and fourth quarter had shifted to business and mortgage loans 
growth in interest bearing liabilities was affected early in the year by increases in wesbanco s prime rate money market deposits and good neighbor banking cd s 
this trend moderated during the second half of the year 
during  wesbanco continued its expansion efforts through its business combination with commercial bancshares  acquisitions of hunter agency and simons insurance agency  and the signing of an agreement to merge heritage bank of harrison county into a wesbanco affiliate 
additionally  the corporation initiated a stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to one million shares of wesbanco common stock  introduced two new wesmark mutual funds and began extensive construction projects  renovating a building to expand office capacity in wheeling  wv and constructing a new branch facility in charleston  wv 
historical financial results have been restated to reflect wesbanco s pooling of interests business combination with commercial bancshares 
however  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the divestiture of union bank of tyler county on june   as well as the purchase acquisitions of vandalia national corporation  acquired december   and shawnee bank  inc  acquired june  the purchase acquisitions and divestiture impacted performance comparisons between and prior periods 
where material  the impact of these events is discussed 
results of operations net interest income following a period of stability during much of through the third quarter of  short term interest rates declined during the fourth quarter of  reflecting the federal reserve s action to lower the federal funds rate basis points 
long term interest rates steadily declined during and wesbanco and most other banks reacted to these declining trends by lowering its base lending rate in the fourth quarter of to from 
previously  the base rate had not changed since early taxable equivalent net interest income rose million or during  caused by deposit growth early in the year and strong third and fourth quarter loan growth which changed the mix of earning assets 
average earning assets increased million or in compared to the net yield on earning assets taxable equivalent net interest income as a percentage of earning assets decreased basis points during  reflecting a slowdown in loan demand early in the year  a shift in deposits to higher priced products  and a decline in interest rates 
taxable equivalent interest income rose million or during  reflecting growth in average securities of million or 
the taxable equivalent yield on average securities decreased basis points from to during the year  a result of maturities in higher yielding securities and lower rate reinvestment opportunities 
average loan growth was moderate for the year  increasing only million or 
average loan yields decreased approximately basis points to for compared to for loan growth during the second half of  occurring primarily in the mortgage and business loan portfolios  changed the mix of assets and stabilized the net yield on earning assets in the fourth quarter 
management expects the strong fourth quarter loan demand to extend through however  the positive net interest margin impact expected from this loan growth will be softened by competitive pressure to make interest rate adjustments on loan and deposit products 
interest expense increased million or during  driven by growth in prime rate money market deposits 
during the year  average interest bearing liabilities increased million or over average interest bearing demand deposits  which include prime rate mmda s  increased million or over the prior year  while average savings balances declined by million or  creating a change in the mix of deposits

enhancements to the monitoring system for collecting fees primarily contributed to the increase over net securities gains increased million or in comparison to due to sales of callable agency and mortgage backed securities during the third and fourth quarters of during this period of declining interest rates  the corporation was able to realize gains while minimizing the risk of reinvestment at lower yields 
other expenses other expenses  excluding special charges of million related to wesbanco s business combination with commercial bancshares  increased million or over  due to technology enhancement projects and the purchase acquisition of shawnee 
these factors were partially offset by reductions in other expenses resulting from the sale of union on june  and improved operating efficiencies occurring primarily through the integration of commercial bancshares  which includes the closing of four offices 
during the first half of  wesbanco incurred and paid approximately million in expenses special charges related to its business combination with commercial bancshares 
these special charges consisted of million in salary and employee benefit costs and million in conversion  integration and professional expenses 
conversion and integration costs included the conversion of commercial s mainframe computer systems into the wesbanco systems during the second quarter of technology enhancements during  which included upgrades to the corporation s wide area network and conversion of the trust department s operating system  affected the other expense categories through overtime  equipment  consulting and training costs

should wesbanco not prevail  approximately million in federal and state income tax payments would be accelerated 
there would be no material effect on net income of the corporation

at december  the average yield of the available for sale portfolio was  with an average maturity of years 
for the same period  the held to maturity portfolio had an average yield of and an average maturity of years 
unrealized after tax gains on available for sale securities market value adjustments increased to million as of december  from million as of december   reflecting a decrease in long term interest rates during the year 
these market value adjustments represent temporary fluctuations resulting from changes in market rates in relation to average yields in the available for sale portfolio 
wesbanco can adjust the volatility of the market value adjustment by managing both the volume of securities classified as available for sale and average maturities 
if securities are held to their maturity dates  no gain or loss would be realized

loans loan portfolio loans  net of unearned income at december  increased million or compared to december   reflecting strong third and fourth quarter growth in mortgage  home equity and business loans 
this period of growth followed a slowdown in loan demand that started in the fourth quarter of the slowdown reflected seasonal adjustments and the economy in the upper ohio valley  as well as competitive pressure in the marketplace to lower interest rates on loan products 
commercial loans  at december   increased million  while personal loans  net of unearned income  decreased million  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in personal loans reflected a continuation of competitive pressures and tightening of credit standards 
real estate loans  which declined during the first quarter  increased steadily throughout the remainder of  driven by wesbanco s home equity products and attractive pricing of residential mortgage loan products 
wesbanco mortgage company  the corporation s mortgage banking affiliate  originates residential mortgage loans and sells its fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
for  the mortgage company increased its loan originations over to approximately million 
loans outstanding  including loans held for sale  are as follows december  in thousands loans commercial      real estate construction      real estate      personal      loans held for sale   total loans      gross of allowance for loan losses and unearned income on personal loans 
wesbanco s real estate loans  at of total loans  comprise the single largest loan type in the portfolio 
this category consists generally of conventional adjustable and fixed rate residential mortgages  and home equity loans located within the bank s general market areas 
the risks associated with real estate lending are principally influenced by real property values which are affected by the general economic conditions in each bank s market area 
each bank within the corporation has standard loan policies governing extensions of real estate construction loans 
except for construction of spec homes by reliable builders  real estate construction loans are only made when the affiliate banks also commit to the permanent financing of the project or have a takeout commitment from another lender for the permanent loan 
loans held for sale consists of residential mortgage loans and are valued at the lower of aggregate cost or market value 
personal loans represent approximately of total loans and consist primarily of indirect vehicle loans originated through automobile dealers and credit card outstanding balances 
these loans are a smaller balance  homogeneous group of loans which are not concentrated in a specific market area 
risks in this lending category include the possibility of general economic downturn which may cause an increase in credit losses 
the loan loss policy for consumer installment lending requires a charge off if the loan reaches delinquency days 
any payments subsequent to charge off are reflected as recoveries 
commercial loans  including commercial loans secured by real estate  represent of total loans 
these loans are not concentrated in any single industry  but reflect a broad range of businesses in west virginia and eastern ohio 
the credit risk associated with commercial lending is principally influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on the borrower s operations  mitigated by collateral values 
renewals of commercial loans above certain pre approved dollar limits must be reviewed by a credit committee or senior management prior to extension of maturity dates or rollover of the loan into a new loan 
renewals of commercial loans below specified lending limitations may be approved by the respective bank loan officer 
the following table presents the approximate maturities of loans other than personal loans  residential mortgages  and loans held for sale  for all affiliate banks as of december  after one in one year through after in thousands year or less five years five years commercial    real estate construction    other real estate    total    fixed rates    variable rates    total    wesbanco banks follow lending policies which require substantial down payments along with current market appraisals on the collateral when the loans are originated 
the majority of loans are either secured by real property or personal property 
all affiliate banks generally recognize interest income on the accrual basis  except for certain loans which are placed on a nonaccrual status  when in the opinion of management  doubt exists as to collectability 
all banks must conform to the policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the office of the comptroller of currency which state that banks may not accrue interest on any loan on which either the principal or interest is past due days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status  interest income may be recognized as cash payments are received 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans classified as impaired nonaccrual  renegotiated and certain loans internally classified as substandard or doubtful and other real estate owned 
at december   non performing assets decreased to million or of total loans from million or of total loans at december  nonaccrual loans are generally secured by collateral believed to have adequate market values to protect against significant losses 
management anticipates that of the million in nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   approximately million will be paid off during the first four months of with no additional writedowns 
these loans are subject to agreed upon contracts or agreements between the borrower and other independent parties which will result in the sale of the business or liquidation of the collateral for amounts sufficient to pay the remaining balances in full 
however  there can be no assurances that such events will be consummated in the timeframe  or in the manner  anticipated based on current circumstances 
the corporation continues to monitor its non performing assets to ensure against deterioration in collateral values 
non performing assets and secured loans which are in the process of collection but are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal are as follows december  in thousands nonaccrual personal commercial      real estate     total      renegotiated personal commercial     real estate   total     other classified loans commercial    real estate total     total non performing loans      other real estate owned      total non performing assets      percentage of non performing assets to loans outstanding past due days or more personal    commercial      real estate    total past due days or more      includes loans internally classified as doubtful and substandard as defined by banking regulations that meet the definition of impaired loans 
at december   non performing loans  which included all impaired loans increased million over the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the million decrease in other real estate owned resulted from the sale of a large commercial real estate property 
at december   the increase of million in nonperforming loans over december  was primarily attributable to a commercial loan that was classified as substandard under the definition of an impaired loan 
at december   nonaccrual loans decreased million primarily due to the reclassification of a commercial real estate loan to other real estate owned 
the action was taken on november  by an affiliate through a transfer by deed in lieu of foreclosure on a parcel of commercial property 
contributing to the increase in renegotiated loans during were certain performing loans classified as impaired  in accordance with fas no 
nonaccrual loans are generally secured by collateral believed to have adequate market values to protect the corporation from significant losses 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future charge offs 
the allowance is reduced by losses  net of recoveries  and increased by charging a provision to operations to maintain the allowance at a level determined appropriate by management 
there can be no assurance that wesbanco will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance 
at december   the allowance for loan losses to loans was  down from as of december  net charge offs in were million compared to million in the provision for loan losses was million in  down million from the increase in loan charge offs during resulted primarily from losses of million recognized on two business loans 
the increase in loan charge offs during reflected a rise in personal bankruptcies in wesbanco s market area 
the provision for loan losses is based on periodic management evaluation of the loan portfolio as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions  net loans charged off  past loan experience  current delinquency factors  changes in the character of the loan portfolio  specific problem loans and other factors 
the historical relationship between average loans  loan losses and recoveries and the provision for loan losses is presented in the following table for the years ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses of acquired sold banks net loans charged off commercial     real estate personal      total loans charged off      recovery of loans previously charged off commercial real estate personal total recoveries  net loans charged off      provision for loan losses      ending balance allowance for loan losses      ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding for the period

specific reserves are established when warranted for impaired commercial loans over  the determination of specific reserves takes into consideration the anticipated future cash flows available to pay the loan and or the realizable value of the collateral pledged and other secondary repayment sources  if any 
for consumer loans and all other commercial loans not specifically reserved  management uses historical net charge off experience relative to loans outstanding to predict future losses 
management further allocates against the reserve  when appropriate  based on economic conditions  changes in underwriting standards or practices  delinquency and other trends in the portfolio  specific industry conditions  the results of recent internal loan reviews or regulatory examinations  and other relevant factors that impact the loan portfolio

the banks also extend credit to businesses of all types to purchase assets  including commercial real estate  or to finance expansion  as well as revolving lines of credit to finance operations and short term loans for other purposes 
credit risk  that is the risk that a borrower will default on a loan  is inherent in all lending activities 
wesbanco s primary goal in managing credit risk is to minimize the impact of default by an individual borrower or group of borrowers 
credit risk is managed both through the initial underwriting process as well as through ongoing monitoring and administration of the loan portfolio 
wesbanco has established standard credit policies to provide for consistent underwriting of loans as well as procedures to assist in maintaining and monitoring the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
these standard policies and procedures are to be followed by all its banking subsidiaries 
credit policy establishes underwriting guidelines for all types of loans  lending authorities  exposure limits to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers  as well as loan type  industry  and geographic concentrations  and loan portfolio administration procedures 
underwriting guidelines require an appropriate evaluation of the creditworthiness of each borrower  the adequacy of collateral  if any  to secure the loan  and other factors unique to each loan that may increase or mitigate its risks 
individual lending officers approve loans up to predetermined limits depending on the type of loan 
loans above individual lending authorities require approval by a loan committee or the board of directors  depending on the amount of credit exposure to the particular borrower 
exceptions to credit policy are permissible  but only after careful evaluation of the risks associated with each exception and the factors that mitigate those risks 
subsequent to origination  the process used to measure and monitor the level of credit risk is dependent upon the type of loan 
consumer loans  including residential mortgages  are generally smaller in amount and spread over a larger number of diverse individual borrowers 
accordingly  credit risk in the consumer portfolio can generally be managed effectively by monitoring the level and trend of delinquent loans  and economic conditions that may impact a borrower or group of borrowers  or a particular geographic territory 
conversely  commercial loans can be extended for substantially larger amounts and the potential for loss as a result of default by any one borrower can be significant 
therefore  credit risk in the commercial portfolio also requires periodic review of large borrowing relationships and a loan grading system to help management identify adverse trends and evaluate the quality of the portfolio 
wesbanco maintains a loan grading system that categorizes commercial loans according to their level of credit risk 
all commercial loans are assigned a grade at their inception  and grades are regularly reviewed and evaluated for all commercial borrowers with credit exposure above  when the risk of a loan increases beyond that which is considered acceptable in the normal course of lending  its grade is adjusted to reflect the change in its risk 
classified loans are those loans that exhibit clear and defined weaknesses that may jeopardize their recoverability 
loans are classified as substandard when they are no longer adequately protected by the sound net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged 
substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank may sustain some loss 
loans are classified as doubtful when the risk that a loss may occur has increased  or at least a portion of the loan may require charge off if liquidated at present 
both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent or on nonaccrual status and may also include loans whose terms have been renegotiated 
the loan grading process provides management with an effective early warning system of potential problems and also facilitates evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
wesbanco also maintains a formal  ongoing internal loan review program  which concentrates principally on commercial loans  to monitor credit risk 
the loan review process further identifies areas that require management s attention  evaluates the adequacy of loan administration and documentation  helps to ensure compliance with loan policies  and validates the reliability of the loan grading system 
there are no significant loans made to customers outside the general market area of each affiliate bank except for one lending relationship secured in part by an assignment of trust assets 
at times  in order to maintain loan volumes  loans are purchased from correspondent banks 
these loans aggregate less than  as of december  each bank within the corporation follows its usual loan analysis procedures before a determination is made to purchase loans from correspondent banks 
there were no loan concentrations in excess of of total consolidated loans 
management s review of the loan portfolio has not indicated any material amount of loans  not disclosed in the accompanying tables and discussions which are known to have possible credit problems which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of each borrower to comply with their present loan repayment terms 
periodic review of significant loans are completed by personnel independent of the loan function 
deposits deposits increased million or between december  and wesbanco experienced strong deposit growth for the first half of  primarily through its prime rate money market accounts and good neighbor banking cd s  followed by a declining trend in the second half of the year 
the declining trend resulted from increased competition for funds and managing the balance sheet during a slowdown in loan demand 
an increase in average interest bearing deposits of million or reflected the early year growth in interest bearing deposit balances 
however  in comparing year end outstanding balances  a decrease of million in interest bearing deposits reflected the moderating trend during the second half of during a change in deposit mix similar to trends continued  as customers shifted funds from savings products into higher yielding prime rate money market accounts 
this change in deposit mix has contributed to a narrowing of the net yield on earning assets  as the average deposit rate remained unchanged from levels  while the earning asset yield declined basis points 
during  management believes the change in deposit mix along with a moderate growth trend will continue  as customers shop for higher rate investment alternatives in a low interest rate environment 
maturities of certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more are as follows december  in thousands maturity under three months   three to six months   six to twelve months   over twelve months   total   interest expense on certificates of deposit of  or more was approximately  in   in  and  in capital adequacy shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  due to the retention of earnings and a net increase in the market value adjustment on securities available for sale 
these additions to equity were partially offset by an increase in treasury stock  reflecting shares acquired through a stock repurchase plan initiated during the fourth quarter of on october   wesbanco announced a stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to million shares of wesbanco common stock in the open market 
as of december   wesbanco had purchased  shares under the plan 
the shares are being purchased for general corporate purposes which may include potential acquisitions  dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans 
timing  price and quantity of purchases are at the discretion of the corporation and the plan may be discontinued or suspended at any time 
ending primary capital to assets for was compared to for  reflecting wesbanco s strong capital position 
the relatively high level of capital coupled with strong earnings has enabled wesbanco to continue its steady increase in dividends declared per share 
dividend payout ratios over the last five years reflect the growth in dividends  increasing to in from in the corporation announced cash dividend increases in the first quarter of and on february   the quarterly dividend per share  payable april   was increased to 
representing the fourteenth consecutive year of common stock cash dividend increases for wesbanco 
during the previous year  the quarterly dividend per share was increased to 
from  payable april  wesbanco is subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weigted assets and off balance sheet instruments 
wesbanco  and its banking subsidiaries  maintain tier  total capital and leverage ratios well above minimum regulatory levels 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information on capital amounts  ratios and minimum regulatory requirements 
interest rate management and liquidity interest rate management measures and monitors the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in the level of interest rates 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco and its banking subsidiaries review their interest rate sensitivity on a periodic basis 
this review is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities at a specific point in time gap and by using a simulation model to estimate the impact on net interest income of changing interest rates over a twelve month projected period 
at december   the corporation s gap position is summarized in the table below under three six nine over three to six to nine months to one in thousands months months months one year year total rate sensitive assets due from banks interest bearing   federal funds sold   investment securities       loans       total rate sensitive assets       rate sensitive liabilities money market deposit accounts     savings and now accounts   certificates of deposit       other borrowings      total rate sensitive liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap      securities are categorized above by expected maturity at amortized cost 
the liability sensitive position in the under three month time period is primarily a result of million in savings and now account balances 
interest rates on these deposit instruments are subject to periodic adjustment at management s discretion 
beginning in  wesbanco experienced an increase in its short term liability sensitive position due to growth in its prime rate money market product 
in an effort to manage this additional interest sensitivity  wesbanco has entered into various interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling approximately million 
the swap agreements effectively fixed the interest rate on a portion of the money market deposits for an average life of years 
the gap is a relatively simple analysis of the corporation s consolidated balance sheet  but does not quantify the magnitude of the interest rate risk in terms of changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
therefore  management also considers the results of net interest income simulations using a variety of interest rate changes 
key assumptions used in income simulation include loan and deposit growth  pricing  interest sensitivity  and the level of interest rate or balance changes on deposit products with no stated maturity such as savings and now deposits 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future anticipated pricing behavior 
based on the results of the income simulation  at december   the corporation would expect an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease of million from an immediate and sustained basis point increase and decrease  respectively  in interest rates over a twelve month projection period 
the corporation manages its liquidity position to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customer needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its strong core deposit base 
the growth in deposits is somewhat dependent upon interest rates of competitive financial instruments 
short term liquidity is maintained through the use of federal funds sold  which represents one day investments and cash balances 
as of december   federal funds sold and cash balances were million or of total assets as compared to million or of total assets as of december  the decrease in short term liquidity resulted from a million decrease in federal funds sold  reflecting loan growth and an increase in investment securities 
additional short term liquidity is maintained through investments with expected maturities of less than one year which  during  approximate million or of total assets 
as of december  the corporation had outstanding commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business approximating million 
on an historical basis only a small portion of these commitments result in expended funds 
the corporation has planned additions to fixed assets of approximately million during comparison of versus net income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to  reflecting an increase in operating expenses and the provision for loan losses  partially offset by increases in trust fees  net interest income and an alternative minimum tax credit which reduced the federal income tax provision 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased million or over  resulting from average growth in earning assets of million or and average growth in interest bearing liabilities of million or 
average balance sheet growth was driven by prime rate money market deposit accounts and good neighbor banking cd s 
this deposit growth was used to fund growth in business and mortgage loans 
purchase acquisitions contributed million to the increase in average earning assets and million to the increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the taxable equivalent net yield on earning assets approximated levels at 
the provision for loan losses increased to million from million in  reflecting an increase in net charge offs which resulted from a rise in personal bankruptcies in wesbanco s market area and an analysis of risks in commercial bancshare s loan portfolio 
other income  excluding securities transactions  increased million or over the increase was primarily due to a million or increase in trust fees over other expenses increased million or over the increase resulted from purchase acquisitions and commercial bancshares acquisition related expenses  which totaled million and million  respectively

year readiness disclosure the year issue primarily results from computer software or hardware that is date sensitive and may recognize as the year instead of the year which may cause system failure  miscalculations and other temporary disruptions of operations 
wesbanco s year task force  which includes independent consultants and an outside board member  has completed the awareness  assessment  remediation and of the validation and implementation phases of this project

accounting systems for loans  deposits and general ledger have been certified as year compliant by an independent third party 
vendors of the other systems  noted above  have represented to wesbanco that applicable year testing has been performed and they have determined their systems to be year compliant 
wesbanco has elected to perform in house testing  including future date testing  on of all software and banking equipment 
currently  wesbanco is complete with testing its mission critical application software and complete with its overall testing schedule 
testing of existing systems is projected to be substantially complete by march   however  planned system enhancements during the second and third quarters of  will be tested subsequent to their installation

all exceptions have been documented and are expected to be resolved by march  large commercial customers and non it vendors have been assessed for their capability to resolve the year issues and attain compliance 
risk ratings have been assigned to customers and non it vendors  with high risk accounts being revisited on a periodic basis 
year issues and readiness are considered and evaluated for all new large customers and non it vendors

contingency plans  which set forth procedures for handling the most likely worst case scenario  are currently being developed 
these plans include  a remediation plan for all mission critical software applications  plans for all main customer products  services and trust fiduciary accounts  and a liquidity funding contingency plan to provide adequate cash availability and the access to cash sources and credit lines 
these contingency plans are expected to be completed by march  and tested by june  contingency plans will be continuously monitored and updated as conditions change throughout and into the year the trust investments function trust of wesbanco has addressed year issues directed at validating its main operating accounting program for year compliance as well as evaluating accounts held in a fiduciary capacity for significant year risks 
an independent consultant was hired to direct the year validation of trust s main operating accounting software application  a vendor supplied and maintained program 
this application has been effectively tested  found to be year compliant and is fully implemented 
trust is executing a plan to evaluate and or assess fiduciary account holdings with the objective of locating fiduciary accounts that may contain significant year risks to customers 
wesbanco will continue to evaluate fiduciary accounts throughout  however  expects the majority of the evaluation to be complete by september  although wesbanco has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program  management believes it is taking the appropriate steps to identify and resolve year issues in a timely manner 
wesbanco anticipates modifications to third party systems and applicable testing will be complete by the end of the first quarter  but has no means of ensuring that third parties suppliers and major commercial customers with whom it interacts will be year ready 
the inability of those parties to complete their year process could impact the financial results of wesbanco 
contingency plans will address the uncertainty of third parties readiness 
plans to complete year compliance are based upon management s best estimates  which are derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including availability of certain internal and external resources  the ability of wesbanco s larger commercial customers to become year compliant and the readiness of strategic third party vendors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from these plans due to unforeseen circumstances
