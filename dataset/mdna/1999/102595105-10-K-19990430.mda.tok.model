industry overview travel services industry 
the travel services industry in which the company competes includes convenience stores that may or may not offer gasoline  and fast food and full service restaurants located along rural interstate highways 
the company believes that the current trend in the travel services industry is toward strategic pairings at a single location of complementary products that are noncompetitive  such as brand name gasoline and brand name fast food restaurants 
this concept  known as co branding  has recently seen greater acceptance by both traditional operators and larger petroleum companies 
the industry has also been characterized in recent periods by consolidation or closure of smaller operators 
the convenience store industry includes both traditional operators that focus primarily on the sale of food and beverages but also offer gasoline and large petroleum companies that offer food and beverages primarily to attract gasoline customers 
the restaurant segment of the travel services industry is highly competitive  most notably in the areas of consistency of quality  variety  price  location  speed of service  and effectiveness of marketing 
the major chains are aggressively increasing market penetration by opening new restaurants  including restaurants at special sites such as retail centers  travel centers and gasoline outlets 
smaller quick service restaurant chains and franchise operations are focusing on brand and image enhancement and co branding strategies 
outdoor advertising industry 
according to recent estimates by the outdoor advertising association of america oaaa  outdoor advertising generated total billboard revenues of approximately billion in  representing growth of approximately over outdoor advertising offers repetitive impact and a relatively low cost per thousand impressions as compared to broadcast media  newspapers  magazines and direct mail marketing  making it attractive to both local businesses targeting a specific geographic area or set of demographic characteristics and national advertisers seeking mass market support 
because outdoor advertising reaches potential customers close to the point of sale  restaurants  motels  service stations and similar businesses find outdoor advertising particularly effective 
repeated viewing by people traveling the same route on a daily basis makes outdoor advertising especially suitable for companies such as banks  insurance companies  and soft drink manufacturers that sell their products by promoting a particular image 
outdoor advertising services have recently expanded beyond billboards to include a wide variety of out of home advertising media  including advertising displays in shopping centers  malls  airports  stadiums  movie theaters and supermarkets  as well as on taxis  trains  buses and subways 
recent estimates published by the oaaa report that total out of home advertising revenues  including traditional billboard advertising  was approximately billion in the outdoor advertising industry uses three standardized display formats traditional bulletin style painted billboards with a typical face size of feet by feet  sheet posters with a typical face size of feet by feet and junior or sheet posters with a typical face size of feet by feet 
the physical advertising structure is generally owned by the outdoor advertising company and is built on locations either owned or leased by the operator or on which it has a permanent easement 
traditionally outdoor advertising displays are leased to advertisers on a unit basis 
advertising rates for outdoor advertising media are based on such factors as the size of the advertising display  visibility  cost of leasing  construction and maintenance and the number of people who have the opportunity to see the advertising message 
the outdoor advertising market is highly fragmented but is dominated in the large designated market areas by a few sizable firms  several of which are subsidiaries of diversified companies 
in addition to the large outdoor advertising firms  there are many smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local markets 
there has been a trend toward consolidation in the outdoor advertising industry in recent years and the company expects this trend to continue 
business strategy travel services business strategy 
the company opened its first travel center in and has since expanded to fourteen travel centers 
the company s travel centers are strategically located along well traveled interstate highways in arizona and new mexico where there are generally few gas stations  convenience stores or restaurants 
most of the company s travel centers offer food and beverages  ranging from ice cream and snack foods at some locations to full service restaurants at others 
the company s food service operations at seven of the company s fourteen travel centers operate under the dairy queen brazier or dairy queen trade names 
four of the company s travel centers operate under the stuckey s brand name 
the stuckey s specialty stores are family oriented shops that feature the stuckey s line of pecan confectioneries 
stuckey s is well known among travelers as a place to shop for souvenirs  gifts and toys and travel games for children 
the company s travel centers also offer brand name gasoline such as citgo  exxon  chevron  and diamond shamrock 
the company has been an authorized distributor of citgo petroleum corporation since october  effective july   the company also became an authorized distributor of exxon company  usa 
the company has converted one of its existing locations to an exxon station 
the travel center opened by the company on february  is also an exxon station 
the company has converted eight of its existing locations to citgo superpumper stations 
the company also intends to continue marketing citgo and exxon products to other retailers in arizona and new mexico 
the company s billboard advertising for its travel centers emphasizes the wide range of unique southwestern souvenirs and gifts available at the travel centers  as well as the availability of gasoline and food 
merchandise at each of the company s stores is offered at prices intended to suit the budgets and tastes of a diverse traveling population 
the merchandise ranges from inexpensive southwestern gifts and souvenirs to unique hand crafted jewelry  rugs  pottery  kachina dolls and other gifts crafted especially for the company by several native american tribes 
outdoor advertising business strategy 
the company operates over  revenue generating advertising display faces  primarily in arizona  new mexico and texas and  to a lesser extent  in colorado and oklahoma 
approximately of these display faces are traditional bulletin style and are assorted poster styles 
the company s bulletin style displays are located primarily on interstate highways  while the smaller poster sizes are typically used in local settings by advertisers who prefer to change the display message regularly 
the company s outdoor advertising displays are strategically located in rural and smaller metropolitan areas throughout the southwest  where the dispersion of population  outdoor lifestyles  and leading tourist destinations have created a strong dependence on highway travel 
the company began its outdoor advertising operations in and has grown into a regional leader in small to medium sized outdoor advertising markets 
the company offers its outdoor advertising customers a complete full service source for graphic design and painting for the outdoor billboards operated by the company 
as a result  the company is able to attract advertisers that have historically relied on other media in marketing their products and services 
the company believes it is one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in rural interstate markets in the southwest 
growth strategy travel centers 
the company is committed to expanding its travel center operations through internal development 
the company plans to further expand its travel center operations in popular tourist destinations  along heavily traveled interstate corridors and in smaller metropolitan areas 
the company believes that the co branding concept it has implemented at its travel centers has resulted in increased revenues  and the company intends to pursue opportunities to acquire rights to additional brand name products 
the following are the primary components of the company s strategy for expanding its travel center operations continuing to offer high quality brand name food and products in a clean  safe environment designed to appeal to travelers on interstate highways 
continuing to increase sales at existing locations through ongoing renovation and upgrading of facilities and the addition of new products and services 
pursuing complementary national food and or merchandise brands to further implement the company s co branding concept 
expanding the company s travel center operations through internal development and strategic acquisitions in key tourist destinations  along heavily traveled interstate highways and in smaller metropolitan areas 
gasoline wholesaling 
the company is an authorized citgo and exxon distributor 
citgo and exxon are among the top five petroleum producers in the united states 
the citgo distribution agreement allows the company to streamline its gasoline supply arrangements and take advantage of volume driven pricing by consolidating purchases from citgo 
the citgo distribution agreement had an initial three year term that expired september   and automatically renewed for a three year term through the exxon distribution agreement has a three year term that expires july  citgo s and exxon s ability to terminate or refuse to renew the agreement with the company is subject to the occurrence of certain events set forth in the petroleum marketing practices act  which events currently include bankruptcy  or breach of the agreement by the company  or termination by citgo or exxon of its petroleum marketing activities in the company s distribution area 
the terms of the distribution agreements require the company to purchase certain minimum quantities of gasoline during the term of the agreement  which includes gasoline purchased for sale at the company s travel centers 
since the effective date of the citgo distribution agreement  the company s purchases of citgo products have substantially exceeded the required minimum quantities 
since the effective date of the exxon agreement the company has not determined if certain minimum quantities have been met  however  the company believes it will exceed the required minimum quantities 
the company intends to continue to grow gasoline sales by focusing on the marketing of the citgo and exxon lines of petroleum products through the company s own travel centers  and as a wholesale provider to other gasoline retailers in the southwest 
outdoor advertising 
the company plans to increase its outdoor advertising operations through internal development as well as acquisition 
the company increased its inventory of billboard faces by in fiscal year and in fiscal year the company anticipates that it will be adding approximately new billboard faces per year to its operations through internal development  subject to the availability of necessary working capital and the company s ability to comply with applicable regulations 
in addition to internal development  the company plans to continue to focus on the expansion of its outdoor advertising operations through aggressive acquisitions at prices that reflect prudent cash flow multiples 
the company routinely engages in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions 
any such acquisitions would be subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements  appropriate financing arrangements  performance of due diligence  approval of the company s board of directors  and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions  including the receipt of third party consents 
consistent with its past practices  the company intends to pursue expansion into markets that are not included in the largest designated market areas 
the company believes that expansion along interstate highways and in smaller metropolitan areas permits the company to operate in areas where competition for site acquisitions is less intense  purchase prices are more favorable  and government regulations are generally less onerous 
the company s advertising customers consist largely of local and regional advertisers  resulting in a diverse client base and limiting reliance on national advertising clients 
unlike many of its competitors  the company does not rely to a significant extent upon tobacco advertisers  which are subject to increasing regulation 
the following table sets forth the categories of industries from which the company derived its outdoor advertising net revenues for the year ended january   and the respective percentages of such net revenues 
the top three business categories accounted for approximately of the company s total outdoor advertising net revenues 
no single advertiser accounted for more than of the company s total outdoor advertising net revenues in such period 
percentage of net advertising revenues by category hotels and motels restaurants travel entertainment retail consumer products government services automotive alcohol tobacco other total less than the company plans to expand its outdoor advertising operations primarily by continuing to develop the company s presence along interstate highways in its existing markets throughout the southwest 
increasing revenues from existing billboards by implementing programs that maximize advertising rates and occupancy levels 
expanding its operations within current markets through new billboard construction 
making strategic acquisitions of existing outdoor advertising assets of small to medium sized outdoor advertising operations in the less populated areas of the united states 
business operations travel center operations 
the company sells food  gasoline and merchandise through its fourteen travel centers located along two interstate highways i and i in arizona and new mexico 
these are key highways for travel to numerous tourist and recreational destinations as well as arteries for regional traffic among major southwestern cities 
all of the company s travel centers are open every day of the year except christmas 
each of the company s travel centers maintains a distinct  theme oriented atmosphere 
in addition to the southwestern merchandise it purchases from native american tribes  the company also imports some items from mexico  including handmade blankets  earthen pottery and wood items 
additional goods  novelties and imprinted merchandise are imported from several pacific rim countries 
the company has long standing relationships with many of its vendors and suppliers 
the company sells food under the dairy queen and dairy queen brazier brand names and sells snacks and souvenir merchandise under the stuckey s brand name 
the terms of its agreements with stuckey s and dairy queen obligate the company to pay these franchisers a franchise royalty and in some instances a promotion fee  each equal to a percentage of gross sales revenues from products sold  as well as comply with certain provisions governing the operation of the franchised stores 
the company continuously monitors and upgrades its travel center facilities to maintain a high level of comfort  quality and appearance 
improvements include new awnings and facings  new signage and enhanced lighting and furnishings 
outdoor advertising operations 
the outdoor advertising operations of the company include leasing of sites  construction of display structures  sales of advertising space  and production and design of display faces 
the company s leasing department has the responsibility for coordinating land leases with owners for the right to construct and maintain billboard structures on the landowner s property 
the leasing department also monitors the company s compliance with all government regulations regarding lease rights  construction and sales of outdoor structures 
the company s construction division erects billboard structures on sites acquired by the company without a pre existing structure  with the goal of maximizing the amount of leaseable area on a particular site 
the company s sales department  through its account representatives  sells advertising space to the company s clients from its inventory of approximately  display faces 
the account representatives work with the company s clients  their advertising agencies  and the company s production department to provide clients with high quality design and artwork for their billboards 
although the company s consistent expansion of its outdoor advertising inventory results in an advertising occupancy rate of less than  the company generally has approximately of its inventory under advertising agreements at any time 
the company s production staff performs a full range of activities required to create and install outdoor advertising 
production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout  painting the design or coordinating its printing  and installing the design displays 
billboards have historically been composed of several painted plywood sheets  but recently vinyl facing has replaced plywood in the majority of advertising produced 
the increased use of vinyl and pre printed advertising copy furnished to the company by the advertiser or its agency results in less labor intensive production work 
the company believes that this trend may reduce future operating expenses associated with the company s production activities 
competition travel services competition 
the company faces competition at its travel centers from quick service and full service restaurants  convenience stores  gift shops and  to some extent  from truck stops located along interstate highways in arizona and new mexico 
some of the travel centers that the company competes with are operated by large petroleum companies  while many others are small independently owned operations that do not offer brand name food service or gasoline 
giant industries  inc  a refiner and marketer of petroleum products  operates two travel centers  one in arizona and one in new mexico  which are high volume diesel fueling and large truck repair facilities that also include small shopping malls  full service restaurants  convenience stores  fast food restaurants and gift shops 
the company s principal competition from truck stops includes love s country stores  inc  petro corporation and flying j 
many convenience stores are operated by large  national chains that are substantially larger  better capitalized and have greater name recognition and access to greater resources than the company 
although the company faces substantial competition  the company believes that few of its competitors offer the same breadth of products and services dedicated to the traveling public 
outdoor advertising competition 
the company competes in all of its markets with other outdoor advertisers as well as other media  including broadcast and cable television  radio  newspaper  and direct mail marketers 
the company has little competition in its rural markets from other outdoor advertisers  but encounters direct competition in its smaller metropolitan markets from larger outdoor media companies  including outdoor systems  chancellor media corporation and donrey outdoor advertising  each of which have large national networks and greater resources than the company 
the company believes that by concentrating on interstate and tourist oriented advertising in markets other than the largest designated market areas it will be able to compete more effectively 
as the company expands geographically  however  it may encounter increased competition from other outdoor advertising firms  some of whom are substantially larger and have greater name recognition and access to substantially greater resources than the company 
employees as of january   the company had approximately full time and part time employees  were located in arizona  were located in new mexico and were located in texas 
none of the company s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the company believes that relations with its employees are good 
regulation travel centers 
each of the company s food service operations is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities relating to health  safety  cleanliness  and food handling 
the company s food service operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime  tip credits  and minimum wages 
the company believes that operations at its fourteen travel centers comply in all material respects with applicable licensing and regulatory requirements  however  future changes in existing regulations or the adoption of additional regulations could result in material increases in the company s costs 
historically  the company has incurred ongoing costs to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  primarily relating to underground storage tanks 
these costs include assessment  compliance  and remediation costs  as well as certain ongoing capital expenditures relating to the company s gasoline dispensing operations 
under recently enacted federal regulations  the company was obligated to upgrade or replace all non complying underground storage tanks it owns or operates to meet corrosion protection and overfill spill containment standards by december  in response to such programs  the company has  wherever possible  adopted a policy of replacing its underground storage tanks with above ground storage tanks to minimize the costs associated with leak detection and compliance with other regulatory programs 
non complying tanks have been upgraded or replaced at all of the company s travel centers 
the company s travel center operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the sale of alcohol and tobacco  and fireworks in its new mexico travel centers 
such regulations include certain mandatory licensing procedures and ongoing compliance measures  as well as special sales tax measures 
these regulations are subject to change and future modifications may result in decreased revenues or profit margins at the company s travel centers as a result of such changes 
outdoor advertising 
the outdoor advertising industry is subject to governmental regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
federal law  principally the highway beautification act of  as amended the beautification act  encourages states  by the threat of withholding federal appropriations for the construction and improvement of highways within such states  to implement legislation to regulate billboards located within feet of  or visible from  interstate and primary highways except in commercial or industrial areas 
all of the states have implemented regulations at least as restrictive as the beautification act  including some prohibition on the construction of new billboards adjacent to federally aided highways 
the beautification act  and the various state statutes implementing it  requires the payment of just compensation whenever governmental authorities require legally erected and maintained billboards to be removed from federally aided highways 
the states and local jurisdictions have  in some cases  passed additional and more restrictive regulations on the construction  repair  upgrading  height  size  and location of  and  in some instances  content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures adjacent to federally aided highways and other thoroughfares 
such regulations  often in the form of municipal building  sign or zoning ordinances  specify minimum standards for the height  size and location of billboards 
in some cases  the construction of new billboards or relocation of existing billboards is prohibited 
some jurisdictions also have restricted the ability to enlarge or upgrade existing billboards  such as converting from wood to steel or from non illuminated to illuminated structures 
from time to time governmental authorities order the removal of billboards by the exercise of eminent domain 
thus far  the company has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for any of its structures removed at the direction of governmental authorities  although there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so in the future 
in recent years  there have been movements to restrict billboard advertising of tobacco products 
it is likely that additional legislation of this type will be enacted on the national or on a local level in the company s markets 
revenues from tobacco advertisers accounted for less than of the company s total advertising revenues in fiscal amortization of billboards has also been adopted in varying forms in certain jurisdictions 
amortization permits the billboard owner to operate its billboard as a non conforming use for a specified period of time until it has recouped its investment  after which it must remove or otherwise conform its billboard to the applicable regulations without any compensation 
amortization and other regulations requiring the removal of billboards without compensation have been subject to vigorous litigation in state and federal courts and cases have reached differing conclusions as to the constitutionality of these regulations 
to date  amortization and other regulations in the company s markets have not materially adversely affected its operations 
trademarks the company operates its travel centers under a number of its own trademarks  as well as certain trademarks owned by third parties and licensed to the company  such as the dairy queen  dairy queen brazier  stuckey s  citgo and exxon trademarks 
the company believes that its trademark rights will not materially limit competition with its travel centers 
the company also believes that none of the trademarks it owns is material to the company s overall business  however  the loss of one or more of the company s licensed trademarks could have an adverse effect on the company

as of january   the company was indebted to various banks and individuals in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million under various loans and promissory notes 
land  buildings  equipment  billboards and inventories of the company secure many of the loans and promissory notes 
the loans and promissory notes mature at dates from march  to october  and accrue interest at rates ranging from to per annum 
on november   the company entered into a million credit agreement with one of its existing lenders 
at january   borrowing against this credit agreement was approximately million 
the company made capital expenditures of approximately million and million during the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended  these expenditures were made primarily for the construction of a new travel center  upgrades to existing travel centers  and for the construction and acquisition of additional billboard structures 
for the fiscal year ended  these expenditures were primarily for upgrades to the company s travel centers  including the new warehouse facility  and for the construction and acquisition of additional billboard structures 
during the next twelve months  the company anticipates incurring capital expenditures of approximately  related to travel center operation including approximately  for upgrades and improvements to existing facilities 
with regard to outdoor advertising operations  the company has plans to build approximately new billboard faces during the fiscal year ending january   at a cost of approximately million 
as of january   approximately million of the company s total indebtedness accrued interest at variable rates tied to the respective bank s prime lending rate 
as such  the company is subject to fluctuations in interest rates that could have a negative impact on the net income of the company 
in addition  it is likely that future indebtedness incurred by the company will be at variable rates which could impact the company s ability to consummate significant acquisitions in the future 
impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations which could result in disruptions in the operations of the company and its suppliers and customers 
state of readiness 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify those portions that could be affected by the year issue 
the evaluation revealed that the company s network hardware and operating system  voice mail system  e mail system  and accounting software are the major resources that do have year compliance issues 
fortunately  the identified systems are off the shelf products with year compliant versions now available 
the company has not yet completed its survey of its significant suppliers  vendors  and pertinent institutions to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their year issues 
the company will complete its survey by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s business relies will be timely converted or that failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
costs to address year issues 
the company estimates over the next twelve months that the costs associated with the implementation plan will not exceed  risks associated with year issues 
the company s failure to resolve year issues on or before december  could result in system miscalculations causing disruption in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  determine payments due  send and or receive e mail  or engage in similar normal business activities 
additionally  failure of third parties upon whom the company s business relies to timely remediate their year issues could result in disruptions in the company s supply of parts and materials  late  missed  or unapplied payments  temporary disruptions in order processing  and other general problems related to the company s daily operations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
until the company receives responses from significant suppliers  vendors  and pertinent institutions  the overall risks associated with the year issue remain difficult to accurately describe and quantify  and there can be no guarantee that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
contingency plan 
the company has not determined the specific risks that may need to be addressed by a contingency plan 
therefore  the company has not  to date  implemented a year contingency plan 
it is the company s goal to have its internal major year issues resolved and external effects determined by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the company will develop and implement a contingency plan by the end the third quarter of fiscal year  in the event the company s year project should fall behind schedule 
risk factors the company does not provide forecasts of potential future financial performance 
while the company s management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook 
no assurance of successful expansion 
the company intends to open new travel centers  expand its outdoor advertising operations  and implement gasoline wholesaling activities 
although the company s existing operations are based primarily in the southwest  the company s current expansion plans include consideration of acquisition opportunities in both the southwest and other geographic regions of the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions can be identified  and the company is likely to face competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities 
any such acquisition would be subject to negotiation of definitive agreements  appropriate financing arrangements  and performance of due diligence 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete such acquisitions  obtain acceptable financing  or any required consent of its bank lenders  or that such acquisitions that are completed can be integrated successfully into the company s existing operations 
the success of the company s expansion program will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of sufficient capital  the identification of appropriate expansion opportunities  the company s ability to attract  train  and retain qualified employees and management  and the continuing profitability of existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that any expansion will be profitable 
see business growth strategy 
need for additional financing 
in order to successfully implement the company s growth strategy  the company may need to seek additional financing from external sources 
the company has been able to secure financing for the acquisition of additional assets from commercial lenders in amounts up to of the fair market value of the acquired assets 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available in the future  or that if available  it will be on terms acceptable to the company 
the company anticipates that any financing which it does secure may impose certain financial and other restrictive covenants upon the company and its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate any acquired companies or assets into its existing operations  which could increase the company s operating expenses in the short term and materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
any acquisition by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity or debt securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as the diversion of the attention of the company s management from other business concerns  the entrance of the company into markets in which it has had no or only limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on third party relationships 
the company is dependent on a number of third party relationships under which it offers brand name and other products at its travel centers 
these brand name relationships include the company s distributorship relationships with citgo and exxon and its existing franchise agreements with dairy queen brazier and stuckey s 
the company s existing operations and plans for future growth anticipate the continued existence of such relationships 
there can be no assurance that the agreements that govern these relationships will not be terminated 
several of these agreements contain provisions that prohibit the company from offering additional products or services that are competitive to those of its suppliers 
although the company does not currently anticipate having to forego a significant business opportunity in order to comply with such agreements  there can be no assurance that adherence to existing agreements will not prevent the company from pursuing opportunities that management would otherwise deem advisable 
the company also relies upon several at will relationships with various third parties for much of its souvenir and gift merchandise 
although the company believes it has good relationships with its suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain relationships with suppliers of suitable merchandise at appropriate prices and in sufficient quantities

possible adverse impact of competition 
the company s travel centers face competition from major and independent oil companies  independent service station operators  national and independent operators of restaurants  diners and other eating establishments  and national and independent operators of convenience stores and other retail outlets 
in its outdoor advertising operations  the company faces competition for advertising revenues from other outdoor advertising companies  as well as from other media such as radio  television  print media and direct mail marketing 
the company also competes with a wide variety of other out of home advertising media  the range and diversity of which has increased substantially over the past several years  including advertising displays in shopping centers and malls  airports  stadiums  movie theaters and supermarkets 
some of the company s competitors  including major oil companies and convenience store operators  are substantially larger  better capitalized  and have greater name recognition and access to greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s travel centers and outdoor advertising operations will be able to compete successfully in their respective markets in the future

seasonality and other factors  quarterly fluctuations 
the travel center portion of the company s business is somewhat seasonal  and revenues may be affected by many factors  including weather  holidays and the price of alternative travel modes 
the company s revenues and earnings may experience substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
potential adverse effects of government regulation of travel centers 
each of the company s food service operations is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities  including regulations relating to health  safety  cleanliness and food handling  as well as federal and state laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime  tip credits and minimum wages 
the company s travel center operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the sale of tobacco and fireworks in its new mexico travel centers 
such regulations include certain mandatory licensing procedures and the ongoing compliance measures  as well as special sales tax measures 
the company believes that operations at fourteen travel centers comply with all applicable licensing and regulatory requirements 
any failure to comply with applicable regulations  or the adoption of additional regulations or changes in existing regulations could impose additional compliance costs on the company  require a cessation of certain activities or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business regulation 
environmental risks 
the company is subject to federal  state and municipal laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  and disposal of its petroleum products 
specifically  the federal government has issued more stringent regulations governing the storage of petroleum products with which the company was required to comply by december although the company believes that its activities comply with the current standards prescribed by law and the company has already completed certain renovations of its facilities to satisfy the federal government s enacted regulations  the risk of accidental contamination to the environment or injury can not be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the available resources of the company 
the company could be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future 
see business regulation 
potential adverse effects of government regulation of outdoor advertising 
outdoor advertising displays are subject to regulation by federal  state  and local governmental agencies 
these regulations  in some cases  limit the height  size  and location of billboards and  in limited circumstances  regulate the content of the advertising copy displayed on the billboards  particularly with respect to tobacco advertising 
some governmental regulations prohibit the construction of new billboards or the replacement  relocation  enlargement  or upgrading of existing structures 
some cities have adopted amortization ordinances under which  after the expiration of a specified period of time  billboards must be removed at the owner s expense and without the payment of compensation 
due to the location of its billboard structures outside smaller metropolitan and rural areas  the company has not been materially affected by such ordinances to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s billboard structures will not become subject to similar ordinances in the future 
ordinances requiring the removal of a billboard without compensation  whether through amortization or otherwise  are being challenged in various state and federal courts with conflicting results 
although  to date  the company has been adequately compensated for any of its structures removed at the direction of governmental authorities  future changes in such regulations as well as others applicable to the company s outdoor advertising operations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business regulation 
other uncertainties other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties are discussed in this form k in specific context and the company is subject to the financial or legal risks or uncertainties discussed in other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  the company is  of course  also subject to general economic risks  and other risks and uncertainties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed to are interest rates on the company s debt 
the company s interest sensitive liabilities are its debt instruments 
variable interest on short term debt equals libor plus the applicable margin 
long term debt bears interest at variable rates based primarily on the prime rate 
because the prime rate or libor may increase or decrease at any time  the company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in these base rates may have on the interest rate applicable to borrowings 
increases decreases in the interest rates applicable to borrowings would result in increased decreased interest expense and a reduction increase in the company s net income and after tax cash flow 
management does not  however  believe that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of its debt is likely to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
