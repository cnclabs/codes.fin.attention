item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company s historical results of operations have been materially affected by the substantial increase in the company s size as a result of the presidio acquisition december  and the knpc acquisition january  
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company included elsewhere herein 
revenues during  revenues from gas and oil production decreased to million as compared to million in such decrease in gas and oil revenues was the result of a decrease in i average gas prices received by the company from per mcf to per mcf which decreased revenues by approximately million  ii average oil prices received from per barrel to per barrel which decreased revenues by approximately million and  iii oil sales volumes of which decreased revenues by approximately million 
gas sales volumes increased to bcf which increased revenues by approximately million 
the increase in gas production levels was primarily due to the genesis acquisition and successful drilling results primarily in the wind river basin of wyoming 
during  revenues from gas and oil production increased to million  as compared to million in such increase in gas and oil revenues was the result of an increase in i average gas prices received by the company from per mcf to per mcf which increased revenues by approximately million  ii gas sales volumes of which increased revenues by approximately million  and iii oil sales volumes of which increased revenues by approximately million 
a decrease in the average oil prices from to reduced the revenues by approximately the increase in gas and oil volumes was primarily due to the presidio acquisition and development drilling

no gain or loss was recorded for the sale 
the company had no significant property sales during or marketing  gathering and processing revenues increased in as compared to and in as compared to such increase is due primarily to the acquisition of interenergy and higher volumes of gas marketed due to the company s increased production and marketing of additional third party gas 
costs and expenses expenses related to gas and oil production  production taxes  and depreciation  depletion and amortization have increased in each of the last two years due to increased production and revenue levels resulting from successful drilling operations as well as the genesis and presidio acquisitions 
on an mcfe basis  the company s costs decreased during the past year 
costs of gas and oil production was 
per mcfe in  as compared to 
per mcfe and 
per mcfe in and  respectively 
taxes on gas and oil production  which are generally calculated as a percentage of gas and oil sales  increased to in as compared to of gas and oil sales during and such increase from to was due to the increase of natural gas and oil produced in the wind river basin in where the company experiences additional production taxes as compared to its other areas of operation 
the company s depletion  depreciation and amortization rate increased on an mcfe basis to per mcfe for from 
per mcfe in and 
per mcfe in the increase was the result of lower oil reserve estimates at december  as a result of lower prices and higher cost reserve additions 
the company also recorded a charge in of million for the impairment of gas and oil properties 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of the company included elsewhere herein 
the cost of gas sold in connection with the company s marketing  gathering and processing operations has increased in each of the last two years  consistent with the increases in the associated revenues 
the gross profit decreased to a loss of 
million in as compared to income of million in and million in the decrease is attributable to lower gathering margins in and an increase in transportation costs relative to market differentials 
costs associated with exploration activities and impairments of leasehold costs increased to million in as compared to million in and million in the increase was the result of an aggressive exploratory drilling program during in which the company began to more fully explore for oil and gas on its large undeveloped acreage position 
general and administrative expenses increased in each of the last two years as a result of the company s significantly higher level of operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to 
per mcfe in as compared to 
and 
per mcfe in and  respectively 
the company added personnel during which was the primary reason for the increase 
in  the company reclassed certain general and administrative expenses that were primarily related to the exploration and land departments to exploration costs for the years ended  and the amounts were approximately million  million and million respectively 
interest expense decreased in as compared to as a result of a lower level of debt outstanding during interest expense increased in as compared to as a result of the debt incurred in connection with the presidio acquisition in december a large portion of the debt was repaid in october with the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of million shares of the company s common stock 
the company incurred a current tax liability in the amount of   and  in  and  respectively  as a result of the application of the alternate minimum tax rules as provided under the internal revenue code 
at december  the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million to offset potential taxable income 
the company s net deferred tax asset was million at december  a valuation allowance of approximately million at december  was provided against the company s net deferred tax assets based on management s estimate of the recoverability of future tax benefits 
the company evaluated all appropriate factors to determine the proper valuation allowance for carryforwards  including any limitations concerning their use  the year the carryforwards expire  the levels of taxable income necessary for utilization  and tax planning strategies 
in this regard  full valuation allowances were provided for investment tax credit carryforwards and option plan compensation 
based on its recent operating results and its expected levels of future earnings  the company believes it will  more likely than not  generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances were not provided 
capital resources and liquidity growth and acquisitions the company continues to pursue opportunities which will add value by increasing its reserve base and presence in significant natural gas areas  and further developing the company s ability to control and market the production of natural gas 
as the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities  it will benefit from its financing flexibility and the leverage potential of the company s overall capital structure 
capital and exploration expenditures the company s capital and exploration expenditures and sources of financing for the years ended december   and are as follows in millions capital and exploration expenditures acquisitions presidio knpc genesis interenergy williams field services sauer drilling company exploration costs development costs acreage gas gathering and processing 
other financing sources common stock issue preferred stock issue net long term bank debt advances from gas purchasers proceeds from sale of assets 
cash flow from operations before changes in working capital working capital and other of the million noted for  million shares of the company s common stock were not issued due to the company s ownership of million principal amount of presidio senior gas indexed notes the gins 
the gins were purchased in june for approximately million financed primarily through a stock offering in the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in  million being allocated to exploration and development drilling 
the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary and there are no material long term commitments associated with the company s capital expenditure plans 
consequently  the company is able to adjust the level of its capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures by the company will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
historically  the company has funded capital expenditures and working capital requirements with both internally generated cash  borrowings and stock transactions 
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to the receipt of million from gas purchasers as advances 
these advances were for future natural gas deliveries of  mmbtu per day over a twelve month period commencing january net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to increases in gas prices received and higher gas production 
advance from gas purchasers the company sold mmcfpd of gas for delivery  but was paid million for the gas in the fourth quarter of as described in note of the financial statements 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank debt 
as the gas is produced and delivered in without a corresponding payment received  bank debt will increase more than would otherwise occur 
during  the advance payment for gas included in current liabilities will be reduced and bank debt increased due to the advanced sale transaction 
bank credit facility the company s credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit with a current borrowing base of million 
the amount of the borrowing base may be redetermined as of december and june of each calendar year at the sole discretion of the lender 
a redetermination as of december  has not yet been made 
at december   the aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facility was million  bearing interest at per annum 
the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility at december  was million 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants which require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth as well as certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility  except for the minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant for which the company is required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of million 
as a result of the non cash charge of million for the impairment of gas and oil properties  the consolidated tangible net worth at december  was approximately million 
on march   the company obtained a waiver of the net worth covenant as of december  and amended the credit facility to reduce the minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant to million 
borrowings under the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the agent bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus or ii the agent bank s eurodollar rate  plus a margin ranging from to

public offering in october  the company sold  shares of its common stock in a public offering 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million which were used to repay a majority of the company s outstanding debt and to fund the acquisition of all of the assets of genesis 
markets and prices wildhorse  which was created to provide gathering  processing  marketing  storage and field services to rocky mountain gas and oil producers  will continue to pursue the construction or acquisition of gathering  processing and storage areas of the rocky mountain region 
during  the company s share of wildhorse s investments approximated million for gas gathering and processing assets 
the company percent and kne percent jointly own wildhorse 
the company has dedicated significant amounts of its rocky mountain gas production to wildhorse for gathering  processing and marketing 
kne contributed gas marketing contracts and storage assets in western colorado 
the company s revenues and associated cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in gas and oil prices 
all of the company s gas and oil production is currently market sensitive as no amounts of the company s future gas and oil production have been sold at contractually specified prices except for the advance from gas purchasers previously described 
during  the average prices received for gas and oil by the company were per mcf and per barrel  respectively  as compared to mcf and per barrel in and per mcf and per barrel in year year issue 
many computer software systems were structured to use a two digit date field meaning that they will not be able to properly recognize dates in the year as a result  computer systems and software may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance as systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
compliance program 
in order to address the year issue  the company appointed the computer information systems department to assure that key automated systems and related processors would remain functional through year the department addressed the project by reviewing the information technology it and non information technology systems to determine whether they were year compliant 
also  the department prepared a formal questionnaire for all significant suppliers  customers  and service providers to determine the extent to which the company was vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate the year problem 
company state of readiness 
a review and assessment of the information technology and non information technology systems was completed as of december  and did not identify any material systems which are not year compliant 
in addition  the company has received written assurances of year compliance from approximately of its operators and purchasers and of its vendors 
the operators and purchasers who responded as being year compliant represent of the total dollar amount from that source to the company and the vendors who responded as being year compliant represent 
the third party confirmation process is still ongoing 
the company believes that any disruption caused from a third party s inability to be year compliant will not be material to its operations 
cost to address year compliance issues 
the company believes that it will not be required to make any material expenditures to address the year problem as it relates to its existing systems 
to date  costs incurred to address year compliance have been internal in nature and have been charged to income as incurred 
such costs have been funded from cash provided by operating activities 
however  uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with any year compliance  and the company intends to continue to make efforts to ensure that third parties with whom it has relationships are year compliant 
the computer information systems department is not aware of any it projects that have been delayed due to the year compliance program 
risk of non compliance and contingency plan 
the goal of the year project has been to ensure that all of the critical systems and processes which are under the direct control of the company remain functional 
however  because certain systems and processes may be interrelated with systems outside of the control of the company  there can be no assurance that all implementations will be successful 
the principal area of risk to the company is thought to be gas measurement control systems of pipeline volumes provided by third parties 
a likely worst case scenario is that despite the company s efforts  there could be failures of such systems which might cause disruption to the natural gas delivery process 
however  the company believes that the risk of such occurrence is low based upon its review and confirmation efforts concerning year compliance with third party pipe lines 
accordingly  as part of the year project  contingency plans will be developed to respond to any potential failures as they may be identified 
there can be no assurance that unexpected year compliance problems of either the company or its vendors  customers and service providers would not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
the company will continue throughout  to consider the likelihood of a material business interruption due to the year issue 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of  the company adopted sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income  which requires the display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
comprehensive income represents all non stockholder related changes in equity of an entity during the reporting period  including net non stockholder related income and charges directly to equity which are excluded from net income 
for the years ended december    and there are no material differences between the company s traditional and comprehensive net income 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which establishes standards for the way public enterprises are to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires the reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and cannot be applied retroactively 
sfas no 
must be applied to derivative instruments that were issued  acquired  or substantially modified after december  the company is evaluating sfas no 
and has not yet quantified the impact adopting the statement will have on its financial statements 
however  sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income stockholders equity should the company continue to enter into transactions covered by the pronouncement 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop provides guidance with respect to accounting for the various types of costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for the company s use 
the company is required to and will adopt sop by the first quarter of fiscal and believes that adoption will not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company utilizes various financial instruments which inherently have some degree of market risk 
the primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rate fluctuations 
price fluctuations the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production 
accordingly  in order to increase the financial flexibility and to protect the company against commodity price fluctuations  the company may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  enter into non speculative hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  forward sale contracts  commodity futures  options and other similar agreements relating to natural gas and crude oil 
in connection with an advance payment for future natural gas deliveries  the company entered into three gas price swap contracts with third parties under which the company became a fixed price payor for  mmbtu per day for a twelve month period commencing january at a weighted average price of per mmbtu 
at december   the estimated fair value of the open gas price swap contracts was an unrealized loss of million 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under the company s credit facility bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the agent bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus or ii the agent bank s eurodollar rate  plus a margin ranging from to 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
assuming no change in the amount outstanding during  the impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately  as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value
