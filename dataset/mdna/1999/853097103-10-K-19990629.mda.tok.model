item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ajax  at both its new jersey and mexican facilities  manufactures trailer chassis to customer order and remanufacturers existing chassis 
revenues are recognized when the finished product is inspected and accepted by the customer or its agent and title has transferred 
the market for chassis is cyclical and is affected by overall economic conditions  in particular the needs of the transportation industry 
remanufacturing existing chassis tends to be counter cyclical to the manufacturing of new chassis 
r s is engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of customized dump trucks and trailers  specialized truck suspension systems and related products and parts 
r s also acts as a distributor for truck equipment manufactured by other companies  including cranes  tarpaulins  spreaders  plows and specialized service bodies 
cps is primarily engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of dump trailers  specializing in trailers for hauling bulk commodities such as gravel  grain and corn  and for the construction and waste hauling industries 
the sales forces of r s and cps have begun to coordinate their activities and each now offers the products of the other 
the r s and cps product lines complement each other 
coordinating activities allows each sales force to market a more diverse product line and each of the product lines to be offered to a wider customer base 
part of the company s strategy is to grow through expansion of product lines and acquisitions such as the recently completed acquisitions of r s  cps and ranor  and the establishment of the mexican facility 
the company s continued expansion may place a strain on the company s management  operational  financial and other resources 
the company s expansion plans will depend on our ability to identify appropriate targets for acquisition and raise the necessary financing for acquisitions 
further  the success of the company s efforts will depend on its ability to market new products  absorb new management and other personnel  reduce duplicative overhead and manage geographically dispersed operations 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully expand our operations or manage our growth 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain components of the company s consolidated statements of income expressed in dollar amounts in thousands  and as a percentage of net revenues 
results of operations for the year ended march  and the period ended january   reflect only ajax s operations because standard had no operations during these periods 
for the year ended march  the company s results reflect the operations of the company for the entire year and those of ajax for the period from january to march  the year ended march  reflects the consolidated amounts of standard including ajax  and r s and cps from their respective dates of acquisition rounded

liquidity and capital resources the company generated  of cash in operating activities during fiscal as compared to  used in operating activities during fiscal the cash generated in operating activities during fiscal reflects primarily an increase in net income and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of  which was partially offset by an increase in inventory of  the net cash used in investing activities was  during fiscal as compared to  used in investing activities during the prior year 
the cash used in investing activities during fiscal was primarily for the acquisition of r s and cps  the retirement of certain indebtedness of r s  cps and the company and for the acquisition of other property  plant and equipment and additional capitalized acquisition costs 
the cash generated by financing activities was principally derived from the proceeds of the  july  term loan and revolving credit agreement between the company and certain of its subsidiaries acting as guarantors and pnc bank  national association pnc  both individually and as agent for other financial institutions credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided for a term loan in the amount of  and a revolving loan in the principal amount of  collectively  the loans 
the company made scheduled principal payments of  during fiscal  and reduced the initial term loan of  to  at march  the funds for the ranor acquisition were obtained by increasing from  to  the amounts outstanding under the company s credit agreement 
the company s credit agreement  as amended  provides for term loans in the principal amount of  and a revolving loan in the principal amount of  the principal of the term loans is payable in two tranches of  and  in june and june  respectively 
amounts outstanding under the revolving loan are payable in full in june  subject to the company s request  with the approval of the lenders  to extend the due date for one year  with a maximum extension of two one year periods 
all amounts due under the credit agreement are secured by a lien on all the company s assets 
the rate of interest for the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement is at march  the terms on which the company sells its products vary by subsidiary but generally provide for payment within days of acceptance 
the company s account s receivable was collected in an average of less than days 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal capital expenditures incurred during fiscal were primarily for the initial investment of  in a new plant in mexico to service the western part of the united states  the purchase and installation of a new computer network system and the refurbishing of the new corporate office facility 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending march  will substantially exceed those of the preceding years as the company expands its operations 
the company s capital expenditures relating to the mexican operation were less than  the annual dividend requirement on the preferred stock is  the future earnings of the company  if any  may not be adequate to pay the dividends on the preferred stock  and  although the company intends to pay quarterly dividends out of available capital surplus  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain sufficient capital surplus or that future earnings  if any  will be adequate to pay the dividends on the preferred stock 
in addition  at march   the company had  in total debt outstanding  consisting of  in notes payable to pnc  which currently bear interest at a variable rate based on libor which is payable quarterly and the balance to various other small creditors 
the company continues to seek opportunities for growth through acquisitions  and  in connection therewith  may seek to raise additional cash in the form of equity  bank debt or other debt financing  or may seek to issue stock as consideration for acquisition targets 
at march   the company had working capital of  which is sufficient to meet its current operating requirements  and  if necessary  such needs could be met out of the remaining cash on hand from the revolving loan facility 
subsequent events in june  pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement dated april  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of critical components corporation ccc 
in consideration for such capital stock the company issued to the shareholders of ccc  who are also shareholders of the company  an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company 
in addition  the shareholders of ccc will receive up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock if the company acquires any of a group of companies previously targeted for acquisition by ccc 
simultaneously with the acquisition of ccc  the company  through ccc  acquired substantially all of the assets of ranor  a fabricator of large precision assemblies for the aerospace  nuclear  industrial and military markets 
the consideration paid for ranor was  subject to final adjustment  of which  was paid in cash and  was paid in the form of convertible subordinated notes of the company 
funds to complete the ranor acquisition were obtained by increasing the amounts outstanding under the company s credit agreement as described above 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the company s first quarter ending june  financial statements will only reflect the activity of ranor for the period of june  through june  in connection with the acquisitions the company incurred approximately  in investment advisory and finder s fees  and legal and accounting expenses 
the company incurred approximately  in fees and expenses  including bank fees  in connection with the increase and amendment of the existing credit facility 
year compliance the company continues to address the impact of the year issue on its business 
the year issue is the result of computer hardware and software programs designed to use two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  certain computer applications may fail or create erroneous results at the year the company has performed a comprehensive review of its computer systems identifying those systems which could be adversely affected by the year issue 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing hardware and software and conversion to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as modified and converted 
the company replaced substantial portions of its computer hardware and software during fiscal  as it integrated the operations of ajax  r s  cps and the mexican facility 
the r s and cps facilities require additional modification and conversion of their computer systems 
management estimates that the cost of upgrading the r s and cps facilities will be approximately  it is anticipated that testing of all modifications and conversions will be complete by late summer this timing will allow management to assess and implement a contingency plan if required 
with our comprehensive assessment and modification and conversion protocol  management does not believe that the year issue will have a materially adverse affect on other company s operations 
however  if such protocol is not timely completed  the year issues may have a material impact on the company s operation 
in connection with the ranor acquisition  the company received certain representations and warranties from ranor s shareholders regarding its compliance with the year issue 
nevertheless  the company will undertake an analysis of ranor s susceptibility to the year issues 
because year issues may also impact our customers and suppliers  the company is in the process of obtaining information from key suppliers and customers on their compliance with year issues 
statement regarding forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the exchange act which represent the company s expectations or belief concerning future events that involve risks and uncertainties  including the demand for our products  the costs of supplies and raw materials 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report including  without limitation  the statements under management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in the annual report  are forward looking statements 
while the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowings under the credit agreement 
as of june  the company had approximately  million of libor based debt outstanding under the credit agreement 
a hypotethical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level corresponds to an increase in interest expense over a one year period of  this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
further  the company has entered into an interest rate hedge instrument to protect against interest rate increases
