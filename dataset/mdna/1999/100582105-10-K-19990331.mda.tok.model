item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations the company s total revenues increased from million in to million in the growth was primarily attributable to a increase in the company s principal business  prepaid wireless  and to a increase in teleservices revenues  primarily arising from increased customer service for carriers cc customers 
a decline in roaming service revenues slightly offset the growth in prepaid wireless and teleservices 
in  total revenues increased compared to primarily due to increases in prepaid wireless and systems revenues 
the company incurred operating losses for the years ended december  and totaling million and million  respectively  compared to operating income of  in excluding the effects of the loss on impairment of long lived assets  the operating losses for the years ended december  and would have been million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating losses reflects the increased depreciation  telecommunication and personnel costs associated with the deployment and operation of the c c network 
the specifics of each division s revenues and net operating income loss are discussed in greater detail below 
the company s reportable operating segments consist of prepaid wireless services  teleservices  roaming services and systems divisions 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note of the company s consolidated financial statements  except that the financial results for the company s operating segments have been prepared using a management approach 
this approach is consistent with the basis and manner in which the company s management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
the company evaluates performance based on stand alone divisions operating income loss before interest and taxes and allocates corporate level operating expenses to the operating divisions 
segment disclosure information is included in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s chief operating decision maker is its president 
the company s divisions  or operating segments  are managed separately because each represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves unique markets within the wireless industry 
however  the divisions do complement each other in order to provide the company with a strong suite of products and services to meet the needs of wireless carriers 
the company s customers include eight of the ten largest domestic wireless carriers  six of whom use two or more of the company s products

at the end of there were approximately  paid subscribers on the c c network  as compared to  subscribers at the end of  an increase of over 
gross margins for the prepaid wireless services division improved from a negative margin in to of revenues in and of prepaid wireless services revenues in the improvement in both years resulted from the significant increase in prepaid wireless services revenues in each of and this increase in gross margins was partially offset by increased personnel and related costs incurred to support the growth of the c c network 
operating losses for the prepaid wireless services division increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in these operating losses have been due to costs associated with the c c network  including costs for personnel and for telecommunications equipment and software 
while the company expects to continue to incur significant capital and personnel costs to support the expansion and development of the c c network  the company also anticipates that increases in prepaid wireless services revenues will improve the gross margins and operating results of the prepaid wireless services division in teleservices division teleservices division revenues increased from million in to million in and increased to million in the increases in teleservices revenues were primarily due to new and additional services provided to existing customers and the addition of new carrier customers in and a significant component of these increases was the increase in teleservices revenues from billing inquiry services provided to the prepaid division s carriers 
teleservices revenues from those services were negligible in  increased to million in and increased to million in gross margins for the teleservices division increased from of teleservices revenues in to of teleservices revenues in  but declined to of teleservices revenues in the increase from to resulted primarily from labor efficiencies and other economies of scale as higher teleservices revenues absorbed more fixed operating costs 
the decrease in gross margins in was primarily due to incremental costs in connection with opening three additional call centers in  including training and travel costs 
although the company anticipates teleservices revenues to increase in  it expects the gross margin from that division to decline compared to the levels achieved in a significant reason for the gross margin decline is increased costs resulting from the company s plan to support new business in the teleservices division by leasing call center facilities  equipment and personnel from third parties that will be classified entirely in cost of services 
in and prior years  a portion of these costs were classified in depreciation or general and administrative expenses 
operating income for the teleservices division decreased slightly from  in to  in and  in operating income for the teleservices division represented of teleservices revenues in  in and in the decreases in each of and were primarily due to the company s significant investment in call center technology during designed to enhance service offerings as well as improve operational efficiency 
roaming services division roaming services revenues remained relatively flat at million in and million in and decreased to million in roaming services revenues remained relatively constant from to  even though there were fewer suspensions of inter carrier automatic roaming agreements by the carriers in as compared to  because the company expanded the billing options that it offered to carriers and maintained its market presence 
the decrease in roaming services revenues in was primarily attributable to greater suspensions of inter carrier automatic roaming agreements and some cannibalization of unregistered roaming use by prepaid wireless growth 
in addition  a consumer decision to use the company s premium priced roaming service has been adversely affected by an increase in one rate registered roaming plans offered by some national carriers 
the company anticipates that these trends will continue and  therefore  roaming services revenues will continue to decrease over time 
gross margins for the roaming services division improved from of revenues in to in and in the improvement in both years resulted primarily from enhancement and expansion of automated features of the service that reduced labor costs 
operating income for the roaming services division was relatively flat at million in and million in and decreased to million in the decrease in was primarily a result of lower absorption of fixed costs as roaming services revenues declined 
the decrease was offset to some extent by reduced labor costs 
the company anticipates that operating income for the roaming services division will continue to decline slightly due to the anticipated decrease in roaming services revenues 
systems division systems revenues increased from million in to million in and increased to million in the increase in systems revenues was attributable to the sale of prepaid systems to an existing customer in mexico and to new customers in south america 
the increase in was due to further system sales to new and existing customers in south america 
gross margins for the systems division decreased slightly from of systems revenues in to in and further decreased to in the reduction in the gross margin from to was primarily due to a change in the mix of the types of systems sold to more sales of prepaid systems in proportion to total sales 
prepaid systems have a lower margin than voice systems 
the decrease in was primarily a result of increased competition in the market for such systems that resulted in reduced prices for the systems  as well as higher costs associated with installing systems abroad 
the trend of selling more prepaid systems in proportion to total systems sales also continued and  therefore  was an additional factor in the decrease in gross margin 
operating income for the systems division decreased from  in to  in and increased to  in operating income for the systems division represented of systems revenues in  of systems revenues in and of systems revenues in the decrease in operating income in resulted primarily from costs incurred to expand into mexico and south america  including costs for sales  development and administrative personnel  international travel expenses  additional development and test equipment and increased amortization costs related to goodwill acquired in connection with the purchase of a subsidiary 
operating income remained consistent as a percentage of systems revenues from to  notwithstanding the decrease in gross margin  because sales and marketing expenses of the systems division were reduced with the consolidation of one of the division s satellite sales offices into its tulsa headquarters 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems division customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk

engineering  research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease primarily resulted from engineers devoting less time to developing and building out the c c network infrastructure than they had in the prior year and  to a lesser extent  to the changes associated with organizing the company into its four operating divisions 
as a result of the divisional structure  certain senior management personnel changed their functional responsibilities from engineering to general management and oversight of the divisions 
the company intends to continue to increase its engineering  research and development expenditures to support future development and enhancements of its prepaid and other wireless services and systems 
engineering  research and development expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues from to in the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was principally due to costs  including recruiting fees and other personnel costs  associated with the company s hiring of new personnel to support ongoing development and enhancements  implementation and deployment of the c c network  and to a lesser extent  additional personnel and related costs to support the expansion of teleservices and system sales 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include direct sales and product management salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  in addition to the cost of trade shows  advertising and other promotional expenses 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in this decrease resulted primarily from revenues absorbing fixed sales and marketing costs that did not increase as rapidly as revenue growth 
in addition  the decrease resulted from the consolidation of the systems division satellite sales offices to the tulsa headquarters in and  to a lesser extent  to the changes associated with organizing the company into its four operating divisions 
as a result of the divisional structure  certain senior management personnel changed their functional responsibilities from sales and marketing to general management and oversight of the divisions 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues from to in and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was principally due to additional expenditures to support the concentrated efforts of the systems division to expand internationally and the overall growth in system sales 
additional personnel  recruiting  commissions and other costs were also incurred in to support sales and marketing efforts in the prepaid wireless services and teleservices divisions 
the company expects to increase expenditures for sales  marketing and product management in the future to assist carriers with more prepaid marketing and distribution efforts as well as expanding systems sales into new geographical markets 
such expenditures are expected to vary as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees and other expenses that provide administrative support to the company 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in the increase resulted principally from the addition of staff to support the company s growth and changes associated with organizing of the company into its four operating divisions 
as a result of the divisional structure  certain senior management personnel changed their functional responsibilities from marketing and engineering to general management and oversight of the divisions 
total general and administrative expenses were consistent as a percentage of total revenues for and  respectively  but increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in in the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to additional employees and related recruiting expenses to support the company s growth  along with a full year of costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
goodwill related to acquisitions is amortized over eight years 
depreciation and amortization expense increased more than in compared to and from to the increase in was due primarily to the depreciation of additional technical equipment and software to support the rapid expansion and enhancement of the company s prepaid wireless network 
these same factors contributed to greater depreciation and amortization in compared to in addition  the increase in was attributable to the amortization of goodwill from the company s acquisitions and depreciation of technical equipment and software purchased for the teleservices business 
depreciation and amortization expense are expected to increase in due to increased capital expenditures for telecommunications systems  primarily related to new features and functionality and the continued expansion of the c c network 
impairment of long lived assets the company recognized a pre tax charge of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  for a write down of assets that are no longer being used to support the company s operations 
interest income interest income increased from  in the year ended december  to million in and million in interest income was earned from investments of the proceeds of the company s public offerings and was offset slightly by interest expense from the company s capital leases 
provision benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  yielded a income tax benefit 
the income tax expense of  for the year ended december  yielded a income tax rate  as compared to the statutory rate of 
the lack of an income tax benefit in  the lower benefit in and the higher rate in resulted primarily from the non deductibility of goodwill from the company s acquisitions 
in addition  the company did not provide any additional benefit for net operating losses generated in the company s effective income tax rate may be greater than in future years due to the continued impact of non deductible goodwill 
the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences based on management s assessment that it is more likely than not that future results of operations will be sufficient to realize this asset

the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  changes in regulations affecting the wireless industry  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the company s roaming services revenues are affected by the frequency and volume of use of the company s services  which may be influenced by seasonal trends  as well as changes in demand during particular periods due to a higher or lower incidence of temporary suspension of inter carrier roaming agreements in certain markets 
teleservices revenues may be influenced by the requirements of one of more of the company s significant teleservices customers  including engagement of the company to implement or assist in implementing special projects of limited duration 
the timing of orders and the number of large prepaid systems shipped during a particular quarter may fluctuate based upon the needs of prepaid systems customers and can have a significant impact on the level of systems division revenues 
because a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are committed in advance  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  unexpected revenue shortfalls could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of likely future performance 
during  the company made significant investments in personnel and infrastructure to support the ongoing development  expansion and upgrading of the c c network 
these strategic investments have impacted earnings and the company expects that these strategic investments will continue to impact earnings in the short term 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to additional capital expenditures to support expanded features and growth of the company s c c network 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily generated from million in depreciation and amortization expense  which resulted from the significant investment in telecommunications systems and equipment in depreciation and amortization was offset mostly by increased accounts receivable and inventory balances due to the increased sales volume in the company s investing activities utilized million of net cash in the company expended million in  including almost million for telecommunications systems equipment and software for expansion of the company s c c network 
these expenditures were offset by million in net sales of short term investments 
the company anticipates that over the next months it will continue to make significant capital investments for additional equipment and enhanced feature capabilities to strengthen prepaid wireless services 
the company s financing activities utilized  in  mainly due to payments of capital lease obligations  offset by proceeds from exercise of stock options 
in addition  the company repurchased  shares for  in accordance with a plan approved by the board of directors 
these shares are being held by the company as treasury shares 
the company believes that its short term investments and the funds anticipated to be generated from operations would be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next months 
year the company is currently implementing enterprise wide project and test plans to ensure that all products  services and support systems can fully process date time data before  during  and after midnight  december   recognize the year as a leap year and maintain existing interoperability and interfaces with other devices already in use without any modifications or changes in operations 
the company is assessing its readiness by conducting comprehensive inventories of all hardware  software  telecommunications providers  and material third party relationships 
this stage is nearly complete and the process will continue to be updated during seeking compliance certification from each vendor through direct communication 
the company is conducting unit  regression  interoperability  and call flow tests wherever possible 
dedicated resources  including senior level management and paid consultants  manage this comprehensive effort 
implementing test plans that are supported by doctorate level technical consultants and dedicated qa equipment and personnel that are examining multiple static and rollover date scenarios 
testing is projected to be completed by june  the assessment process follows a method to focus on vendors products that are most significant to the company s operations with the intent to maximize the lead time should any issues arise 
for any systems that may need replacement  the company will take the necessary steps to obtain  test and install qualified systems to ensure timely year compliance 
in june  the company completed the re write  redesign and implementation of its c c prepaid system 
the company s development team devoted nearly one year to produce the necessary changes and included year readiness as part of this process 
additionally  desktop hardware and software  call distribution systems and customer service handling software are year ready today 
to ensure year readiness  the company intends to upgrade these systems through vendor provided year patches or purchases of new systems in the normal course of business during core business teams for all divisions expect to examine all internal and external support systems including facilities  finance and human resource components 
the company has completed a comprehensive on site physical inventory and upgrade of all of its c c nodes  of which year readiness was a component 
the remedial action required as a result of this inventory is minimal and expected to be implemented by september  in addition  bcgi has identified unix servers that require upgrades to be ready for year all necessary software has been obtained and the project is expected to be completed by june  the company licenses some of the software used to support the company s services from only one source and these sources are small corporations 
the company is testing the software of such sources and expects to receive updates from these sources to achieve year readiness 
in the event that any of these sources are not ready by june   the company will establish contingency plans to ensure there will be no adverse impact on operations 
the company has licensed the source code from one such vendor to aid the company in year readiness testing efforts for the roamerplus service 
in march the company s systems division completed testing of its prepaid platform in use in several international markets and found that it was year ready with no failures 
the company is fully dependent on the services of multiple telecommunications providers 
if these providers fail to deliver these services  the company would be vulnerable to serious service failures and be exposed to liability to customers and third parties  including the potential for significant lost revenue 
the company is communicating with all providers in order to assess this risk 
additionally  the company will evaluate contingency options in the event of a failure by such providers 
the company has not currently developed any contingency plans for the services of these providers 
in the event that tests reveal failures that cannot be remedied within the company s timetable for readiness  contingency plans will be established 
the company has spent significant amounts in research and development of its c c prepaid service system to ensure it is year ready 
in addition  through december  the company has incurred and expensed approximately  in payroll  benefit and consulting costs for dedicated resources related to year issues 
the company currently estimates additional costs of approximately  will be incurred in to resolve year issues 
the company anticipates that the amounts and resources utilized to achieve year readiness will not delay or reduce the resources available to complete other projects 
the costs to complete year analysis and remediation are based on management s best estimates  which have been determined through numerous assumptions about future events including the availability of resources and other factors 
however  there can be no assurances that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that could generate significant negative consequences include undetected errors or defects of third party hardware and software utilized in the company s operations  noncompliance of other providers phone service  electricity  other utilities  etc 
and other uncertainties 
although management does not expect year issues to have a material impact on its business or results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruptions or other limitations of system functionality 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including without limitation  statements regarding improvement of prepaid division gross margin and operating results  teleservices revenue and gross margin  trend of decreased suspensions of inter carrier automatic roaming agreements  prepaid cannibalization of unregistered roaming and carrier marketing of one rate registered roaming plans to reduce roaming service revenues  roaming division profitability declining due to decreasing revenue  increased expenditures for engineering  research and development  increased expenditures for sales  marketing and product management  greater costs of depreciation and amortization and an effective income tax rate greater than 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
a number of important factors exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  technological changes in the company s industry  the ability of the company to continue to successfully support its c c network  the ability of the company s carrier customers to successfully continue to market and sell c c prepaid wireless services  the company s ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  increased competition and general economic factors 
historically  a significant portion of the company s revenues in any particular period have been attributable to a limited number of customers 
this concentration of customers can cause the company s revenues and earnings to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the volume of call traffic generated through these customers  the services being performed for the teleservices programs and the level of system sales 
a significant decrease in business from any of the company s major customers  including a decrease in business due to factors outside of the company s control  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of the company s prepaid  teleservices and systems division contracts have been extended beyond their expiration dates or will expire in and beyond 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in renewing any of these contracts 
if these contracts are not renewed the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify 
the company experienced an operating loss in and the first three quarters of  primarily due to expenses associated with the development and expansion of its cc network 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  variations in the level of system sales  changes in regulations affecting the wireless industry  changes in the company s operating expenses  the ability to identify  hire and retain qualified personnel and general economic conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s results of operations will be below prior results or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
the company historically has provided its services almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
although the wireless telecommunications market has experienced significant growth in recent years  there can be no assurance that such growth will continue at similar rates  or at all  or that wireless carriers will continue to use the company s services 
the company expects that demand for its roaming services will continue to decline as fewer inter carrier roaming agreements are suspended  prepaid cannibalization of unregistered roaming use increases and carriers more frequently offer one rate roaming plans 
in addition  prepaid wireless and pcs services are relatively new services in new markets  and if these markets do not grow as expected or if the carriers in these markets do not use the company s services  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s future success depends  in large part  on the continued use of its existing services and systems  the acceptance of new services in the wireless industry and the company s ability to develop new services and systems or adapt existing services or systems to keep pace with changes in the wireless telephone industry 
further  a rapid shift away from the use of wireless in favor of other services  could affect demand for the company s service offerings and could require the company to develop modified or alternative service offerings to address the particular needs of the providers of such new services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or marketing its existing or future service offerings or systems in a timely manner  or at all 
the company is currently devoting significant resources toward the support and enhancement of its prepaid wireless services and systems to maintain system reliability and expand the c c network 
several of the company s carrier customer contracts contain penalty clauses that provide for reductions in revenue for certain network outages 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully support and enhance the c c network effectively to avoid system outages and any associated loss in revenue  that the market for the company s prepaid service will continue to develop  or that the company s c c network will successfully support current and future growth 
furthermore  the company has expended significant amounts of capital to support the c c agreements it has secured with its carrier customers 
because c c revenues are principally generated by prepaid subscriber minutes of use  the company s c c revenues can be impacted by the carrier s ability to successfully market and sell prepaid services 
in addition  teleservices revenues associated with billing inquiry support for c c carrier customers are becoming a more significant portion of teleservices revenues and therefore these revenues are dependent upon the size and growth of the c c subscriber base 
the company has expanded its operations rapidly  creating significant demands on the company s administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
in addition  the growth of the company s teleservices division is dependent on recruiting  training and retaining employees to perform customer services responsibilities 
teleservices has also recently outsourced a small portion of its call center operations to a third party vendor who is responsible for certain operational functions  including hiring  training and retaining employees 
there can be no assurance that the vendor will continue to be able to meet the company s existing and future needs effectively 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of the company s operations 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s services  its ability to retain key personnel and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems division customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
the market for services to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
a number of companies currently offer one or more of the services offered by the company 
in addition  many wireless carriers are providing or can provide  in house  the services that the company offers 
in addition  the company anticipates continued growth and competition in the wireless carrier services industry and consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology 
if unauthorized copying or misuse of the company s technology were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  some of the software used to support the company s services is licensed by the company from single vendors  which are small corporations 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to license this software to the company or  if any supplier terminates its agreement with the company  that the company will be able to develop or otherwise procure software from another supplier on a timely basis and at commercially acceptable prices 
the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer  switching and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
any damage  failure or delay that causes interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is actively addressing the concerns of its operations with respect to year issues 
company management  with the assistance of consultants  is implementing an enterprise wide project to identify systems  equipment  vendors and customers that may be affected by the year issues and to develop a comprehensive plan to be in compliance with the year issues prior december  the company expects to make the necessary changes to be year compliant  but there can be no assurances that the company will adequately identify all year issues and the associated costs and expenses in a timely manner 
also  there can be no assurance that such costs and expenses will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems division customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
the company does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item
