see item a market risk overview mdsi develops  markets  implements and supports mobile workforce management and wireless connectivity software and related network and mobile computing equipment for use by a wide variety of companies that have substantial mobile workforces  such as utilities  telecommunications companies  taxi service providers  courier companies and roadside recovery organizations 
mdsi s products are used by such companies in conjunction with public and private wireless data communications networks to provide comprehensive solutions for the automation of business processes associated with the scheduling  dispatching and management of a mobile workforce 
the company s products provide a cost effective method for companies with mobile workers to utilize data communications to communicate with such workers  and for such workers to interface on a real time basis with their corporate information systems 
the company s revenue is derived from i software and services  consisting of the licensing of software and provision of related services  including project management  installation  integration  customization and training  ii third party products and services  consisting of the provision of non mdsi products and services as part of the total contract  terminal and infrastructure equipment consisting of the sale of mobile computing devices  related in vehicle equipment and wireless data network equipment manufactured by the company  iii terminal and infrastructure equipment consisting of the sale of mobile computing devices  related in vehicle equipment and wireless data network equipment manufactured by the company  and iv maintenance and support  consisting of the provision of after sale support services as well as hourly  annual or extended maintenance contracts 
the implementation of a complete mobile data solution requires a wireless data communications network  a land based data communications network  mobile computing devices integrated with wireless data communication modems  host computer equipment  industry specific application software  wireless connectivity software and a variety of services to manage and install these components  integrate them with an organization s existing computer systems  and configure or customize the software to meet customer requirements 
frequently  in the company s larger contracts only a limited number of the mobile computing devices and in vehicle equipment are installed initially  with the balance implemented over a rollout period that may extend up to one year or more 
where increases in mobile work forces require  or where additional departments of mobile workers are added  additional mobile computing devices may be installed 
revenue for software and services has historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
typically  the company enters into a fixed price contract with a customer for the licensing of selected software products and the provision of specific services that are generally performed within six to twelve months 
pricing for these contracts includes license fees as well as a fee for professional services 
the company generally recognizes total revenue for software and services associated with a contract using a percentage of completion method based on the total costs incurred over the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
commencing in the third quarter of  the company began generating revenues from the sale of mobile computing and infrastructure equipment as a result of the acquisition of mdsi uk 
the company s contracts with customers in the taxi  courier and roadside recovery markets generally require the company to provide mobile computing devices and wireless data communications network equipment 
revenues for these products are recognized at the time of transfer of title 
the company s customers typically enter into ongoing maintenance agreements that provide for maintenance  product enhancement and technical support services for a period commencing after expiration of the initial warranty period 
maintenance agreements typically have a term of twelve months and are invoiced either annually or monthly 
revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
prior to  mdsi typically supplied only the mdsi application and wireless connectivity software and related services as part of its contract with a customer 
the portion of contracts requiring the supply of third party products and services was not material and was not separated for revenue purposes 
beginning in  however  the company was called on to provide  in addition to mdsi products and services  certain third party products  such as host computer hardware and operating system software  mobile computing devices and radio data network infrastructure equipment  or sub contract services  such as radio data system design and implementation 
the company recognizes revenue for the supply of third party hardware upon transfer of title to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue for the supply of third party services using a percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred over the total estimated cost to complete the third party services contract 
the company believes that it will often supply some portion of third party products and services to customers where it is successful in selling its own products and services 
there can be no assurance  however  that any contracts entered into by the company to supply third party software and products in the future will represent a substantial portion of revenue in any future period 
since the revenue generated from the supply of third party products and services may represent a significant portion of certain contracts and the installation and rollout of third party products is generally at the discretion of the customer  the company may  depending on the level of third party products and services provided during a period  experience large quarterly fluctuations in revenue 
prior to  the company achieved a gross margin of on its consolidated revenue 
the gross margins achieved on revenue from the mdsi uk operations during the three years prior to its acquisition by the company ranged from to 
in addition  since the commencement of sales of third party products and services in  the company has achieved gross margins of approximately on revenue attributable to such products and services 
accordingly  the company expects that its consolidated gross margins in future periods will be lower than those achieved by mdsi prior to the mdsi uk acquisition and that changes in the mix of these revenues in any period will result in significant fluctuations in direct costs  gross profits  operating results and other items expressed as a percentage of revenue 
the company s revenue is dependent  in large part  on significant contracts from a limited number of customers 
as a result  any substantial delay in the company s completion of a contract  the inability of the company to obtain new contracts or the cancellation of an existing contract by a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s contracts are generally cancelable upon notice by the customer 
the loss of certain contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from period to period 
effects of acquisitions the consolidated financial statements of the company reflect the acquisitions of alliance effective april  and mdsi uk on june  these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method 
the company acquired mdsi uk on june  mdsi uk develops  markets  implements and supports mobile workforce management application software  wireless connectivity software  wireless data network equipment  mobile computing devices and related in vehicle equipment used by customers principally in the taxi  courier and roadside recovery markets

derivative financial instruments it is the policy of the company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company does enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the ordinary course of business to protect itself from adverse currency rate fluctuations on certain firm foreign currency transactions 
the company may also utilize foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge net assets on liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts are generally for eighteen months or less 
gains or losses relating to hedging firm commitments are deferred and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge 
the company s foreign currency forward contracts are executed with credit worthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
no foreign currency forward contracts were entered into during year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
computer equipment  software and other devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to manufacture products  acquire or ship products  process transactions  send invoices  or engage in other normal business activities 
the inability of business processes to function correctly in could have serious adverse effects on companies and entities throughout the world 
in the company established a team of professionals within the company to plan and implement its year compliance initiative 
the company has developed and is implementing a company wide year plan the plan to ensure that its computer equipment and software with date sensitive embedded technology will be able to distinguish the year and the and will function properly with respect to all dates referred to as year compliant 
the company presently believes that its planned modifications or replacements of certain existing computer equipment and software will be completed on a timely basis so as to minimize potential year related disruptions or malfunctions of its computer equipment and software 
the company s plan focuses on internal systems  including personal computing  facilities and business systems  and third party considerations  including products and suppliers 
the tasks common to each of these areas are i the identification and assessment of year issues  ii assessment of remediation required  iii prioritization of risk  iv remediation and testing and v contingency planning 
internal systems the company s compliance team has evaluated significant internal personal computing and business systems that are critical to the ongoing operation of the company and has identified the computer hardware and software upgrades and replacements necessary to make such systems year compliant 
such upgrades and replacements are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company is reviewing its present financial systems and its long term business system requirements 
any decision to purchase and implement new systems will include the requirement that such systems be year compliant 
customers the company is a software developer and has been testing its software internally and in conjunction with customers for year readiness 
the company believes that all its current products are year compliant and believes that it has identified and informed all its customers of the steps that are required to make software previously purchased by such customers year compliant 
the company s software runs on a variety of third party computers and operating systems 
while the company is not obligated to ensure that third party suppliers are year compliant  the company has suggested to customers that they utililize available year remedies 
the company is assisting its customers with year validation efforts including synchronization of year upgrades and testing  to eliminate implementation of non compatible solutions by customers 
there is also the possibility that in the coming year corporations in dealing with their own year issues will defer some software purchases except for the most urgent and those relevant to solving their own year concerns 
to the extent that this occurs  it could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
suppliers the company has identified its third party software and  in conjunction with its vendors  has considered possible remediation requirements 
after review and consultation  the company has determined that no updates are required to make existing software year compliant 
business operations will also be dependent on the year readiness of infrastructure suppliers such as banking  communications  transportation and other services 
in this environment  there will likely be instances of failure that could cause disruptions in business processes 
the likelihood and effects of such failures in infrastructure systems and the supply chain cannot be estimated 
costs the total cost of the company s year plan is not material to the company s financial condition 
the estimated total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately  and is being funded through operating cash flow 
as at december   the company had incurred approximately  in costs related to its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the major portion of the remaining amount of the estimate is expected to have been incurred by the end of the second quarter of when the company s year compliance efforts are expected to be completed  with the balance expended thereafter to monitor the compliance process 
none of the company s other projects have been delayed or deferred as a result of the implementation of the year compliance plan 
risks to date  the company has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  material costs to review and remedy year compliance problems 
although the company believes that its products are year compliant  failure to provide year compliant solutions to its customers or to receive such business solutions from its suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
furthermore  the company may incur additional expense if its products are used by customers on third party hardware and operating systems that are not year compliant  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
there can be no assurance that the systems or products of other entities  including the company s suppliers on which the company relies  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year  issues  and disruptions caused by customers deferring their purchase decisions or implementation plans due to their own internal year remediation activities  will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the preceding year discussion contains various forward looking statements which represent the company s beliefs or expectations regarding future events 
these forward looking statements include the company s expectations and beliefs as to the most likely scenarios or occurrences 
all forward looking statements  however  involve a number of risks which and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from projected results 
contingency plans as part of its continuing assessment of its year compliance requirements  the company has developed contingency plans to deal with what it feels is its worst case scenario 
this contingency plan revolves around a staff team of information technology professionals that will be available during the year date change period and the facilities to support that staff 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risk is foreign currency exchange rates 
the company has established procedures to manage sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of the company s net exposure to each foreign currency and the use of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge firm exposures to currencies other than the canadian and united states dollars and the great britain pound 
the company has operations in the united states and great britain in addition to its canadian operations and did not hedge these exposures in however  the company may from time to time hedge any net exposure to the united states dollar and the great britain pound 
as of december   the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates applied to the foreign currency sensitive contracts and assets would be approximately million 
the foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all foreign currencies  to which the company is exposed  would simultaneously change by 
such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with anticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currencies or future forward contracts entered into for hedging purposes 
subsequent to december   the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts in respect of net exposures under customer contracts to the belgian franc and danish kroner 
effective january   the belgian franc is tied to the euro  the new european union common currency 
the effect of the subsequent transactions is to reduce the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates to million 
the company does not have any material exposure to interest or commodity risks 
the company is exposed to economic and political changes in international markets where the company competes such as inflation rates  recession  foreign ownership restrictions and other external factors over which the company has no control  domestic and foreign government spending  budgetary and trade policies
