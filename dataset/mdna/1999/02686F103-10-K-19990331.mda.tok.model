in addition  the initial limited partner contributed  to the capital of the partnership and received units of limited partnership interest in exchange therefor 
criimi  inc the general partner holds a partnership interest of 
criimi  inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of criimi mae inc 
criimi mae 
prior to june   criimi mae was managed by an advisor whose general partner is cri  inc cri 
however  effective june   criimi mae became a self administered real estate investment trust reit and  as a result  the advisor no longer advises criimi mae 
aim acquisition partners  lp  the advisor serves as the advisor to the partnership 
the general partner of the advisor is aim acquisition corporation aim acquisition and the limited partners include  but are not limited to  aim acquisition  the goldman sachs group  lp  broad  inc and criimi mae 
pursuant to the terms of certain amendments to the partnership agreement the general partner is required to receive the consent of the advisor prior to taking certain significant actions which affect the management and policies of the partnership 
effective september  and through june   a sub advisory agreement the sub advisory agreement existed whereby cri aim management  inc  an affiliate of cri  managed the partnership s portfolio 
in connection with the transaction in which criimi mae became a self administered reit  an affiliate of criimi mae acquired the sub advisory agreement 
as a consequence of this transaction  effective june   cmslp  an affiliate of criimi mae  manages the partnership s portfolio 
these transactions had no effect on the partnership s financial statements 
on october   criimi mae  the parent of the general partner  and the parent of aim investments  lp  and criimi mae management  inc  an affiliate of criimi mae and provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership  filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a debtor in possession  criimi mae will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the general partner without approval from the bankruptcy court 
this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued partner and the partnership  however  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership 
such bankruptcy filing could also result in the potential need to replace criimi mae management  inc as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership 
year the year issue is a computer programming issue that may affect many electronic processing systems 
until relatively recently  in order to minimize the length of data fields  most date sensitive programs eliminated the first two digits of the year 
this issue could affect information technology it systems and date sensitive embedded technology that controls certain systems such as telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
leaving them unable to properly recognize or distinguish dates in the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
this treatment could result in significant miscalculations when processing critical date sensitive information relating to dates after december  the general partner is currently in the process of assessing and testing year compliance of its it systems  which include software systems to administer and manage mortgage assets and for internal accounting purposes 
a majority of the it systems used by the partnership is licensed from third parties 
these third parties have either provided upgrades to existing systems or have indicated that their systems are year compliant 
the general partner has applied upgrades and has completed a substantial amount of compliance testing as of march  there can be no assurance  however  that the partnership s it systems will be year compliant by december  the year issue may also affect the partnership s date sensitive embedded technology  which controls systems such as the telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
the general partner does not believe that the cost to modify or replace such technology to make it year compliant will be material 
the failure of any such systems to be year compliant could be material to the partnership 
the potential impact of the year issue depends not only on the corrective measures the general partner has undertaken and will undertake  but also on the ways in which the year issue is addressed by third parties with whom the partnership directly interfaces or whose financial condition or operations are important to the partnership 
the partnership has initiated communications with third parties with which it directly interfaces to evaluate the risk of their failure to be year compliant and the extent to which the partnership may be vulnerable to such failure 
there can be no assurance that part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the systems of these third parties will be year compliant by december  the failure of these third parties to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the partnership 
the partnership believes that its greatest risk with respect to the year issue relates to failures by third parties to be year compliant 
in addition to risks posed by third parties with which the partnership interfaces directly  risks are created by third parties providing services to large segments of society 
the failure of third parties to be year compliant could  among other things  cause disruptions in the capital and real estate markets and borrower defaults on real estate loans and mortgage backed securities as well as the pools of mortgage loans underlying such securities 
the partnership believes that its greatest exposure to the year issue involves the loan servicing operations of an affiliate of the partnership that rely on computers to process and manage loans 
an affiliate of the partnership  cmslp  currently services approximately of the total loans in the aim funds 
cmslp has applied a vendor upgrade and has substantially completed compliance testing on the upgrade 
currently the general partner estimates the cost of system upgrades related to year issues to be immaterial 
although the general partner has substantially completed its compliance testing and remediation  it is also in the process of developing contingency plans for the risks of the failure of the partnership or third parties to be year compliant 
the general partner intends to complete contingency plans for the year issue by may  due to the inability to predict all of the potential problems that may arise from the year issue  there can be no assurance that all contingencies will be adequately addressed by such plans

the mortgages underlying the fha insured certificates  gnma mortgage backed securities  and fha insured loans are non recourse first liens on multifamily residential developments or retirement homes 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following is a discussion of the partnership s insured mortgage investments  along with the risks related to each type of investment a 
fully insured originated insured mortgages and acquired insured mortgages listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fully insured mortgages as of december  and december  fully insured originated insured number of mortgages amortized cost   face value   fair value   fully insured acquired insured number of gnma mortgage backed securities fha insured certificates fha insured loan amortized cost   face value   fair value   in march  the mortgage on oak grove apartments was prepaid

the partnership received net proceeds of approximately million and million and recognized a gain of approximately  and a loss of approximately  for the mortgages on iroquois club apartments and greenbriar place  respectively 
a distribution of per unit related to these prepayments was declared in march and is expected to be paid in may as of march   all of the partnership s fully insured mortgage investments are current with respect to the payment of principal and interest 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition to base interest payments from fully insured originated insured mortgages  the partnership is entitled to additional interest based on a percentage of the net cash flow from the underlying development and of the net proceeds from the refinancing  sale or other disposition of the underlying development referred to as participations 
during the years ended december   and  the partnership received additional interest of   and  respectively  from the fully insured participations 
these amounts are included in mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income 
b 
coinsured mortgages under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such case  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as of december  and  the partnership had invested in three fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages 
as of december   two of the three fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages are coinsured by an unaffiliated third party coinsurance lender  the patrician mortgage company patrician  under the hud coinsurance program 
the three coinsured mortgages have been delinquent with respect to the payment of principal and interest 
the following is a discussion of the performance problems with respect to the partnership s coinsured mortgage investments 
coinsured by third party listed below are the originated insured mortgages co insured by patrician december  december  amortized face fair amortized face fair cost value value cost value value the villas       st 
charles place phase ii       total       as of march   the mortgagor has made payments of principal and interest due on the original mortgage on the villas through november  and has made payments of principal and interest due under a modification agreement with the villas through august as the result of bankruptcy proceedings that have been ongoing since  the property was acquired and vested with patrician in november patrician is in the process of improving the property and intends to file its initial claim with hud by october a coinsurance claim will be filed with hud for remaining amounts not collected as a result of the disposition 
due to deferred maintenance and tax deficiencies  the partnership does not expect cash flow to be realized from this property until the property is sold and claims are filed with hud for multifamily coinsurance benefits 
this amount represents the partnership s approximate ownership interest in the mortgage 
the remaining ownership interest is held by american insured mortgage investors lp series aim  an affiliate of the partnership 
as of march   the mortgagor has made payments of principal and interest due on the mortgage through november as the result of bankruptcy proceedings that have been ongoing since  the property was acquired and vested with patrician in november patrician is in the process of improving the property and intends to file its initial claim with hud by october a coinsurance claim will be filed with hud for remaining amounts not collected as a result of the disposition 
due to deferred maintenance and tax deficiencies  the partnership does not expect cash flow to be realized from this property until the property is sold and claims are filed with hud for multifamily coinsurance benefits 
the general partner intends to continue to oversee the partnership s interest in these mortgages to ensure that patrician meets its coinsurance obligations 
the general partner s assessment of the realizability of the villas and part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued st 
charles place phase ii mortgages is based on the most recent information available  and to the extent these conditions change or additional information becomes available  then the general partners assessment may change 
however  the general partner does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial condition or its results of operations should patrician be unable to comply with its full coinsurance obligation 
coinsured by affiliate as of december  and  the partnership held an investment in one fha insured certificate  secured by a coinsured mortgage where the coinsurance lender is integrated funding  inc ifi  an affiliate of the partnership 
the partnership bears the risk of loss upon default for ifi s portion of the coinsurance loss 
cumulative amortized face fair amortized face fair loan losses cost value value cost value value recognized spring lake village        in march  ifi completed foreclosure proceedings and obtained title to this property 
a purchase and sale agreement is expected to be ratified in march with a projected settlement date by the end of the second quarter subsequent to sale and settlement  a claim will be filed with hud 
the partnership expects that the claim will result in the recovery of a significant portion of amounts due 
in connection with the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages  the partnership has sought  in addition to base interest payments  additional interest commonly termed participations based on a percentage of the net cash flow from the development and the net proceeds from the refinancing  sale or other disposition of the underlying development 
all of the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages contain such participations 
during the years ended december   and  the partnership received additional interest of  and  respectively  from the coinsured participations 
these amounts are included in mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments are the partnership s principal source of cash flow  and were sufficient for the years ended december   and the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base  resulting from monthly mortgage payments or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in mortgage investment income  as discussed previously  along with an increase in receivables and other assets caused by the partnership s decision to no longer accrue interest on delinquent coinsured mortgages as of january net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages 
additionally  principal received from scheduled payments decreased in due to mortgage dispositions 
net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly for as compared to due to a reduction in the amount of distributions paid to partners in cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in mortgage investment income  as discussed above 
in addition  receivables and other assets increased resulting from additional delinquent mortgage payments from the villas  st 
charles place phase ii and spring lake village mortgages 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages 
there were two prepayments on mortgages in and four prepayments on mortgages in net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to  due to the timing of distribution of proceeds from the disposition of mortgages received in november and december and distributed in february and may item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates in the us treasury market  which coupled with the related spread to treasury investors required for the partnership s insured mortgages  will cause fluctuations in the market value of the partnership s assets
