the reimbursement amount may not exceed per share for  shares or for  shares

the company does not  and has not historically  required significant amounts of working capital for its day to day operations 
the company believes that its current cash positions and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company believes that  at its current market price  its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund any reimbursement amount in the event that aol elects after may  to sell its shares of the company s common stock at a price below per share and that  alternatively  it also has the ability to obtain the necessary financing to find its obligations under the aol investment agreement 
should the company seek to raise additional capital  there can be no assurance that  given current market conditions  the company would be able to raise such additional capital on terms acceptable to the company 
year the year issue refers to the potential harm from computer programs that identify dates by the last two digits of the year rather than using the full four digits 
such programs could fail due to misidentification of dates on or after january  if such a failure were to occur to the company s internal computer based systems or to the crucial computer based systems operated by third parties  the company could be unable to continue to provide telecommunications services  to sign up new customers or to bill existing customers for services 
such failures  if they occurred  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
however  because of the complexity of the issues  the number of parties involved and the fact that many of the issues are outside the company s control  the company cannot reasonably predict with certainty the nature or likelihood of such effects 
the company  using its internal staff  has conducted a review of most of its internal computer based systems 
most of the company s systems are relatively new 
much of the software used by the company has been developed internally and is regularly modified and updated to meet the changing requirements of its business 
the company expects that its critical internal systems will be able to process relevant date information in the future to permit the company to continue to provide its services without significant interruption or material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience unanticipated negative consequence caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems 
notwithstanding the company s expectation that its own systems will be able to process year date information  the company s business depends significantly on receiving uninterrupted services by other parties 
the principal service suppliers to the company include other switch based lonf distance providers  the local exchange carriers throughout the country and aol 
other parties whose ability to deal with year issues could affect the company include the company s partitions and the credit card companies through which most of the company s aol customers are billed 
the company has made inquiries of some of these parties regarding their respective levels of preparedness for year issues as they may affect the company 
the company will continue to make such inquiriesand will monitor the public disclosures of such companies regarding their year status 
so  far  the responses to such inquiries have been generally non committal regarding levels of preparedness or willingness to provide assurances to the company 
in almost all cases  the company is not in a position to require either affirmative action or assurances by these parties regarding continued provision of services in the year accordingly  while the company has not been advised by any of these other companies on which it depends that they do not expect to be ready for year issues  the company does not believe it is in a position to project the likelihood of such parties abilities to provide uninterrupted services to the company 
the company has considered possible contingency plans should one of these significant suppliers fail  including entering into multiple contracts with other long distance service providers obn network 
however  given the nature of the company s relationships with most of these significant suppliers  it may be impracticable for the company to replace them should they be unable to continue to provide these services 
the failure of any of these companies to provide uninterrupted service to the company would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations and financial condition 
the company does not separately identify costs incurred in connection with year compliance activities 
to date  however  the company does not believe such costs to be significant because they generally have been incurred in the normal course of internally modifying and updating the company s software programs 
future expenditures are not expected to be significant and will be funded out of operating cash flows

these forward looking statements are based on the company s current expectations 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and the company s actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations 
important factors that could cause such actual results to differ materially include  among others  adverse developments in the company s relationship with aol  increased price competition for long distance services  failure of the marketing of long distance services under the aol agreement  attrition in the number of end users  and changes in government policy  regulation and enforcement 
the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward looking statements
