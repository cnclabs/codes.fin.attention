the company generally serves as the prime contractor for public sector customers such as federal  state and local governmental authorities in the states of nevada  arizona  utah and new mexico 
the company believes that specializing in structural concrete construction has contributed significantly to its revenue growth and provides it with an advantage in the competitive bidding process 
however  such specialization limits the types and sizes of projects upon which the company bids and may be a competitive disadvantage for projects in which the amount of work proposed to be completed by the prime contractor as compared to the amount of work which will be subcontracted by the prime contractor is a consideration in the bidding process 
the company primarily seeks public sector customers because public sector projects are less cyclical than private sector projects  payment is more reliable  work required by the project is generally standardized and little marketing expense is incurred in obtaining projects 
in  the company acquired certain assets  including the tradename  of akr contracting akr  an unaffiliated company in phoenix  arizona 
akr previously specialized in earthwork  grading and paving of residential subdivisions and commercial centers  but has since become increasingly involved in small publicly funded projects in arizona and new mexico 
through akr  the company entered into operating leases for a portable hot mix asphalt plant and related paving equipment and a rubberized asphalt plant 
the asphalt paving capabilities provide the company the opportunity to expand its existing geographic market and enhance its construction operations in its existing market 
to date  akr has assisted the company in its expansion into new mexico and a broadening of the work it performs in arizona 
moreover  the company believes the akr equipment improves its competitiveness and may generate increased revenues on projects that call for large quantities of asphaltic concrete  recycled asphalt or rubberized asphalt 
in  the company expanded its nevada construction industry activities with the formation of ready mix  inc rmi as a wholly owned subsidiary 
rmi manufactures and distributes ready mix concrete in las vegas  nv  and targets prospective customers such as concrete subcontractors  prime contractors  home builders  commercial and industrial property developers  pool builders and homeowners

by performing white paving work  the company may be able to increase its project revenue and earnings  reduce reliance on white paving subcontractors  maintain greater control over project schedules and improve the likelihood of being awarded projects in which the amount of work proposed to be completed on a project by the prime contractor is a consideration in the competitive bidding process

the company currently has available from a commercial bank a  operating line of credit at an interest rate of the commercial bank s prime plus  and a  operating line of credit at an interest rate of the commercial bank s prime plus 
lines of credit 
at december   and as of the filing date of this report  nothing had been drawn on either of the lines of credit 
under the lines of credit  the company is required to maintain certain levels of working capital  to promptly pay all its obligations and is precluded from conveying  selling or leasing all or substantially all of its assets 
at december   the company was in full compliance with all such covenants and there are no material covenants or restrictions in the lines of credit which the company believes would impair its operations 
the lines of credit expire september  the company anticipates that a substantial portion of the costs associated with a planned second ready mix plant and related equipment will be financed through bank financing and operating leases 
in addition  the company is currently leasing approximately ready mix trucks with estimated annual lease payments of  management believes that the company s cash reserves  together with its lines of credit and its capacity to enter into other financing arrangements are sufficient to fund its cash requirements for the next months and that the company s working capital will be adequate to fund its short term and long term requirements 
new accounting pronouncements disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas issued by the fasb is effective for financial statements with fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted 
sfas requires that public companies report certain information about operating segments  products  services and geographical areas in which they operate and their major customers 
the company adopted this accounting standard on january  impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations 
however  substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect the operations of the company for future periods 
year the company s has completed a comprehensive assessment of the internal information systems and applications that will be impacted by the year the company expects to make the necessary revisions or upgrades to its systems to render it year compliant 
the company s accounting software currently utilizes a four digit year field 
attention is also being focused on compliance efforts of key suppliers and customers 
the company could potentially experience disruptions to some aspects of its various activities and operations as a result of non compliant systems utilized by the company or unrelated third parties 
contingency plans are therefore under development to mitigate the extent of any such potential disruption to business operations 
based on preliminary information  the costs to the company of addressing potential year issues are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
there can be no assurance that the efforts or the contingency plans related to the company s systems  or those of the other entities relied upon will be successful or that any failure to convert  upgrade or appropriately plan for contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies the company has increasingly drawn the interest and attention of an afl cio funded organization known as the building trades organizing project btop 
the stated purpose of the btop is to organize the workforce of non union companies 
notwithstanding its stated purpose and the fact that it currently owns shares of the company s common stock  the actions taken by the btop relative to the company have generally been contrary to the interests of the company s other shareholders 
these actions include hindering the company s productivity by organizing pickets on certain nevada job sites  filing unfounded unfair labor charges to date the company has successfully prevailed on all charges brought against the company and interfering with the work of subcontractors and suppliers 
in addition  the btop has issued press releases wherein the facts were incomplete  mistaken  misleading  blatantly false or stated erroneous conclusions 
unfortunately  all too frequently the wire services have mistakenly attributed to the company statements made in the btop press releases 
on one occasion  this caused a dramatic decline in the value of the company s common stock 
the btop is now seeking to inhibit the company s ongoing operations by requesting that all transactions with related parties be subject to shareholder approval 
the btop has also had direct contact with two of the company s customers  the nevada department of transportation and the new mexico state highway and transportation department  with the apparent intent of restricting the company s contractual rights and its ability to continue to obtain future contracts 
the company has successfully minimized the impact of the btop s actions on the construction projects  but has  as yet  been unable to prevent btop from issuing damaging press releases 
it can be anticipated that  barring successful legal action  if any  by the company the btop will continue to use the same tactics in dealing with the company in the future 
subject to the company s profitability and increases in retained earnings  it is anticipated that the bonding limits will increase proportionately  thereby allowing the company to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
the company believes that government at all levels will continue to be the primary source of funding for infrastructure work 
one june   the transportation equity act for the st century tea was signed into law 
this bill establishes a total budget authority of billion over the six year period tea ensures that tax revenue deposited into the highway trust fund will be spent on transportation improvements by guaranteeing billion for highways and billion for transit and by further stipulating that appropriators can spend trust fund dollars only on transportation 
see market overview 
the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract award 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
design build projects also tend to be of more worth to the owner when the contract size is substantial  usually million or more 
in light of the rising needs for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current needs to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
seasonality the construction industry is seasonal  generally due to inclement weather occurring in the winter months 
accordingly  the company may experience a seasonal pattern in its operating results with lower revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year than other quarters 
quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of bid solicitations by governmental authorities  the stage of completion of major projects and revenue recognition policies 
results for any one quarter  therefore  may not be indicative of results for other quarters or for the year
