item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained in item of this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results may differ materially as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in this report and other risks detailed from time to time in our periodic reports 
overview scansoft  inc was incorporated as visioneer  inc 
in california in march  and commenced shipment of our initial product in the first quarter of through september  we financed our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  from which we raised an aggregate of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in december  we reincorporated in delaware in conjunction with our initial public offering and raised million  net of issuance costs 
in january  the over allotment option granted to the underwriters in the initial public offering was exercised  resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately million 
we have experienced sequential growth in annual net revenues since the first year of product shipments 
the annual growth rates between and were directly attributable to the growth of the sheetfed scanner and document management software markets  the development of oem relationships and new product introductions 
in contrast  the single digit growth rate from to was attributed to several factors 
first  the grayscale sheetfed scanner market declined sharply with the advent of color sheetfed scanners 
the transition of the market from grayscale to color occurred at a much faster rate than we had anticipated  and as a result  we recorded significant charges relating to grayscale inventory reserves  purchase order commitments and price protection charges in the first half of second  we were late in introducing a color scanner product  and as a result  did not capture planned market share 
third  increased competition caused overall sheetfed scanner average selling prices to drop significantly 
finally  the growth of the sheetfed scanner market has leveled off  and  in fact  may be decreasing in size 
a key component of our business strategy in and was to penetrate the much larger and growing flatbed market by leveraging off of our software 
historically  we have bundled our paperport software with our scanner products  which has provided significant product differentiation 
the paperport flatbed scanner line was introduced in september this line was enhanced with the introduction of additional bit products as well as the entire bit and one touch line of flatbed scanners in in addition  our focus over time has shifted from the hardware business to the software business 
during we implemented a strategy to focus our research and development efforts on software development rather than hardware development and to leverage the engineering resources of our manufacturing partners to design future hardware products 
in furtherance of this strategy  on december   we entered into an agreement to sell our hardware business and the visioneer brand name to primax  and to merge with scansoft 
following the sale to primax and the merger with scansoft  our business will focus on software products in the paperport line  and the textbridge and pagis line of software products 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to maintain software gross margins and increase sales of our software products 
this will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our distributors  resellers and oem partners to convince end users to adopt paper and image input systems for the desktop and to educate end users about the benefits of our products 
there can be no assurance that the market for our products will develop or that we will achieve market acceptance of our products 
despite experiencing several quarters of minor levels of profitability throughout our history  we have incurred annual net losses since inception 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach quarterly profitability or attain annual profitability in the near future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as a result of the sale of our hardware business in january  our revenues will decline significantly in the first quarter of we expect our revenues to start improving gradually from the quarter ended june  as revenues from scansoft start impacting our operating results 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of total net revenues  certain selected financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december  year ended december  revenues product revenues royalty and development revenues total net revenues cost of revenues cost of product revenues cost of royalty and development revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring item total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense net loss see note of notes to financial statements total net revenues we derived our revenue primarily from three sources  the sale of paperport hardware products  paperport software products  and royalties and custom software development revenue earned pursuant to arrangements with certain oem customers 
through the end of  approximately of our product revenues have been derived from sales of our paperport products to authorized resellers and independent distributors in north america and  to a lesser extent  in europe and the asia pacific regions 
revenues from all sales to distributors and authorized resellers are subject to agreements allowing price protection and certain rights of return 
under the price protection rights granted by us  if we lower our selling price  we are then obligated to issue credit to our distributors and resellers equal to the difference between the new selling price and the price paid for all unsold inventory held by the distributor and reseller 
accordingly  reserves for estimated future returns  exchanges and price protection are provided upon revenue recognition 
total net revenues increased to million in from million in  despite a reduction in royalty and development revenues from million in to million in the decline in royalty revenues in was due to the termination  in the third quarter of  of royalties under an oem agreement with hewlett packard and the termination of royalties under our oem agreement with compaq in the first quarter of in regards to another oem agreement with hewlett packard  which involved the licensing of our software for hewlett packard scanners  hewlett packard informed us  in the fourth quarter of  that commencing january   it would no longer be building new scanner products incorporating our software 
we experienced declining royalties from this agreement in as hewlett packard sold existing inventory of products incorporating our software which it held at december  net revenues from hardware product sales increased to million in compared to million in as a result of the addition of the paperport bit and onetouch flatbed color scanner lines in  overall scanner unit sales in increased by approximately over  despite a decrease in grayscale scanner unit sales 
revenues did not increase at the same rate as unit increases because of the sharp decline in average retail prices offset the net revenue from the increased hardware unit sales from to software revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the commencement of sales of new paperport software products that included proocr  paperport scannersuite  visual explorer  and paperport deluxe released in the second quarter of total net revenues increased to million in from million in  despite a reduction in royalty and development revenues from million in to million in the decline in royalty revenue in was due to the termination of the royalties associated with our oem agreement with hewlett packard and our oem agreement with compaq computers 
our second oem agreement with hewlett packard  which related to the licensing of our software for hewlett packard scanners  was terminated in the fourth quarter of our ability to increase our revenues will depend upon our ability to attain wider market acceptance for our software products and our ability to introduce new products with enhanced end user features on a timely basis 
as a result of the sale of our hardware assets  liabilities and intellectual property to primax electronics  ltd  our revenues will be substantially reduced in  even taking into consideration the addition of revenues from the merger with scansoft 
our four largest resellers for were sam s club  office depot  inc  best buy company  inc 
and compusa  inc 
for distribution of our products in north america 
sales to these top four independent resellers accounted for of our total net revenues in in the aggregate  or   and  respectively 
our four largest resellers and distributors of our products in were ingram  best buy  office depot and micro warehouse 
sales to these independent distributors and resellers  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total net revenues in the four largest distributors and resellers in were ingram  best buy  tech data and merisel 
sales to these independent distributors  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in in  all four of our top customers were resellers compared to  when three out of four of our largest customers  excluding oems  were resellers 
in contrast in  three out of four of our customers were distributors 
we have focused on establishing direct relationships with major resellers  thus bypassing distributors 
this strategy  to a limited extent  reduces a layer of our inventory in the retail channel  thereby reducing inventory risk and increasing channel inventory visibility 
total net revenues from independent distributors outside north america  primarily in europe and the asia pacific regions  were approximately  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
net revenues from international sales increased from million in to million in  whereas sales decreased from million in to million in the reduction in international revenues from to was primarily due to the delayed introduction of japanese localized paperport strobe products  the first of which were shipped in february  and our decision to restructure our international sales and marketing operations in may although our international sales are all denominated in us dollars  these sales are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  import and export duties and restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and the logistical difficulties of managing multinational operations  any of which could adversely impact the success of our international operations 
the growth of our international business will depend  in part  on our ability to increase awareness of our products in international markets 
see item business marketing  sales and distribution 
the introduction of major new software products and enhancements of existing products  such as paperport deluxe  as well as potential oem agreements  are expected to have a significant impact on our quarterly and annual revenues 
as is characteristic of the initial stages of personal computer product life cycles  we expect that sales volumes of any new software product may increase in the first few months following introduction due to the purchase of initial inventory by our distribution channel 
thereafter  revenues may stabilize or decline until the end of a product life cycle  at which time revenues are likely to decline significantly  as a result of unit sales and price reductions 
at the end of a product life cycle we may experience higher rates of return and or increased price protection charges as a result of price reductions 
this could have a material adverse impact on our total net revenues and operating results 
although we have sought to mitigate the effect of such transition by controlling inventory levels of our distributors and resellers  channel inventory levels are very difficult to quantify accurately  and we may experience higher than normal rates of return on our older version products and may incur significant price protection charges in connection with our planned release of new paperport products and price reductions in in this regard  receivable allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
a substantial portion of these reserves related to the hardware business and were eliminated as part of the sale to primax on january  due to the inherent uncertainties of product development and new product introductions  we cannot accurately predict the exact quarter in which a new product or version will be ready to ship 
any delay in the scheduled release of major new products would have a material adverse impact on our total net revenues and operating results 
we have experienced and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors  many of which are outside of our direct control 
after taking into consideration the sale of our hardware business in january  and the merger with scansoft in march  these factors include the integration of the visioneer and scansoft businesses  development of the paper input systems market  demand for our products  our success in developing  introducing and shipping new products and product enhancements  the market acceptance of such products  our ability to respond to new product introductions and price reductions by our competitors  the timing  cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  the purchasing patterns and potential product returns from our distribution channels  our relationships with our oem partners and distributors  our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  the timing and amount of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenditures  and general economic conditions 
revenues and operating results in any quarter depend  to a large extent  on the volume  timing and ability to fulfill customer orders  which is difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed  based in large part on our forecasts of future sales 
if sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse effect of a shortfall in sales on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses to compensate for such shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our expectations would have an immediate material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may also be required to reduce prices in response to competition or to increase our spending to pursue new product or market opportunities 
in the event of significant price competition in the market for our products  which is anticipated  we will be required to decrease costs at least proportionately and we will be at a significant disadvantage with respect to our competitors that have substantially greater resources 
such competitors may more readily withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
in such event  we will also incur price protection charges from our distributors 
any price protection charges in excess of recorded allowances would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that at some point in the future our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies participating in new and rapidly evolving markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks 
total cost of revenues total cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with the purchase of paperport products and related costs of freight  inventory rework  inventory obsolescence and warranty 
for  our paperport hardware products were manufactured  assembled and tested by five manufacturing partners  avision  primax  flextronics  nmb and orient semiconductor 
grayscale sheetfed scanners were manufactured by flextronics 
our scanning keyboard  paperport ix  and the color sheetfed scanner  the paperport strobe  were manufactured by nmb and orient semiconductor  and the paperport flatbed scanners were manufactured by primax and avision 
we sold our hardware business to primax in january our software products are manufactured by dcl  which also package and ships the majority of our hardware and software products to our customers 
see item business manufacturing 
total cost of revenues  as a percentage of total net revenues  decreased in to as compared to in the decrease was primarily a result of approximately million of charges taken in the first quarter of for write offs and increased reserves relating to excess and obsolete grayscale inventory and cancellation charges relating to adverse purchase commitments for grayscale products 
total cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was in as compared to in the increase was primarily a result of the charges taken in as described above 
as a result of the sale of our hardware business  we expect our total cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenue  to decline significantly from the historical levels reported in the statement of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist principally of personnel costs  costs of contractors and outside consultants  supplies and material expenses  equipment depreciation and overhead costs relating to occupancy 
as of december   we employed full time and contract software design engineers  technicians and support staff 
upon the completion of the merger on march   we employed full time technicians and support staff 
research and development expenses were  and of total net revenues for  and  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in from million in due to our strategy to concentrate our engineering efforts on software development  all of our flatbed scanner lines that were introduced in and were designed in cooperation with our manufacturing partners  primax and avision 
research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of the restructuring of the engineering group in may we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success 
accordingly  we will continue to invest in research and development activities 
however  such expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a wide range of factors including the status of various development projects 
to date  we have not capitalized any development costs and do not anticipate capitalizing any such costs in the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include advertising  commissions to manufacturers representative organizations  co op paid to our distributors and resellers  trade shows and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in from million in  and also declined as a percentage of total net revenues  to in from in the decrease was the direct result of a company wide restructuring plan implemented in may  in which we reduced overall headcount and spending by approximately of first quarter levels  as well as an additional restructuring in august which cut existing headcount by an additional 
we believe that these spending reductions were necessary in order to reduce our cost structure to allow us to compete more effectively 
as noted below  the may restructuring resulted in a  one time charge 
the restructuring in august did not result in a significant one time charge 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in from million in as a percentage of total net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the decrease in spending was primarily attributed to the restructuring plan implemented in may  described above 
we will continue to attempt to control selling  general and administrative expenses 
however  if net revenues continue to grow  in order to support our growing operations  selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute terms 
such expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a variety of factors  including the timing of the introduction of any new products  expansion of our distribution channels  general advertising not related to product introductions and expansion into international markets 
non recurring item the non recurring item in represents expenses incurred for severance and other charges related to the termination of approximately employees and contract employees in connection with the company wide restructuring plan implemented in may the restructuring actions were fully completed as of december other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income  net  was   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in other income  net from to  and to was a result of decreased interest income from significantly lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which were used primarily to fund our operating losses 
taxation at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  of which approximately  related to tax deductions from stock compensation 
the tax benefit related to the stock compensation benefit  when realized  will be accounted for as an addition to additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for income tax 
research and development credit carryforwards as of december  were approximately million 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as a result of the new stock issued in conjunction with the merger with scansoft  we are not certain whether we will be able to utilize our net operating loss and credit carryforwards without limitations 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources through september   we financed our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  from which it raised an aggregate of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in december  we completed our initial public offering  and raised approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in january  the over allotment option granted to the underwriters in the initial public offering was exercised  resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million  as compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of working capital at december  we used million of cash for our operating activities for  as compared to million for and million for negative cash flows from operating activities for these periods were attributed primarily to net losses incurred of million  million and million for  and  respectively  offset by non cash charges and changes in working capital 
cash provided by investing activities during was million as we decreased short term investments by million and made capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures for consisted primarily of purchases of manufacturing tools and molds  computer equipment and software tools 
cash provided by financing activities was million during at december   we had short term bank borrowings of million  and million was provided by proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and the exercises of stock options 
on march   we amended our million line of credit  increasing the line to million and extending the expiration date to march the line bore an interest rate of over the prime rate  and was collateralized by a security interest in our assets 
as of december   we had million of short term borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and we were not in compliance with all financial covenants under the agreement 
as a result of the sale of our hardware business to primax  we paid all amounts owed on the line  cancelled the line and obtained a waiver of covenant default for the period ended december  our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
subsequent to our year end  we sold our hardware business to primax for million 
in addition  the merger with scansoft provided additional cash of million with no associated long or short term debt 
based upon these events and existing cash balances  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will provide adequate cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  or increase or obtain additional lines of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders

to date  a vast majority of our product revenues have been derived from sales of our software products to authorized resellers and independent distributors 
total net revenues increased in from  due primarily to the increase in unit shipments of products offset partially by a decline in royalty revenues 
the decline in royalty revenues in was due to the termination  in the third quarter of  of royalties under our oem agreement with hewlett packard

year compliance we are aware of the potential business risks associated with the year millennium issue 
based upon this potential business risk  we have developed a strategy to examine the potential effect of this issue 
the following strategy outlines the process by which we are trying to minimize the potential risk associated with the year millennium issue 
we are in the process of assessing the potential effects of the year millennium change on our business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees  as well as our outsourcing vendors and critical suppliers 
our year project is proceeding on schedule 
the project goal is to ensure that our business is not impacted by the date transitions associated with the year our year project plan is coordinated by a team that reports to senior management 
the project team is evaluating the year compliance of our business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees  as well as our outsourcing vendors and critical suppliers who provide services relating to our business 
our year project is comprised of the following phases o phase inventory all business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees  in order to assign priorities to potentially impacted systems and services 
this phase was completed by january  and a complete inventory was compiled 
o phase assess the year compliance of all inventoried business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees  and determine whether to renovate or replace any non year compliant systems and services 
this phase was completed by march  o phase complete remediation  if any is required  of any non compliant business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees and outsourcing vendors 
conduct procurements to replace any other non year compliance business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees and outsourcing vendors that won t be remediated 
we expect to complete all remediation efforts  if any are required  by june  o phase test and validate remediated and replacement systems  if any such remediation or replacement is required  to ensure inter system compliance and mission critical system functionality 
we expect to complete testing and validation efforts  if any are required  by july  o phase deploy and implement remediated and replacement systems  if any deployment or implementation is required  after the completion of successful testing and validation 
we expect to complete the deployment and implementation of the remediated or replacement systems  if any is required  by september  o phase design contingency plan and business continuation plans in the event of the failure of business systems and processes  facilities  data networking infrastructure  software and components used by our employees due to the year millennium change 
we expect that the initial contingency and business continuation plan will be in place by november  based on our inventory and assessment to date  we believe that our internal mission critical systems are year compliant and that our facilities can be year compliant 
in addition  we are seeking assurances from our facilities landlords and equipment vendors and data circuit providers regarding the year compliance of their facilities and equipment 
at this time  we believe that our incremental remediation costs  if any  needed to make our current business systems and processes  including facilities  software and components used by our employees and outsourcing vendors  are not material 
while we are incurring some incremental costs  our incurred costs through december  were less than  our expected total costs  including remediation and replacement costs  if any  are estimated to be between  and  over the life of the year project 
we are contacting our hardware and software vendors  other significant suppliers  manufacturers  outsourcing service providers and other contracting parties to determine the extent to which we are vulnerable to any one of their failures to achieve year compliance for their own systems 
at the present time  we do not expect year issues of any such third parties to materially affect our business 
should we fail to solve a year compliance problem to our critical business systems and processes  the result could be a failure or interruption to normal business operations 
despite the assurances of our third party suppliers  hardware and software vendors  and outsourcing service providers regarding year compliance of their products and services  the potential exists that a year problem relating to such third party suppliers  vendors and outsourcing service providers products and services could have a material impact on our business 
we are conducting monthly discussions with our critical outsourcing service providers to determine the progress of their year compliance programs 
despite extensive preparation and effort to ensure year compliance  implementation of our business continuation contingency plan for a very short time may be required while we remediate the year problem 
despite our belief that our mission critical computer software applications and systems are year compliant and our expectation that our enhancement effort will result in year compliant systems  we are currently developing a business continuation contingency plan 
we expect to finalize our initial contingency plan to complete the testing of all existing systems by november  the foregoing year discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements  including without limitation  anticipated costs and the dates by which certain actions are expected to be completed  are based on management s best current estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third parties and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability to identify and remediate all relevant systems  results of year testing  adequate resolution of year issues by governmental agencies  businesses and other third parties who are outsourcing service providers suppliers and vendors  unanticipated system costs  the adequacy of and ability to implement contingency plans and similar uncertainties 
the forward looking statements made in the foregoing year discussion speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  and management does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment risk as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall
