item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in  we decided to change our business from the ownership of high risk cmbs bonds to the ownership  acquisition  development and management of manufactured home communities 
this decision helped us to avoid the volatility incurred by other owners of these securities following the capital market crisis in the third quarter of since our capital has not yet been entirely invested into this new business  our financial performance  and consequently our stock price  has been adversely affected during this period 
during the last few months we have been focused on the investment of our capital in the acquisition of manufactured home communities 
we believe that the investment of our capital will be substantially completed during  and we are hopeful that this will result in improved performance 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  due to the change in our business from investing in cmbs bonds to owning and operating manufactured home communities  the results of operations for are not comparable to rental property during  income from rental properties totaled  arising from our initial investments in manufactured home communities 
inflation we do not believe that changes in inflation rates would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in fact  we believe that inflation may positively impact our business  in light of the fact that manufactured home communities represent a more affordable housing choice for many people than other alternatives available  increased inflation rates may allow us to demand increased rents without losing tenants 
interest and other income interest and other income during was  compared to  for the increase is due to our temporary investment of the million of cash proceeds received in november from the restructuring of the cmbs bonds 
the average interest rates earned on these short term investments were and during and  respectively 
cmbs bonds income from cmbs bonds was  during compared to  for the earnings figures for represent the income from the retained equity interest of the resecuritization of two cmbs bonds 
all other income from the cmbs bonds ceased after the restructuring of the cmbs bonds in november general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to lower accounting and other expenses related to the ownership of cmbs bonds 
management fees during  we incurred base fees of  on investments in manufactured home communities  the retained equity interest from the cmbs bond resecuritization and the investment in westrec marinar management  inc we incurred no incentive fees or administrative fees in during  we incurred management fees of  consisting of base fees of  incentive fees of  and administrative fees of  we experienced a large decrease in management fees during because we do not incur such fees on cash equivalents and short term investments of our cash resources 
acquisition fees during  we incurred acquisition fees of  as a result of our investments in manufactured home communities 
during  we incurred acquisition fees of  on acquisitions of cmbs bonds 
the acquisition fees incurred in were capitalized as part of the cost of acquiring cmbs bonds 
acquisition fees were expensed in because the manager is asset investors  owner of of our common stock 
if these fees had been paid to an unrelated third party  then they would have been capitalized under generally accepted accounting principles 
for this reason  such fees are capitalized in our calculation of ffo 
costs related to potential marina investments during the third quarter of  we decided that we would no longer seek to acquire interests in marinas  and we expensed  of costs related to previously considered marina investments 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  interest income interest income in and was  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in as compared to is due to our investment of the proceeds from the restructuring of the cmbs bonds in short term investments 
the average interest rate earned on these funds was and in and  respectively 
cmbs bonds income from cmbs bonds was  during compared to  in earnings from cmbs bonds decreased by  because there were no earnings in november or december after the restructuring of the cbms bond portfolio 
this decrease was partially offset by higher income prior to the restructuring 
the income from the cmbs bonds prior to the restructuring was higher due to the prepayments made in august on one bond and the earnings on bonds acquired in march offset by income from the early redemption of two bonds in may and prepayments made on another bond in general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively  for and general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to lower stockholder relations expenses  lower consulting and accounting expenses and the elimination of expenses from dividend equivalent rights pursuant to the amendment to our stock option plan 
management fees management fee expenses were  and  respectively  for and the increase in management fees during compared with was due to an increase of  in incentive fees  offset by a decrease of  in base fees and administrative fees 
prior to the restructuring of the cmbs bond portfolio  our manager received an administrative fee of up to  per year for each cmbs bond 
the increase in incentive fees was due to higher reit income before incentive fees partially offset by an increase in the average ten year us treasury rate between and the increase in reit income was primarily a result of gains associated with the restructuring of the cmbs bonds and nonrecurring expenses incurred in while the increase in the average ten year us treasury rate had the effect of raising the threshold above which incentive fees are paid 
the decrease in base fees was due to the decrease in average invested assets as a result of the restructuring of our cmbs bonds 
dividend distributions during  we declared regular dividends of 
per share 
during each of and  we declared regular dividends of 
per share 
in addition  we declared special dividends of 
per share and 
per share in and  respectively  and a capital gains dividend of 
per share in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  our principal activities that demand liquidity include our normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  acquisitions of or additional investments in properties and payments of dividends to stockholders 
in  the net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  during the decrease was primarily a result of lower income from both short term investments and investments in manufactured home communities in than income from cmbs bonds in net cash used in investing activities was  during compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  in the net cash in was primarily used to acquire short term investments and investments in manufactured home communities 
investing activities in included  of net cash provided from the restructuring of the bonds 
net cash used in financing activities decreased to  in compared to  in  primarily due to lower dividends 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through our cash balances  short term investments  long term  secured borrowings  cash generated by operations and issuance of equity securities 
funds from operations we measure our economic profitability based on ffo  less an annual capital replacement reserve of at least per developed homesite 
we believe that ffo  less a reserve  provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
the board of governors of nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with nareit s definition 
in our calculation we include adjustments for o fees incurred in connection with property acquisitions  and o nonrecurring costs related to discontinued classes of investments 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
for  our ffo was as follows in thousands net income  real estate depreciation acquisition fees amortization of cmbs bonds costs related to potential marina investments funds from operations ffo  weighted average common shares outstanding  year compliance year issues have arisen because many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the following disclosure provides information regarding the current status of our year compliance program 
our critical hardware and software systems are currently year compliant 
upon failure of any system  data included in critical software such as rent rolls and certain record keeping systems could be transferred to alternative commercially available software at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time period 
consequently  we would be able to continue our business operations without any material interruption or material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we anticipate that any hardware or software that we acquire including upgrades to existing systems between now and december  will be year compliant 
disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
moreover  because a large number of our tenants may be dependent on social security payments to pay their rents  a failure of the social security administration to cause their systems to be year compliant may result in a material adverse effect on our operations 
the social security administration has announced that they will have their systems year compliant before january  we believe that the cost of modification or replacement of our less essential accounting and reporting software and hardware that is not currently compliant with year requirements  if any  will not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk is through our various debt instruments and borrowings 
the following is a list of these debt instruments and borrowing arrangements 
we invest funds primarily in government securities and other short term investments with interest rates of approximately above the london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  changes in interest rates could affect the returns from such investments 
we intend to invest funds in manufactured home communities during  however  the timing and amount of such investments will depend on a number of factors 
see business growth and operating strategies future acquisitions 
we do not currently have any notes payable but expect to borrow amounts in connection with acquisitions of communities 
we intend to borrow non recourse  secured  fixed rate  fully amortizing debt in connection with such acquisitions 
accordingly  such debt would not cause us significant exposure to changing interest rates
