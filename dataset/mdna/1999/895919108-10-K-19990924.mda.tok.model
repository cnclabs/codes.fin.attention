annual results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages that consolidated statement of operations items are to net sales for the years ended june   and year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations interest income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales net sales in fiscal decreased to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreases in unit volume shipments of approximately of graphical user interface gui accelerators and graphics controllers and a decline in average selling prices asps in the desktop area in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of portable products of million were approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately million or of the company s net sales in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal net sales in fiscal decreased to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decline in unit volume shipments and decreases in asps for gui accelerators and graphics controllers in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of portable products of million were approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately million or of the company s net sales in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal the company has made a major effort to design products to fill the needs of leading pc systems manufacturers as well as the needs of adapter card manufacturers 
sales to leading pc systems manufacturers represented approximately of net sales for fiscal  an increase from in fiscal  and a decrease from in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in hong kong  taiwan  korea and japan  accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales to two customers  fujitsu and innoquest  accounted for approximately and of net sales for fiscal  respectively 
sales to two customers  union computer and fujitsu  accounted for approximately and of net sales for fiscal  respectively  and sales to three customers  ibm  union computer  and jaton corporation accounted for approximately   and of net sales for fiscal  respectively 
substantially all of the sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all periods 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales to distributors 
sales to distributors represented and of net sales during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
during the first half of fiscal year the company experienced higher than usual returns resulting from certain distributors adjusting their inventory mix and levels 
the company plans to develop new and higher performance gui accelerators  graphics controllers and multimedia products to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia  north america and europe 
the company s future success depends upon its successful introduction of these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner  or that product specifications will not change during the development period 
in addition  even if such new products are successfully developed and shipped  there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the marketplace 
gross margin trident s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margins were generally lower in fiscal because of decreasing prices in desktop computers  and an increase in the cost of embedded dram for portable computers 
trident s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to decreasing prices in the personal computer industry and a product mix which was more heavily weighted from desktop computers which have lower margins than portable computer products 
the company believes that the prices of high technology products decline over time  as competition increases and new  advanced products are introduced 
the company expects asps of existing products to continue to decline  although the asps of the company s entire product line may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality which are planned to be sold at higher prices 
the company s strategy is to maintain and improve gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins through its custom design methodology and migration to new process technology  and reducing manufacturing costs by large volume production 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that it can reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased from million in fiscal research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the company s cost reduction efforts in fiscal the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in spending in multimedia engineering  graphics engineering  the taiwan research and development center and the start up of the shanghai research and development center 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenditures decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and were million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling expenditures were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenditures were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling costs have declined in fiscal years and due to the slow down in personal computer sales and reductions in marketing personnel 
general and administrative expenditures were higher in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to an increase in legal services 
general and administrative expenditures were lower in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to reductions in bonus expenses  personnel  and consulting services 
as a result of the company s cost reduction efforts  the company expects selling  general and administrative expenditures to remain at or below the levels for fiscal during fiscal interest income  net the amount of interest income earned by the company varies directly with the amount of its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and the prevailing interest rates 
net interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to lower cash balances in higher yielding short term investments 
net interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to cash investments being held in higher yielding certificates of deposit 
provision for income taxes no provision for income tax was taken in fiscal year due to the company s loss situation 
as a percentage of income before income taxes  the provision benefit for income tax was for fiscal year  and for fiscal years based on a number of factors  as of june  the company has provided a full valuation allowance 
these factors include primarily the inability to carryback tax attributes to prior federal tax returns as well as state returns  recent operating losses incurred by the company  and the fact that the market in which the company competes is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
factors that may affect our results trident has a history of losses  expects future losses and cannot assure you that it will achieve profitability we have experienced operating loses in the years ended june  and and expect to report operating losses for the next several quarters 
we cannot accurately predict when we will achieve profitability 
future performance will substantially depend upon numerous factors  such as timely introducing new products and product enhancements to the marketplace  whether customers successfully incorporate our technologies into end products with high levels of customer acceptance  fluctuating price levels for our products  and funding increased levels of research and development 
we anticipate that we will incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
trident s management is diligently trying to control operating expenses to enable trident to achieve profitability 
however  there is no guarantee that management s efforts will be successful 
a number of factors could continue to cause trident s quarterly financial results to significantly fluctuate we plan to tightly control our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing activities  broaden our customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels and fund increased levels of research and development 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors including fluctuations in demand for our products  including seasonality  unexpected product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to achieve required cost reductions  our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  delayed new product introductions  unfavorable responses to new products  adverse economic conditions  particularly in asia  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  and availability of foundry and assembly capacities 
if a key distributor or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  trident s revenues may decline and the price of its stock may fall to date  a limited number of distributors and customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
if any of our large distributors or customers stop or delay purchases  our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers  particularly in light of the high sales price per unit of our products and the length of our sales cycles 
while our financial performance depends on large orders from a few key distributors and other significant customers  we do not have binding commitments from any of them 
for example our customers can stop purchasing and our distributors can stop marketing our products at any time  our distributor agreements generally are not exclusive with no obligation of the distributor to renew the agreements  and our distributor agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
we have established a reserve program which  under specified conditions  enables distributors to return products to us 
the amount of potential product returns is estimated and provided for in the period of the sale 
actual returns could differ from our estimates 
trident depends upon international sales for much of its revenue and trident s ability to sustain and increase its international sales depends on successfully expanding its international operations because our distributors sell our products worldwide  changes in the global graphics marketplace  such as the shift in market share from asian clone makers to leading north american pc systems manufacturers  have affected and will continue to affect our operating results 
our revenues have been and are expected to be generated primarily from asian customers  particularly those of taiwan and hong kong 
additionally  our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales and operations which have and are expected to constitute a significant portion of our sales 
the failure of our distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in addition  there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  import or export licensing requirements  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
trident expects the average selling prices of its products to decrease rapidly which may reduce gross margins or revenue the graphics controller industry has experienced rapid erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures and rapid technological change 
we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of desktop computers will decrease in the future  while the cost of embedded dram for portable computers may increase  in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  to maintain our gross margins  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could materially adversely affect our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
intense competition in the market for graphics controllers could cause trident to experience additional adverse fluctuations in its operating results the market for graphics controllers is intensely competitive 
many of our current and potential competitors in both graphics and audio have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and market share than we do 
these competitors may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete 
to remain competitive  we believe we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  including products for new markets  increasing the ability of our products to integrate various functions and enhancing quality product performance 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenue and future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
if trident s products contain undetected defects  trident could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales although we establish and implement test specifications  impose quality standards upon our suppliers and perform separate application based compatibility and system testing  our products may contain undetected defects 
we have experienced such errors in the past and we expect that such errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may materially adversely affect our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and causing significant customer relations problems 
trident needs to expand its network of manufacturing operations and depends on independent foundries for substantially all of its manufacturing requirements if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we currently rely on a limited number of third party foundries to manufacture our products either in finished form or wafer form 
generally  these foundries are not obligated to manufacture our products for a fixed period or a specific quantity at a predetermined price 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with us or we encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components  our ability to meet customer orders could be materially adversely affected 
we have experienced a delay in product shipments from a contract manufacturer in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
such delays often force us to purchase at a higher per unit product cost from other foundries or to pay expediting charges so that we can obtain the required supply in a timely manner 
we may in the future experience delays in shipments from foundries or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our foundry relationships or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the unstable public market could cause trident s stock price to fall the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by trident or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and unfavorable conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors that generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of trident s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
trident s exchange of uicc shares for umc shares may pose some economic risks we expect to receive approximately million shares of umc stock in exchange for our shares of uicc by the end of this exchange may provide us with an improved balance sheet and additional capital but may be subject to resale restrictions and have a fair market value which fluctuates dramatically 
we have not received the umc shares nor have we determined whether or when we will sell the umc shares or the sales price if the sale occurs 
if trident or its key distributors and customers fail to be year compliant  trident s business may be severely disrupted and its revenues may decline the year computer issue creates a risk for us 
if systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on our operations 
the risk exists in four areas potential warranty or other claims from our customers  systems we use to run our business  systems used by our distributors  and the potential reduced spending by other companies on networking solutions as a result of significant information systems spending on year remediation 
we are currently evaluating our exposure in all of these areas 
we are in the process of conducting an inventory and evaluation of the information systems used to run our business 
systems which are identified as non compliant will be upgraded or replaced 
for the year non compliance issues identified to date  the cost of remediation is not expected to be material to our operating results 
however  if implementation of replacement systems is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  our operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we intend to contact our critical distributors to determine that the distributors operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
where practicable  we will attempt to mitigate our risks with respect to the failure of suppliers to be year ready 
however  failures remain a possibility and could have an adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition 
since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  we may see an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
in addition  litigation regarding year compliance issues is expected to escalate 
for these reasons  the impact of customer claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition 
businesses that face year compliance issues may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications to their computer systems and applications 
these companies may plan to devote a substantial portion of their information systems spending to fund such upgrades and modifications and divert spending away from ic videographics or audio products for the pc market 
this change in customers spending patterns could materially adversely impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year cash used in operating activities in fiscal year was million 
cash used in operating activities in was mainly due to unprofitable operations  increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  primarily offset by decreases in inventories and deferred taxes  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to unprofitable operations  an increase in inventory  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  primarily offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal years   and the company issued   and  shares of common stock under its employee stock option and purchase plans  respectively 
these issuances generated cash of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  the company invested million in cash in a privately held semiconductor design company for an equity interest of less than 
the investment is presented as a long term investment in the financial statements 
in august  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with umc and other venture partners to establish a foundry  uicc 
under the agreement  the company invested million in the joint venture and the foundry guarantees to trident a certain percentage of the foundry s total wafer supply 
on october   a fire at uicc s fabrication plant in hsin chu  taiwan  completely destroyed its fabrication equipment 
the fabrication plant  and the destroyed equipment  was insured 
in june the company announced that it has received confirmation from umc that  subject to the approval of the umc shareholders and the taiwan government  the uicc joint venture will be consolidated with umc by the end of trident expects to receive approximately million shares of umc stock in the consolidation 
these shares represent about of the outstanding stock of umc 
as the consolidation is subject to umc shareholder approval  no assurance can be given as to whether such shares will be received 
the company has not determined whether or when it will sell such shares and the shares may be subject to trading or other restrictions 
following the consolidation  trident will continue to have a guaranteed wafer supply from umc approximately the same in quantity as it had with uicc 
at june   the company held a equity ownership in uicc 
the company s investment in the uicc joint venture is intended to secure capacity so that it can meet expected increased demand  should it occur 
however  there are certain risks associated with the transaction including the company s ability  together with its partners  to fully utilize the capacity of uicc 
the company will continue to consider transactions to secure additional foundry capacity as circumstances warrant 
the agreement with umc has utilized a significant amount of trident s available funds  however  the company believes its current resources are sufficient to meet its needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company regularly considers transactions to finance its activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions 
the company believes its current reserves are adequate 
in april   the company s board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program over the next twelve months 
during fiscal year   shares of common stock were repurchased for million under this plan 
during fiscal year   shares of common stock were repurchased for million under this plan 
during fiscal year  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
the company s cash reserves may decline as a result of its future use  if any  of the repurchase program 
year some computers  software  and other equipment include computer code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches  and are referred to in this report as year issues 
the company has a year project designed to identify and assess the risks associated with its information systems  products  operations and infrastructure  and suppliers that are not year compliant and to develop  implement  and test remediation and contingency plans to mitigate these risks 
the project is composed of four phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  and implementation and testing 
information systems 
in  the company undertook a project to upgrade all its information systems to year compliance 
the company is in its final implementation and testing phase of its information systems for year compliance 
this phase is expected to be completed by the end of september products 
the company has assessed the capabilities of all of its products sold to customers 
based on the assessments made to date  none of the company s products are affected by year issues 
operations and infrastructure 
office equipment and other items used in the operations and facilities of the company are currently in the final implementation and testing phase for year compliance 
this phase is expected to be completed by the end of september suppliers 
the company has evaluated its supplier base to determine whether year issues affecting suppliers will adversely impact the company s operations 
the company has contacted all of its suppliers to assess their year readiness and will continue to monitor the progress of its key suppliers 
the company has assessed its key suppliers for year readiness and has not found any year issues from suppliers which would adversely impact the company s operations 
general and risk factors 
the company believes that its greatest potential risks are associated with its information systems and systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure 
the company is in the final stages of implementation for all its information systems  operations and infrastructure  but cannot predict whether significant problems will be identified 
the company has not yet determined the extent of contingency planning that may be required 
based on the status of the assessment made and remediation plans developed to date  the company is not in a position to state the total cost of remediation of all year issues 
costs identified to date are expected to be not less than most likely consequences of year issues 
we expect to identify and resolve all year issues that could materially adversely affect our business operations 
however  we believe that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year issues affecting us have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply to numerous 
in addition  no one can accurately predict how many year issues related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
as a result  we believe that the following consequences are possible a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for us  our contract manufacturers and our customers that will divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from ordinary business activities  several business disputes and claims for pricing adjustments or penalties due to year issues by our customers  which we believe will be resolved in the ordinary course of business  and a few serious business disputes alleging that we failed to comply with the terms of contracts or industry standards of performance  some of which could result in litigation or contract termination 
disclaimer 
the discussion of our efforts and expectations relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
our ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely affected by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  third party suppliers ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review
