net revenues 
net revenues in fiscal year decreased  or  versus net revenues in fiscal year all categories of revenue declined in the current fiscal year relative to the preceding fiscal year 
net revenues consist of license revenue  research and development fees and services revenue 
license revenue in fiscal year decreased  or  in comparison with the previous fiscal year 
the company recognized license revenue from three primary types of transactions in each period 
during fiscal  revenues from the restructure or termination of existing license agreements totaled  versus  during the previous fiscal year 
in fiscal year this revenue resulted from an agreement with a single oem customer while agreements with three different oem customers were restructured or terminated in fiscal year at the time of these agreements  the company either agreed to accept one time settlement payments in lieu of its right to all or a portion of future royalties or the company was able to recognize the non refundable portion of prepaid royalty deposits it had already received 
during fiscal  revenues from the sale of source code developed by the company were  versus  for the previous fiscal year 
the remainder of the company s license revenue is the result of royalties and to a lesser extent  technology license fees  resulting from the use of the company s technology in units sold by its oem customers 
such revenue was reduced to  in fiscal year versus  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the restructure and termination agreements discussed above which changed the terms of the company s compensation agreements with those oem customers 
revenues associated with licenses of source code  technology license fees  or any change to the terms of license agreements resulting from termination  amendment  or restructuring  are non recurring and are therefore not indicative of revenues to be recognized in future periods 
further  the company s realization of anticipated license and royalty revenue from oem customers is inherently uncertain due to potential delays and risks in the commercial release and acceptance of new products 
revenue related to research and development fees decreased  or  during fiscal year  in comparison with fiscal year research and development fees represent amounts received for non recurring engineering services as well as amounts received pursuant to contracts with oem customers under which the company is reimbursed for a portion of its development costs related to specific products up to the amounts specified in the contracts 
the company is typically paid by the oem customer as certain project milestones are achieved 
revenue under these research and development arrangements is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the extent to which such revenue is reported can vary considerably among periods  depending upon the specific terms of the company s contracts with oem customers  the relative level of development effort devoted towards projects on which research and development fees are charged  the relative level of utilization of the company s development staff  and the fee rates negotiated with oem customers 
the substantial decrease in research and development fees during the year ended march   versus the prior year occurred because the company completed its development work on several major oem projects 
as work on these larger projects concluded  the company assigned development staff to smaller projects with reduced staffing requirements  some of which had lower reimbursement rates 
these reductions in contract requirements resulted in staffing reductions achieved through attrition and restructure directives 
in the latter half of fiscal  the company began providing some of its non recurring engineering services on a consulting basis rather than as oem research and development funded in connection with potential royalty or license agreements 
such services can be offered at relatively higher rates  but do not generally have the additional revenue potential provided by a royalty or license agreement 
additionally  the company settled a contract dispute with an oem customer during fiscal and under the percentage of completion method  the effect of this settlement was to lower the company s revenue and the corresponding accounts receivable in the current fiscal year by  service revenue for fiscal year represents amounts earned for the support and maintenance of software licensed by oem customers and fees earned in connection with software workshops sponsored by the company for the benefit of current and prospective oem licensees 
the decrease of  in service revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal year is a result of reduced support fees earned in connection with software licensed to oem customers 
net revenues in fiscal year increased  or  in comparison with fiscal year this increase was primarily due to growth in research and development fee revenue which more than offset declines in license revenue versus the previous year 
the substantial increase during fiscal year in research and development fees resulted from higher reimbursement levels specified in the company s contracts with oem licensees and because there were a greater number of projects in process for which such fees were charged 
the decline in license revenue in fiscal year was due to reduced volume of non recurring revenue transactions  including source code licenses and the termination or restructuring of oem license agreements  versus the prior year 
in addition  service revenue also increased in fiscal year versus the prior year due to additional fees earned in connection with software workshops offered by the company for the benefit of current and prospective oem clients
