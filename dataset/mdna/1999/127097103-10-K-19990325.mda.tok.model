item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the drilling program year  the company has plans to drill wells in the region 
at december   the company had approximately  net acres  including approximately  net developed acres 
at year end  the company had identified proved undeveloped drilling locations 
gas marketing the company is engaged in a wide array of marketing activities offering its customers long term  reliable supplies of natural gas 
utilizing its pipeline and storage facilities  gas procurement ability and transportation  and natural gas risk management expertise  the company provides a menu of services that includes gas supply and transportation management  short term and long term supply contracts  capacity brokering and risk management alternatives 
the marketing of natural gas has changed significantly as a result of ferc order order  which was issued by the federal energy regulatory commission in order required pipelines to unbundle their gas sales  storage and transportation services 
as a result  local distribution companies and end users separately contract these services from gas marketers and producers 
order has had the effect of creating greater competition in the industry while also providing the company the opportunity to serve broader markets 
since order was issued  there has been an increase in the number of third party producers that use the company to market their gas 
additionally  as a result of order  the company has experienced increased competition for markets which has placed pressure on the premiums it has received 
appalachian region the company s principal markets for its appalachian region natural gas are in the northeastern united states 
the company s marketing subsidiary  cabot oil gas marketing corporation  purchases the company s natural gas production in the appalachian region as well as production from local third party producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of natural gas for resale 
this marketing subsidiary sells natural gas to industrial customers  local distribution companies ldcs and gas marketers both on and off the company s pipeline and gathering system 
most of the company s natural gas sales volume in the appalachian region is being sold at market responsive prices under contracts with a term of one year or less 
of these short term sales  spot market sales are made under month to month contracts  while industrial and utility sales generally are made under year to year contracts 
approximately of appalachian production is sold on fixed price contracts which typically renew annually 
the company s appalachian natural gas production is generally sold at a higher realized price a premium compared to production from other producing regions due to its close proximity to eastern markets 
while year to year fluctuations in that premium are normal due to changes in market conditions  this premium has typically been in the range of to per mmbtu above the henry hub cash price throughout the s 
in  the premium averaged approximately per mmbtu 
ancillary to its exploration and production operations  the company operates a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems  made up of approximately  miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate pipeline systems and five ldcs 
the majority of the company s pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the ferc 
as such  the transportation rates and terms of service of the company s pipeline subsidiary  cranberry pipeline corporation  are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc 
the company s natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable the company to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines  ldcs and industrial end users 
control of its gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables the company to purchase  transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties 
in addition  the company can take part in development drilling operations without relying upon third parties to transport its natural gas while incurring only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to its system 
the company has two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia  with a combined working capacity of approximately bcf of natural gas 
the company uses these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales  while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year 
the storage fields also enable the company to periodically increase the volume of natural gas that it can deliver by more than above the volume that it could deliver solely from its production in the appalachian region 
the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with the company s producing operations 
western region the company s principal markets for western region natural gas are in the northwestern  midwestern  and northeastern united states 
the company s marketing subsidiary purchases all of the company s natural gas production in the western region 
the marketing subsidiary sells the natural gas to cogenerators  natural gas processors  ldcs  industrial customers and marketing companies 
currently  most of the company s natural gas production in the western region is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one year or less at market responsive prices 
approximately of the western region s production is sold under a year cogeneration contract with years remaining that escalates in price per year 
the western region properties are connected to the majority of the midwestern  northwestern  and gulf coast interstate and intrastate pipelines  affording the company access to multiple markets 
the company also produces and markets approximately  barrels a day of crude oil condensate in the western region at market responsive prices 
gulf coast region the company s principal markets for gulf coast region natural gas are in the industrialized gulf coast areas and the northeastern united states 
the company s marketing subsidiary purchases all of the company s natural gas production in the gulf coast region 
the marketing subsidiary sells the natural gas to intrastate pipelines  natural gas processors and marketing companies 
currently  all of the company s natural gas sales volumes in the gulf coast region are being sold at market responsive prices under contracts with terms of one to three years 
the gulf coast region properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries  affording the company access to multiple markets 
the company also produces and markets approximately  barrels a day of crude oil condensate in the gulf coast region at market responsive prices 
this amount includes volumes attributable to the december acquisition of southern louisiana properties from oryx energy company 
risk management in  the company used certain financial instruments  called derivatives  to manage price risks associated with its production and brokering activities 
the impact of these derivatives on the company s financial results was not material 
while there are many different types of derivatives available  the company used natural gas price swap agreements price swaps to attempt to manage price risk more effectively and improve the company s realized natural gas prices 
these price swaps call for payments to or to receive payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and a variable gas price 
the company will continue to evaluate the benefit of this strategy in the future 
see the overview section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
reserves current reserves the following table sets forth information regarding the company s estimates of its net proved reserves at december  natural gas mmcf liquids mbbl total mmcfe developed undeveloped total developed undeveloped total developed undeveloped total appalachia       west         gulf coast          total          liquids include crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids ngl 
natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of mcf of natural gas to bbl of crude oil  condensate or natural gas liquids 
the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by the company s petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents  ltd  independent petroleum engineers 
for additional information regarding the company s estimates of proved reserves  the review of such estimates by miller and lents  ltd  and other information about the company s oil and gas reserves  see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item a copy of the review letter by miller and lents  ltd  has been filed as an exhibit to this form k 
the company s estimates of proved reserves in the table above do not differ materially from those filed by the company with other federal agencies 
the company s reserves are sensitive to natural gas sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates 
the company s reserves are based on oil and gas prices in effect for december there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company and  therefore  the reserve information in this form k represents only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers often vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties owned by the company declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent the company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities or both  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced

competition competition in the company s primary producing areas is intense 
competition is affected by price  contract terms  and quality of service  including pipeline connection times  distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record 
the company believes that its extensive acreage position and existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields give it a competitive advantage over certain other producers in the appalachian region which do not have such systems or facilities in place 
the company believes that its competitive position in the appalachian region is enhanced by the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas companies 
the company also actively competes against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources  particularly in the western and gulf coast regions 
the company believes that marketing its own gas through the operation of cabot oil gas marketing corporation enhances its competitive position 
other business matters major customer the company had no sales to any customer that exceeded of the company s total gross revenues in or seasonality demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal  with peak demand and typically higher prices during the colder winter months 
regulation of oil and natural gas production the company s oil and gas production and transportation activities are subject to federal  state and local regulations 
these regulations are not only statutory  but include rules and regulations issued by numerous governmental departments and agencies 
because these statutes  rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended  expanded and reinterpreted  the company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and  consequently  affects its profitability 
the company  however  does not believe it is affected materially differently by these regulations than others in the industry 
exploration and production the exploration and production operations of the company are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells  maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
the company s operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells  and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which the company can drill 
natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas produced by the company and the manner in which such production is transported and marketed 
under the natural gas act of  the federal energy regulatory commission regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas 
the ferc s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales was substantially modified by the natural gas policy act  under which the ferc continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in first sales in interstate and intrastate commerce 
effective january   however  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  including all sales by the company of its own production 
as a result  all of the company s produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts which may be in effect 
the ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation was not affected by the decontrol act 
the company s natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation 
beginning in  the ferc adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by  among other things  transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesaler marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters 
all gas marketing by the pipelines was required to be divested to a marketing affiliate  which operates separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants 
as a result of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late s and the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid s  the interstate pipelines are now required to provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation related services to all producers  gas marketing companies  local distribution companies  industrial end users and other customers seeking service 
through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services  the ferc expanded the impact of open access regulations to intrastate commerce 
more recently  the ferc has pursued other policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing 
most notable are i the large scale divestiture of interstate pipeline owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non affiliated companies  ii further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates  iii the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis  iv further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market and v development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market based rates rather than traditional cost of service based rates for transportation or transportation related services upon the pipeline s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market 
it remains to be seen what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets  the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties 
the company believes these changes generally have improved the company s access to markets while  at the same time  substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
the company cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on the company s activities 
in the past  congress has been very active in the area of gas regulation 
however  as discussed above  the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation and the promotion of competition in the gas industry 
thus  in addition to first sale deregulation  congress also repealed incremental pricing requirements and gas use restraints previously applicable 
there are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures which  if enacted  would significantly affect the petroleum industry 
at the present time  it is impossible to predict what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect  if any  such proposals might have on the company 
similarly  and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry  whether or to what extent that trend will continue  or what the ultimate effect will be on the company s sales of gas  cannot be predicted 
the company s pipeline systems and storage fields are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation  the west virginia public service commission  and the pennsylvania department of natural resources 
the company s pipeline systems in each state operate independently and are not interconnected 
environmental regulations general 
the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
permits are required for the operation of various company facilities 
these permits can be revoked  modified or renewed by issuing authorities 
governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations  with violations subject to fines  injunctions or both 
such government regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  installing and operating oil and gas facilities 
in most cases  the regulatory requirements impose water and air pollution control measures 
although the company believes that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company  risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations 
no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
also  it is possible that other developments  such as stricter environmental laws and regulations  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production would result in substantial costs and liabilities to the company 
solid and hazardous waste 
the company currently owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  numerous properties used for the production of oil and gas for many years 
although the company utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the company 
in addition  many of the properties were operated by third parties 
the company had no control over other parties treatment of hydrocarbons or other solid wastes and the way such substances may have been disposed or released 
state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under these new laws  the company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
the company generates some wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes 
it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes  and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance found at a site 
cercla also authorizes the epa  and in some cases  third parties  to respond to threats to the public health or the environment 
the epa and third parties are also authorized to try to recover the costs of such action from the responsible parties 
in the course of business  the company has generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of hazardous substances 
the company may also be an owner of sites on which hazardous substances have been released 
as a result  the company may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed 
oil pollution act 
the oil pollution act of the opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of terms on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies  including wetlands and intermittent streams 
the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
clean water act 
the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean water act and resulting regulations also govern discharge of certain contaminants to waters of the united states 
sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act requirements are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies  but regulatory agencies could require the company to cease construction or operation of certain sources of water discharges 
the company believes that it complies with the clean water act and implementing federal and state regulations in all material respects 
air emissions 
the company s operations are subject to local  state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution 
payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits 
regulatory agencies could also require the company to cease construction or operation of certain air emission sources 
the company believes that it substantially complies with the emission standards under local  state  and federal laws and regulations 
employees the company had active employees as of december  the company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory 
the company has not entered into any collective bargaining agreements with its employees 
in january  the company instituted a reorganization plan that resulted in a reduction in the number of active employees 
other the company s profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond its control  such as natural gas and crude oil prices 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves a variety of risks  including the risk of experiencing certain operating hazards such as fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  oil spills  and encountering formations with abnormal pressures  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company 
the company conducts operations in shallow offshore areas  which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations  such as capsizing  collision and damage from severe weather 
the company s operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves certain risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the proximity of pipelines to populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could exacerbate such risks 
at december   the company owned or operated approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems 
as part of its normal maintenance program  the company has identified certain segments of its pipelines which may require repair  replacement or additional maintenance 
according to customary industry practices  the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of these risks 
item properties see item business 
item legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are defendants or parties in numerous lawsuits or other governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company is also involved in various gas contract issues 
in the opinion of the company  final judgments or settlements  if any  which may be awarded in connection with any one or more of these suits and claims could be significant to the results of operations and cash flows of any period but would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere 
the company operates in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and exploitation 
in previous years  the company operated as two regions the appalachian region and the western region  which included the anadarko  rocky mountains and gulf coast areas 
beginning in  a third region was created with the formation of the gulf coast region  leaving the anadarko and rocky mountains areas in the western region 
for purposes of the comparisons below  prior period results have been restated to conform to the new three region structure 
overview despite the low commodity prices realized throughout the energy industry this year  the company reported earnings of per share  or million 
the decline in results from the record earnings and operating cash flow reported in was due largely to a per mcf decline in realized natural gas prices caused mainly by unseasonably warm temperatures for much of the united states in operating results for included the following o the average produced natural gas price was per mcf  down compared to  resulting in a million decrease in produced natural gas revenue 
natural gas production was up bcf  or  compared to  resulting in a million increase to revenue 
in addition  the average realized oil price was per bbl  down from  resulting in a million reduction to oil revenue 
the volume of oil sales was up mbbls  resulting in an increase to oil revenue of million from o brokered natural gas margin increased million as a result of an increase in volume of bcf 
o in an effort to provide future growth opportunities  the company increased its exploration spending by million  or  over the company expanded its seismic program and added to its exploration staff 
higher dry hole cost also contributed to this increase 
o in december  the company recognized a million reorganization charge 
the reorganization involved the reduction of employment levels by  and is expected to result in future annual savings of million 
the income statement reflects the components of this charge in the line items that will show the benefit in future years 
direct operating expense related to the reorganization charge was million  the exploration charge was million  and million was recognized in general and administrative 
o in december  the company purchased producing oil and gas properties and other assets located in southern louisiana from oryx energy company for million the southern louisiana properties 
these southern louisiana properties include interests in ten fields covering  net acres with producing wells 
the acquisition also included a d seismic inventory 
proved reserves acquired were approximately bcfe 
due to the timing of the purchase  the impact on production was not significant  adding mmcfe to december s daily production rate 
the company plans to increase production by reworking certain non producing wells  and commencing an exploratory and development drilling program 
operating cash flows were million  down million  or  from s record level 
the significant reduction in commodity prices was the primary factor in the lower net cash flow level realized in operating cash flows  in combination with the increase in borrowings from the revolving credit facility  funded the million capital and expenditure program  including the million acquisition of oil and gas properties located in southern louisiana from oryx energy company in december the company drilled net wells with a net success rate of compared to net wells and a net success rate in the company replaced of production through drilling additions and revisions  versus a production replacement in reserve replacement from all sources in was  compared to in in  the company plans to drill gross wells net and spend million in capital and exploration expenditures  down from spending in reaction to continued low energy commodity price expectations 
price volatility in the gas market remains prevalent as it has over the past few years and management cannot predict natural gas price levels for the remainder of and beyond 
consequently  the company will adjust  when necessary  its spending plan in accordance with material changes in  among other things  realized natural gas prices and discretionary cash flows 
total equivalent production was bcfe  an increase of over the company s drilling program in the gulf coast region experienced some mechanical failures resulting in redrills as well as drilling difficulties causing production to be bcfe lower than expected 
certain of these wells commenced production later than anticipated in or will come on line in the company s strategic pursuits are sensitive to energy commodity prices  particularly the price of natural gas 
the unseasonably lower natural gas prices that were seen at the close of have remained soft through most of the winter period 
despite a spring that brought improved seasonal prices  the balance of saw prices well below those of the most recent preceding years 
the unseasonably mild winter throughout much of the country has kept prices low into the company remains focused on its strategies to grow through the drill bit  through acquisitions and through greater emphasis on marketing 
additionally  the company will continue to capitalize on the opportunities its expanded exploration efforts have provided 
the company believes that these strategies remain appropriate in the current industry environment and establish a firm base that will enable the company to create shareholder value over the long term 
the success of these strategies is measured by the achievement of three goals 
the first of these goals is to increase cash flow from both increased production and reduced costs 
although production increased only slightly from  the newly acquired gulf coast properties are expected to boost production by approximately bcfe 
the benefits of the reorganization will help to lower costs in and beyond 
the second goal is to maintain reserves per share while increasing production to protect long term shareholder value 
excluding revisions  reserve additions from the drilling program replaced of production 
additionally  the company acquired reserves during the year through asset purchases 
most significantly  the company purchased approximately bcfe of proved reserves from oryx energy company in december as a result  the total proved reserve levels increased in to tcfe  the highest level in the company s history 
finally  the company strives to reduce debt as a percentage of total capitalization debt to capital percentage without diluting shareholder value 
however  the acquisition of growth oriented opportunities such as the december southern louisiana properties acquisition  along with the partial funding of the drilling program  increased the company s debt  resulting in an increase in the debt to capital percentage from in to in while the debt to capital percentage has increased  the company s debt to discretionary cash flow ratio is x compared to the reserve life index years  calculated as year end reserves divided by annual production 
these debt to discretionary cash flow and reserve life index amounts have been normalized to exclude the impact of the southern louisiana properties acquisition since the million of related debt incurred is disproportionate to the one month of discretionary cash flows from these acquired properties 
excluding the normalization  debt to discretionary cash flow is x and the reserve life ratio is for a three year comparison  refer to the table on page the preceding paragraphs  discussing the company s strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
see forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity the company s capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from its oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by its oil and gas reserves 
the company s level of earnings and cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and its ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for oil and gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
however  unseasonably warm temperatures remained into the winter of  bringing with it the continuation of lower energy commodity prices 
natural gas prices were generally down in compared to  resulting in lower operating cash flows than in the previous year 
the primary sources of cash for the company during were from funds generated from operations and increased borrowings on the revolving line of credit 
primary uses of cash were funds used in operations  exploration and development expenditures  acquisitions including million for the purchase of the southern louisiana properties from oryx energy company  dividends on preferred and common stock and repayment of debt 
the company had a net cash inflow of million in net cash inflow from operating and financing activities totaled million  funding the capital and exploration expenditures of million  net of the million in net proceeds from the sale of assets 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were million lower than in due predominantly to lower natural gas and oil prices  partially offset by a significant increase in the accounts payable balance resulting mainly from higher fourth quarter drilling expenditures 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were substantially higher  increasing million over  due primarily to higher natural gas prices and production  and a significant reduction in trade receivables 
in millions cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in were million higher than in due primarily to the capital and exploration expenditures that increased million over  and in part to million in net proceeds from the meadville sale in these expenditures included the million purchase of the southern louisiana properties from oryx energy company in december  the million spent as part of the joint exploration agreement with union pacific resources group  inc upr  and the million used to acquire bcfe of proved reserves in the anadarko and rocky mountains areas of the western region 
cash flows used by investing activities in were million lower than in due to net proceeds of million received from the meadville green river property transaction  partially offset by the expenses of the stronger drilling program 
in millions cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities in were increases in borrowings on the revolving credit facility related to the drilling program and million in property acquisitions 
financing activities in also included the payment of stock dividends and the purchase of treasury stock 
cash flows used by financing activities from consist primarily of the million net reduction in borrowings on the revolving credit facility as well as dividend payments 
the activity was mostly attributable to dividend payments  but also included a reduction in debt under the credit facility 
the company s available credit line under the revolving credit facility was million from june until november in november  the company issued million in notes see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and reduced the available credit line to million 
in december  the revolving credit facility was increased to include five additional banks 
the new agreement gives the company the ability to borrow up to million in addition to its other long term debt 
the company s outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility was million at december  the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the projected present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
accordingly  oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation 
oil and gas prices also effect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance 
while the company does not currently believe that its credit availability is likely to be significantly reduced  management cannot predict how current price levels may change the banks long term price outlook and  therefore  can give no assurance that the company s available credit line will not be adversely impacted in or as to the amount of credit that will continue to be available under this facility 
to reduce the impact of such a redetermination  the company strives to manage its debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
at year end  this excess capacity totaled million  or of the total available credit line 
see note debt and credit agreements for further discussion 
in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings  the company has a period of days to reduce its outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line 
the revolving credit agreement also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the adjusted credit line within the first days of such an adjustment 
the company s interest expense is projected to be approximately million 
a principal payment of million on the private placement of senior notes is due in the second quarter of capitalization information on the company is as follows in millions long term debt current portion of long term debt total debt stockholders equity common stock net of treasury preferred stock total equity total capitalization debt to capitalization the company s debt  discretionary cash flow and reserve life index are comprised as follows in millions total debt discretionary cash flow dcf debt to dcf coverage x x x reserve life index in years discretionary cash flow is defined as net income plus non cash charges and exploration expense less preferred dividends 
excludes net proceeds on property sales 
reserve life index is year end reserves divided by annual production 
the debt to dcf coverage ratio was normalized to exclude the impact of the december southern louisiana properties acquisition since the ratio was disproportionately impacted by the full inclusion of the million in related debt incurred compared to the one month of discretionary cash flows from these acquired properties 
before the normalization  debt to dcf coverage is x 
amount normalized to exclude the reserves purchased in the december southern louisiana properties acquisition 
including these reserves  the reserve life index is gas price swaps from time to time  the company enters into natural gas swap agreements price swaps  a type of derivative instrument  with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of the company s production 
under these price swaps  the company receives a fixed price fixed price swaps on a notional quantity of natural gas in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas futures 
notional quantities of natural gas are used in each price swap  since no physical exchange or delivery of natural gas is involved 
during and  the company entered into no fixed price swaps to hedge natural gas prices on its production 
in  the prices received on fixed price swaps ranged from to per mmbtu on total notional quantities of  mmbtu  representing of production 
in addition  the company uses price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered transactions 
typically  the company enters into contracts to broker natural gas at a variable price based on the market index price 
however  in some circumstances  some of the company s customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the contract 
after entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of its customers or suppliers  the company may use price swaps to effectively convert these fixed price contracts to market sensitive price contracts 
these price swaps are held by the company to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes 
during  the company entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of  mmbtu related to its brokered activities  representing less than of the company s total volume of brokered natural gas sold 
a pre tax loss of million was recorded from these price swaps in in and  these price swaps had total notional quantities of  mmbtu and  mmbtu related to brokered transactions  and represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total volume of brokered natural gas sold 
at december   the company had open price swaps with notional quantities of  mmbtu and an unrealized loss of million on these open contracts 
see note financial instruments for further discussion 
the company is exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices for natural gas 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the natural gas that is hedged 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires all derivatives to be recognized in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of sfas this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of the provisions from sfas on its financial position or operations 
at december   the company had entered into natural gas price swap contracts that remain open at year end as follows swap purchases volume in weighted average period mmbtu contract price full year  st quarter  year many computer systems have been built using software that processes transactions using two digits to represent the year 
this type of software will generally require modifications to function properly with dates after december  the same issue applies to microprocessors embedded in machinery and equipment  such as gas compressors and pipeline meters 
the impact of failing to identify and correct this problem could be significant to the company s ability to operate and report results  as well as potentially exposing the company to third party liability 
the company has begun making necessary modifications to its computer systems and embedded microprocessors in preparation for the year these projects are on schedule and the company believes that the total related costs will be approximately million  funded by cash from operations or short term borrowings  when completed in of the total cost  million is attributable to the purchase of new software and equipment which will be capitalized 
the remaining million is being expensed over and  and will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
actual costs through were million  million of which has been capitalized and million of which has been expensed 
the company has begun reviewing the compliance of field equipment including compressor stations  gas control systems and data logging equipment 
most equipment reviewed was found to be compliant  and  where necessary  microprocessor chip replacements are scheduled to be complete in the first quarter of at a cost less than million 
additionally  the company is in the process of contacting its significant customers and suppliers in order to determine the company s exposure to their potential failure to become year compliant 
although the company is not aware of any year compliance problems with any of its customers or suppliers  there can be no guarantee that the systems of these companies will operate without interruption in the new millennium 
the company has formed an internal committee to not only identify and respond to these issues  but also to develop a contingency plan in the event that a problem arises after the turn of the century 
management expects the contingency plan to be substantially complete by mid additionally  the company has engaged outside consultants to review the company s plans and periodically update the status of the plan implementation 
at this time  the company does not anticipate that the arrival of the year will materially impact its financial position or results of operations 
the project costs and timetable for year compliance are based on management s best estimates 
in developing these estimates  assumptions were made regarding future events including  among other things  the availability of certain resources and the continued cooperation of the company s customers and suppliers 
actual costs and timing may differ from management s estimates due to unexpected difficulties in obtaining trained personnel  locating and correcting relevant computer code and other factors 
capital and exploration expenditures the following table lists capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions werco acquisition exploration expenses total an adjustment to the million non cash component relating to deferred taxes for the difference between the tax and book bases of the acquired properties  as required by sfas  accounting for income taxes  of the washington energy resources company werco acquisition as a result of the million valuation adjustment received in includes million in oil and gas properties acquired from equitable resources energy company in a like kind exchange transaction with a portion of the assets sold in the meadville property sale 
includes million in oil and gas properties acquired from oryx energy company in december the company generally funds its capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations 
the company budgets such capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows  exclusive of acquisitions 
planned expenditures for have been reduced compared with  excluding proved property acquisitions 
the company intends to review and adjust the capital and exploration expenditures planned for as industry conditions dictate 
currently  the company projects million in capital and exploration expenditures for  including million for the drilling and exploration program 
the company plans to drill wells net  compared with wells net drilled in in addition to the drilling and exploration program  other capital expenditures are planned primarily for lease acquisitions and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction 
during  dividends were paid on the company s common stock totaling million and on the convertible redeemable preferred stock totaling million 
the company has paid quarterly common stock dividends of per share since becoming publicly traded in the amount of future dividends is determined by the board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition  and capital requirements 
other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
the company generates tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sands formation tight gas sands amounts to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the appalachian region during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale is approximately per mmbtu in in and  the company completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in and approximately million over the remaining four years 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company has benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference cannot reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
the company s operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
the company s ability to incur debt  to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock  and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  the company s revolving credit agreement and notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   the calculated ratio for was to in the unforeseen event that the company fails to comply with these covenants  it may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank  which  if granted  would allow the company a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in item capital resources and liquidity and note debt and credit agreements 
conclusion the company s financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and its ability to market its production on economically attractive terms 
the realized natural gas sales price decreased compared to  while production volumes increased less than 
as a result  the company experienced a lower level of earnings and operating cash flow than its record highs in price volatility in the gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years  as demonstrated most recently in the first and last quarters of and the beginning of  with monthly natural gas prices dropping to levels substantially below the prices of the corresponding months of the prior year 
given this continued price volatility  management cannot predict with certainty what pricing levels will be for the rest of and beyond 
because future cash flows and earnings are subject to such variables  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund its capital requirements if commodity prices should become substantially more depressed 
while the company s plans include approximately million in capital spending  the company will periodically assess industry conditions and will adjust its spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of its capital requirements  including  among other things  reductions in capital expenditures or common stock dividends 
the company believes its capital resources  supplemented  if necessary  with external financing  are adequate to meet its current capital requirements

results of operations for the purpose of reviewing the company s results of operations  net income is defined as net income available to common stockholders 
selected financial and operating data in millions except wehre specified net operating revenues operating expenses interest expense net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted natural gas production bcf appalachia west gulf coast total company produced natural gas sales price mcf appalachia west gulf coast total company crude condensate volume mbbl price bbl and compared net income and revenues 
the company reported net income in of million  or per share  down million  or per share  compared to net operating revenue of million was down million  or from natural gas sales of million accounted for of net operating revenue in the decrease in net operating revenue was a result of a decline in realized natural gas prices and a reduction in realized oil prices 
operating income and net income were similarly impacted by the decrease in energy commodity prices along with higher expenses attributable to the company s increased exploration program 
natural gas production volumes were down bcf  or  to bcf in the appalachian region due to the september sale of producing properties located in northwest pennsylvania the meadville properties 
natural gas production volumes in the western region were up bcf  or  to bcf due to increases in rocky mountains area production 
this increase was a result of both the purchase of oil and gas producing properties located in the green river basin of wyoming the green river properties and new wells brought on line 
in the gulf coast region  natural gas production volumes were up bcf  or  to bcf due to results of the and drilling programs and in part to the december purchase of the southern louisiana properties 
while production increased over levels  the region did experience drilling delays and mechanical failures in a significant field that deferred production into  but left the field s total reserves substantially unchanged 
the average natural gas sales price decreased per mcf  or  to in the appalachian region  decreasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
in the western region  the average natural gas sales price decreased per mcf  or  to  decreasing net operating revenues by million on bcf of production 
the average natural gas sales price in the gulf coast region decreased per mcf  or  to  reducing net operating revenue by million on bcf of production 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price decreased per mcf  or  to 
crude oil and condensate sales increased by mbbl  or  increasing revenue by million over this increase was due to new production brought on line  combined with the december production of the newly acquired southern louisiana properties 
however  the average crude oil price declined  reducing oil revenue by million 
brokered natural gas margin was up million to million due to a volume increase over  combined with a per mcf increase in the net margin to per mcf 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  to million 
in december  the company recognized a million reorganization charge designed to reduce future operating expenses 
the reorganization charge was comprised of million in direct operating expense  million in exploration expense and million in general and administrative expense 
the reorganization reduced the number of company employees by 
the significant changes in operating expenses are explained as follows o direct operations expense increased million  or  due primarily to the million direct operations component of the reorganization charge in the fourth quarter and million in higher workover costs incurred primarily in the gulf coast region 
o exploration expense increased million  or  due to a million increase in geological and geophysical activity including seismic data purchases and consulting fees  a million increase in dry hole cost  resulting from the company s expanded drilling efforts in the gulf coast where wells are generally drilled at higher costs  a million increase in exploration personnel related expenses such as salaries  benefits  and relocation associated with the increase in the exploration program  and million for the exploration expense component of the reorganization that was expensed in december o depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense increased million  or  primarily due to the amortization of a lease option purchased in the second quarter of related to a joint venture with upr in the gulf coast region 
additionally  this expense increased in part due to higher units of production expense in connection with increased production 
o general and administrative expense increased million primarily due to million due to staffing increases in the third and fourth quarters of  million for non cash stock compensation for stock awards  million for certain executive retirement and severance packages accrued in  million due to higher relocation and travel expenses  and million that was recorded for the general and administrative component of the reorganization in december interest expense increased million  or  due to higher levels of debt outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
income tax expense was down million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax 
included in income tax expense is the interest charged by the internal revenue service on a deferred tax gain related to the monetization of the section credits 
this interest amount was million in and million in and compared net income and revenues 
the company reported net income in of million  or per share  up million  or per share  compared to  excluding the impact of an income tax refund 
the million income tax refund  or per share  in related to a million tax refund for percentage depletion claimed for certain periods prior to and million of interest income million after tax earned on the refund amount 
excluding these pre tax effects of the income tax refund  operating income and net operating revenues increased million and million  respectively 
natural gas sales comprised  or million  of net operating revenue in the increase in net operating revenue was a result of both an increase in the produced natural gas sales price and an increase in equivalent production 
operating income and net income were similarly impacted by the increases in natural gas prices and equivalent production along with lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and interest expense 
effective september   the company sold the meadville properties for million to lomak petroleum incorporated now known as range resources corporation 
the properties sold included wells  producing approximately mmcfe net per day primarily from the medina formation 
a portion of these assets were replaced  in a like kind exchange transaction  with the green river properties purchased for million in a transaction with equitable resources energy company which closed on october  the purchased properties added an estimated bcfe of reserves  interests in wells with estimated daily net production of mmcfe and potential drilling locations to the western region 
this acquisition increased the company s presence in the rocky mountains area by 
natural gas production volumes were down bcf  or  to bcf in the appalachian region as a result of the september sale of the meadville properties which were estimated to have produced bcfe in after the sale 
natural gas production volumes were up bcf  or  to bcf in the western region due largely to new production from wells drilled and put on line in the rocky mountains area during the last half of and in  and from the acquired green river properties which produced bcfe 
natural gas production volumes were up bcf  or  to bcf in the gulf coast region due largely to new production from wells drilled and put on line during the last half of and in in the appalachian region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
the average western region natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
in the gulf coast region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to 
crude oil and condensate sales increased by mbbl  or  primarily due to new production brought on by the higher rate of drilling activity in and compared to levels 
brokered natural gas margin was down million to million due primarily to a per mcf decrease in the net margin to per mcf and in part to a brokered volume decrease of from operating expenses 
the total operating expenses increased million  or  to million 
the significant changes are explained as follows o direct operation expense increased million  or  due to office consolidation costs in the western region and the increase in equivalent production 
direct operating costs per mcfe declined  however  from to due in part to the sale of the higher cost meadville properties and the addition of new lower cost production 
o exploration expense increased million primarily due to a million rise in geological and geophysical expenses and a million increase in contract labor services related to the increased drilling and exploration program in o depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense decreased million  or  due to the benefit of the meadville green river like kind exchange transaction in the third quarter and due to the decline in the western region dd a rate related to the addition of new lower cost production to existing fields 
o taxes other than income increased million  or  due to the increase in natural gas production revenues 
o general and administrative expense increased million  or  due primarily to higher incentive and stock compensation expenses related to the company s marked improvement in earnings performance 
interest expense  excluding the income tax refund  declined million  or  due to a reduction in the company s long term debt level 
income tax expense  excluding the million refund  was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax 
the company s effective tax rate declined slightly due to a reduction in the effective state tax rate combined with a million refund received on the prior year percentage depletion claim
