item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s operating results and financial condition reflect the growth of the company s real estate finance  equipment leasing and energy businesses following substantial increases in working capital due to the sale  in december  of common stock from which it received net proceeds of million  the issuance  in july  of million of notes from which it received net proceeds of million  and the sale  in april  of common stock from which it received net proceeds of million 
these transactions along with the acquisition of the atlas group in september  jla credit in february and viking resources in august were primarily responsible for increasing the company s capital stockholders equity plus total debt to million as of september  from million at september  from million at september  overview of fiscal the company s gross revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal  as compared to an increase in fiscal of million from million in fiscal the revenues from the company s real estate finance business decreased to million  a decrease of million from million in fiscal  as compared to an increase of million in fiscal from million in fiscal leasing revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal as compared to an increase of million from million in fiscal in addition  energy revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal as compared to an increase of million from million in fiscal during the past three fiscal years  the company s revenues  expressed as a percentage of its total revenues  were distributed across its industry segments as follows years ended september  real estate finance equipment leasing energy the balance in  in and in is attributable to corporate assets not allocated to a specific industry segment  including cash and the common shares held in resource asset 
the company anticipates that its energy revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  will increase in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of viking resources 
as of september   total assets were million an increase of million from assets of million at september   as compared to an increase of million from assets of million at september  during the past three fiscal years  the company s assets  expressed as a percentage of its total assets  were distributed across its industry segments as follows years ended september  real estate finance equipment leasing energy the balance in  in and in is attributable to corporate assets not attributable to a specific industry segment  as referred to above 
results of operations real estate finance as a result of its increased resources  the company has acquired loans in recent years and particularly following fiscal much larger than those it previously acquired both as to the outstanding loan balance and the amount of its net investment 
prior to fiscal  the company had focused on acquiring loans with outstanding receivable balances of between million and million  with investment costs invested funds before proceeds from refinancings or sales of senior lien interests typically between million and million 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company acquired four loans and originated one loan for a cost of million 
for loans acquired during this period  the average contractual receivable balance was million  the average investment cost was million and the receivable balances ranged from million to million 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company acquired loans for a cost of million 
for loans acquired during this period  the average outstanding receivable balance was million  the average investment cost was million and the receivable balances ranged from million to million 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company acquired loans for a cost of million 
for loans acquired during this period  the average outstanding receivable balance was million  the average investment cost was million and the loans acquired had outstanding receivable balances ranging from  to million 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the revenue recognized and cost and expenses incurred in the company s commercial real estate finance operations during the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands revenue interest    accreted discount    fees    gains on sales of senior lien interests and loans    loan payments in excess of carrying value  net rental income cost and expenses    year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution operations decreased million to million in the year ended september  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in gains from sales of senior lien interests and loans 
the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of loans sold or loans in which senior lien interests were sold from loans in the fiscal year ended september  to two loans in the fiscal year ended september  prior to january   most of the transactions in which senior lien interests were created were structured to meet the criteria under generally accepted accounting principles for sales of those interests to the senior lienors 
effective january   the company made a strategic decision to structure future transactions as financings rather than as sales  thereby retaining the entire principal amount of its commercial mortgage loans originated on its balance sheet 
thus  for most transactions that were completed prior to january  including the two loans sold in fiscal  referred to above  the company recorded a gain on sale which is included in the company s revenues  refinancing proceeds received subsequent to that date are not recordable as revenues under generally accepted accounting principles 
despite the decrease in revenues resulting from the foregoing change  the cash flows available to the company from its financing transactions  which were generally based on the appraised value and the cash flows of the property underlying the company s commercial mortgage loans  are unaffected by these modifications 
the primary effect of this change in policy is a shift from the recognition of an immediate gain upon the sale of a senior lien interest in a commercial mortgage loan receivable to the recognition of interest income over the life of the loan receivable 
the decrease in gain on sale revenues was partially offset by the following i an increase of million in interest income including an increase of million of accretion of discount of which million resulted from the repayment in june of a mortgage loan secured by a property located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the payment  which was made pursuant to the terms of an existing loan restructuring agreement  was comprised of million in cash plus a interest in the property securing the mortgage loan 
the property interest includes significant cash flow preferences in the underlying cash flows from the property 
because the amount received in repayment of the loan and anticipated to be received from the property interest exceeds the amount of discounted cash flows previously estimated in determining the company s accretion of discount on the loan  the company revised its estimates in determining the accreted discount on this loan and recognized million of accretion to reflect the fair value of the property interest 
the company records the property interest as an investment in real estate ventures and  accordingly  no accretion of discount was recognized with respect to it after june in addition  two loans acquired at the end of fiscal contributed million in total interest income in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the book value of loans outstanding during the current year increased to million as compared to million in the prior fiscal year  further increasing accretion of discount income 
ii an increase in million in loan payments in excess of carrying value of which million resulted from the june mortgage loan repayment referred to in i 
as a consequence of the foregoing  the company s yield gross commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution revenues  including gains resulting from refinancings  sales of loans and sales of senior lien interests in loans  divided by the book value of average loan balances decreased to in the year ended september  as compared to in the year ended september  costs and expenses of the company s commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution operations increased million to million in the year ended september  the increase was primarily a result of hiring additional personnel  increased compensation to existing employees and legal costs relating to management of the company s portfolio 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s revenues less costs and expenses from commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution operations decreased to million in the year ended september   as compared to million in the same period in the prior year 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution operations increased million to million in the year ended september  the increase was attributable to the following i an increase of million in interest income including an increase of million of accretion of discount resulting from an increase of million in the book value of loans outstanding during that period to million as compared to million for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
ii an increase of million in gains from refinancings  sales of senior lien interests and sales of loans 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of loans sold or loans in which senior lien interests were sold from eight loans totaling million in the year ended september  to loans totaling million in the year ended september  
these sales included  during the second quarter of fiscal  a sale to resource asset of mortgage loans and senior lien interests in two other loans  resulting in proceeds of million and a gain of million 
in addition  during fiscal  the company sold senior lien interests in three other loans to resource asset  resulting in proceeds of million and a gain of million 
iii an increase of million in fee income to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  fees received in the year ended september  consisted of the following  for financial advisory and consultation services related to the organization and capitalization of resource asset  million for services to borrowers whose loans the company later acquired of these fees   was paid by a partnership whose partners are resource asset and brandywine construction and management  and a one time fee of  for services rendered to an existing borrower in connection with the operation  leasing and supervision of the collateral securing the company s loan 
as a consequence of the foregoing  the company s yield gross commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution revenues  including gains resulting from refinancings  sales of loans and sales of senior lien interests in loans  divided by the book value of average loan balances increased to in the year ended september  as compared to in the year ended september  costs and expenses of the company s commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution operations increased  to million in the year ended september  the increase was primarily a result of hiring additional personnel  increased compensation to existing employees and legal costs associated with the expansion of this operation 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s gross profit from commercial mortgage loan acquisition and resolution operations increased to million in the year ended september   as compared to million in the same period in the prior year 
results of operations equipment leasing the following table sets forth certain information relating to the revenue recognized costs and expenses incurred in the company s equipment leasing operations during the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands revenues small ticket leasing interest and fees    gains on sale of leases    partnership management    lease finance placement and advisory services costs and expenses small ticket leasing    partnership management    lease finance placement and advisory services year ended september  compared to year ended september  the company experienced continued growth in its leasing business during fiscal  originating  leases having a cost of million  as compared to  leases having a cost of million during the prior year 
this growth was further accelerated by the jla credit acquisition on february  the results of operations of jla credit are included in the company s consolidated results of operations from february  gains on sale of leases decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million because  through march   the company structured a substantial part of its lease financing transactions  other than warehouse revolving lines of credit and certain financings relating to jla credit  to meet the criteria for treatment as sales under generally accepted accounting principles 
thus  for all such transactions completed through that date  the company recorded gains on sales and terminations 
on april   the company elected to alter the structure of its future securitizations to retain leases that it securitizes as investments on its balance sheet and record the related securitization indebtedness on its balance sheet as debt for accounting purposes 
the company also modified its existing million commercial paper conduit facility so that it would retain leases as investments and record related securitization indebtedness as debt on its balance sheet 
the primary effect of the change in securitization structure and the modification of its commercial paper conduit facility is that the company will recognize income over the lives of the lease receivables it securitizes or under its commercial paper conduit facility rather than recognize an immediate gain upon the sale of the lease receivables 
the company s cash flow  which is influenced by the advance rates and discount rates provided for by the commercial paper conduit facilities  was unaffected by these modifications 
the company currently has two sales facilities  one with ibm credit and one with ibm canada  that relate to equipment leases generated through those companies 
as a result of the requirements of ibm credit and ibm canada  these facilities continue to be structured in a way that requires the company to treat transactions under the facilities as sales for accounting purposes 
all leases generated through ibm credit and ibm canada must be sold to these facilities 
interest and fee income totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal  of which million was attributable to jla credit and the balance to the increase in lease originations 
during the quarter ended june   the company began to retain for its own account the residual interests of leases sold 
prior to this quarter  the company had sold its residual interests  primarily for promissory notes aggregating million at september  
the company anticipates that it will continue to retain residual interests for its own account  however  there is no established company policy as to the retention or sale of residuals and  accordingly  the company may determine to sell residuals in the future 
the effect of retaining residuals is to reduce revenues recognized from the sale of leases at the time of sale while increasing revenues anticipated to be derived in the future from the realization of residuals 
at september   estimated unrealized residuals approximated million 
equipment leasing costs and expenses increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of the acquisition of jla credit million and higher operating costs associated with the increase in lease originations 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  during fiscal  the company originated  leases having a cost of million  as compared to  leases having a cost of million during the prior year 
during that period  the company sold leases with a book value of approximately million in return for cash of million and notes with a face value of million  resulting in gains on sale of million  as compared to fiscal  in which the company sold leases with a book value of million in return for cash of million and a note with a face value of million  resulting in gains on sale of million 
payment on the notes is subject to the level of lease delinquencies and realization of residuals on the sold leases 
revenues from equipment leasing were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase in revenues for year ended september  as compared to the prior year was attributable to i an increase in the gain on sales of leases of million resulting from the increased number of leases originated and sold by the company and ii an increase in interest and fee income of million resulting from the increased volume of lease originations 
equipment leasing costs and expenses increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of higher operating costs associated with the increase in lease originations 
during the quarter ended june   the company began to retain for its own account the residual values of leases sold 
prior to this quarter the company had sold its residual interests  primarily for promissory notes 
these notes aggregated million in principal amount at september  at september   unrealized residuals were million 
results of operations energy on september  and august   the company acquired the atlas group and viking resources  respectively 
results of operations for the respective years of acquisition include the operations of these companies from their respective dates of acquisition and  accordingly  are not comparable to the similar periods of the prior years 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred  daily production volumes  average sales prices  production costs as a percentage of oil and gas sales  and production cost per equivalent unit in the company s energy and energy finance operations during the periods years ended september  in thousands revenues production    well drilling  well services    gain on sales of assets  costs and expenses exploration and production    well drilling  well services   years ended september  in thousands revenues gas    oil  production volumes gas thousands of cubic feet mcf day    oil barrels bbls day average sales price gas per mcf oil per bbl production costs as a percent of sales gas per mcf oil per bbl excludes sales of residual gas and sales to landowners 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  natural gas revenues increased million in fiscal  compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year  due to a increase in production volumes partially offset by an decrease in the average sales price of natural gas 
oil revenues increased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a increase in production volumes in fiscal both gas and oil volumes were favorably impacted by the acquisition of the atlas group at the end of fiscal and viking resources in august without the additions of the atlas group and viking resources  gas and oil revenues would have been million and  respectively  resulting in an overall decrease of  compared to average daily gas production volumes would have been  mcf  a decrease compared to the average sales price per mcf would have decreased to 
average daily oil production would have increased barrels over  offset by a decrease in the average sales price per barrel to 
well drilling revenues and expenses in fiscal represents the billing and costs associated with the completion of wells for partnerships sponsored by atlas america  which acquired the atlas group at the end of fiscal well services revenues and related costs increased significantly as a result of an increase in the number of wells operated due to the acquisition of the atlas group and viking resources 
production costs excluding exploration costs of  increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the acquisition of the interests in producing properties referred to above 
amortization of oil and gas property costs as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the variance from period to period was directly attributable to changes in the company s oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and fluctuations in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas 
years ended september  compared to year ended september  natural gas revenues increased  in fiscal  compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year  due to a increase in production volumes 
oil revenues decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a decrease in the average sales price of oil in fiscal the decrease was significantly offset by a increase in production volumes as compared to fiscal both gas and oil volumes were favorably impacted by two acquisitions of interests in an aggregate of wells located in ohio and new york  one in the third quarter of fiscal and the other in the first quarter of fiscal production costs excluding exploration costs of  increased  to million in the year ended september   as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the acquisition of the interests in producing properties referred to above and well workovers 
amortization of oil and gas property costs as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the variance from period to period was directly attributable to changes in the company s oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and fluctuations in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties 
results of operations other revenues  costs and expenses year ended september  compared to year ended september  interest and other income decreased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september   as a result of the following i the substantial decreases in the company s uncommitted cash balances and the temporary investment of such balances during the year decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal ii the reimbursement to the company  in the third quarter of fiscal  of payroll and administrative costs in the amount of  for services provided to a partnership in connection with the partnership s investment in an unrelated business in which the company s president is the president of the general partner 
there were no similar reimbursements in fiscal iii the above increases were partially offset by the receipt of dividend income of million from resource asset in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased  to million in the year ended september   as compared to million the year ended september   primarily as a result of the hiring of additional corporate staff and increases in the compensation of senior officers  together with an increase in occupancy costs as the company leased additional office space to accommodate its increased staff 
interest expense increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to million in the year ended september   primarily reflecting an increase in borrowings as a result of the acquisition of jla credit million and the election on april  by the company to alter the structure of its future securitizations to retain leases it securitizes as investments on its balance sheet and to record the related securitization indebtedness on its balance sheet as debt 
provision for possible losses increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to million in the year ended september  the increase was primarily the result of increases in the provision for possible losses relating to equipment leasing to million 
the increased provision reflects the increase in lease originations 
in establishing the company s allowance for possible losses in connection with its real estate finance and equipment leasing operations  the company considers among other things  the historic performance of the company s loan or lease portfolios  industry standards and experience regarding losses in similar loans or leases and payment history on specific loans and leases  as well as general economic conditions in the united states  in the borrower s or lessee s geographic area and in its specific industry 
the effective tax rate decreased to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  the fiscal decrease resulted from an increase in the generation of depletion for tax purposes due to the atlas acquisition and an increase in tax credits 
these increases in tax benefits were partially offset by an increase in state income taxes 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  interest and other income increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september   as a result of i the substantial increases in the company s uncommitted cash balances and the temporary investment of such balances during the year  ii the reimbursement to the company  in the third quarter of fiscal  of payroll and administrative costs in the amount of  for services provided to a partnership in connection with the partnership s investment in an unrelated business in which the company s president is the president of the general partner  and iii the recognition of dividend income of  from resource asset in fiscal  following its formation in january general and administrative expenses increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to million the year ended september   primarily as a result of the hiring of additional corporate staff and increases in the compensation of senior officers  together with an increase in occupancy costs as the company leased additional office space to accommodate its increased staff 
interest expense increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to million in the year ended september  primarily reflecting an increase in borrowings as a result of the july issuance of the notes which were utilized to fund the growth of the company s real estate finance and equipment leasing operations 
provision for possible losses increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september  the increase was primarily the result of increases in the provisions for possible losses relating to equipment leasing to million and for possible losses relating to real estate finance to 
the increased provisions reflect the increases in both lease originations and investments in real estate loans 
the effective tax rate increased to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  the fiscal increase resulted from i an increase in the statutory tax rate due to an increase in the company s pre tax earnings  ii a decrease in the generation of depletion for tax purposes  iii a decrease in low income housing tax credits  iv a decrease in tax exempt interest in relationship to pre tax income  and v an increase in state income taxes 
the increase in effective tax rate resulted in an increased provision for taxes of million for over the tax that would have been payable had the tax rate been in effect 
liquidity and capital resources year ended september  compared to year ended september  during the past three fiscal years  the company has derived its capital resources from three main sources public and private offerings of debt and equity securities  lines of credit and purchase facilities extended by banks and other institutional lenders with respect to equipment leasiing and energy operations  and sales of senior lien interests in or borrower refinancings of commercial mortgage loans held in the company s portfolio 
the company has employed its available capital resources primarily in the expansion of its small ticket leasing and real estate finance businesses 
however  through its acquisitions of the atlas group and viking resources  the company has significantly expanded its oil and gas operations and  as a result  may direct capital resources to oil and gas operations as other opportunities arise or as the company s oil and gas business develops 
the company believes that its future growth and earnings will be materially dependent upon its ability to continue to generate capital resources from prior sources or to identify new sources 
as a result of the continued depressed price of the company s common stock  the company anticipates that generating additional capital resources on terms similar to those available to it during fiscal and may be restricted 
accordingly  the company s ability to generate continued growth in its real estate finance and equipment leasing operations may be restricted  which could adversely affect the company s earnings potential 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s sources and uses of cash for the years ended september    and years ended september  in thousands provided by used in operations    used in investing activities    provided by financing activities    provided by used in discontinued operations  decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents    year ended september  compared to year ended september  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september   as compared to million at september  the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in the year ended september  as compared to to in the year ended september  cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the following decreases in gains on asset dispositions of million offset by an increase in accretion net of interest income of million 
the company s cash used in investing activities increased million in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  as a result of the following i in small ticket leasing  cash used increased million primarily as a result of an increase of million in cash used to acquire equipment for lease 
the company also used million to acquire jla credit 
this increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets million and an increase in payments in excess of revenue recognized million 
ii in energy  cash used increased million as a result of the participation in the drilling of wells through atlas million and cash used to acquire viking resources million 
iii the investment of million in fiscal in resource asset 
iv in real estate finance  cash used increased million as a result of a decrease of million in principal payments and proceeds from the sale of loans  offset by a decrease in investments in real estate loans and ventures 
the company s cash flow provided by financing activities increased million during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase resulted from a million increase in the company s net borrowings  partially offset by a decrease of million in proceeds from issuance of stock 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september   as compared to million at september  the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in the year ended september  as compared to to in the year ended september  cash provided by operating activities in fiscal decreased million as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the following increases in net income and other non cash adjustments of million and million  respectively  increases in gains on asset dispositions  accretion of discount and collection of interest income of million  million and million respectively  increases in operating assets of million  and decreases in operating liabilities of million 
the company s cash used in investing activities increased million in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of cash used to fund increased real estate finance and small ticket leasing activities 
in real estate finance  the company invested million and million in the acquisition or origination of loans and loans in the years ended september  and  respectively 
in addition  the company advanced funds on existing commercial loans of million and million in the same respective periods 
cash proceeds received upon refinancings or sales of senior lien interests and loans amounted to million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively 
these proceeds reflect the sale of loans and senior lien interests in or refinancing of and nine loans  respectively 
in small ticket leasing  the company invested million and million in the origination of  and  leases in the years ended september  and  respectively 
cash proceeds received upon sales of leases amounted to million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively 
the company s cash flow provided by financing activities decreased million during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  since  during fiscal  the company completed both an equity and a debt offering  while in fiscal the company completed an equity offering only 
dividends in the years ended september   and  million  million and million were paid in dividends  respectively 
the company has paid regular quarterly dividends since august the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid is in the sole discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend on the various factors affecting the company s financial condition and other matters the board of directors deems relevant  including restrictions which may be imposed pursuant to the indenture under which the notes were issued 
inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the company s operating expenses and increases in those expenses may not be recoverable by increases in finance rates chargeable by the company 
inflation also affects interest rates and movements in rates may adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s revenues and the value of its oil and gas properties have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to fluctuations which the company is unable to control or accurately predict 
computer systems and year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four digits  to identify the year in a date field 
any computer programs using such a system  and which have date sensitive software  will not be able to distinguish between the year and the year this could result in miscalculations or an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities  which could cause a disruption of business operations 
the company s year compliance review included assessing its information technology and non information technology systems collectively  the systems  contacting third party vendors  customers and other suppliers regarding their year compliance  testing the systems and remediating any problems 
based upon a recent assessment by the company  the company has year capable systems for its real estate finance  equipment leasing and energy operations 
in december  the company s equipment leasing subsidiary purchased a new telephone system and a building security system which were developed to be year compliant 
because all of its computer systems and software applications have been purchased from third parties  it has obtained certifications from all of its major software vendors as to the year compliance of their products 
fidelity leasing also tested all of its servers and core operating systems 
fidelity leasing booked leases that expire in and after the year into the system with no unresolved problems in its booking system 
as a result  the company believes that its equipment leasing servers and operating systems are year compliant 
the company s real estate finance and energy operations have completed an assessment of all systems that would be affected by the year issue if not modified 
these operations have completed all remediation disclosed by the assessment and related testing 
the company has initiated formal communications with all customers  equipment vendors and other suppliers that are material to its operations 
it has received written assurances from all of its significant customers and third party service providers responding to its year inquiries 
the responses indicate that these third parties expect  at this time  to be compliant by the year based on their progress to date 
in addition  the company verified the year readiness of much of its specific operations equipment  software  and hardware through vendor published product bulletins 
these assurances provide comfort that its third party vendors are aware of and are addressing their year issues  but they cannot guarantee the company that they will not encounter year problems that could negatively impact the company s business 
as a result of its internal assessment and survey of its business partners  the company currently does not believe that year matters will have a material impact on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
to the extent that any of its business partners are materially affected by year problems  the company intends to seek alternative firms providing the same services that are year compliant 
in view of the responses from its current business partners  the company will identify alternative firms on an as needed basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company would be able to make appropriate arrangements should the need arise and  accordingly  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected if problems with its business partners arise 
environmental regulation a continued trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry and the company 
the company monitors environmental and safety laws and believes it is in compliance with such laws and applicable regulations thereunder 
to date  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
the company believes  however  that environmental and safety costs will increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that compliance with such laws will not  in the future  materially impact the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table sets forth certain information regarding of the loans held in the company s portfolio as of september  the presentation  for each category of information  aggregates the loans by their maturity dates for maturities occurring in each of the fiscal years through and separately aggregates the information for all maturities arising after the fiscal year 
the company does not believe that these loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates since i the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to the company and thus are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  ii all senior lien interests are at fixed rates and are thus not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to the company  and iii each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flow were to exceed the interest rate  as originally underwritten

pay rates are equal to the net cash flow from the underlying properties after payments on senior lien interests and  accordingly  depend upon future events not determinable as of the date hereof 
maturity dates for senior lien interests are as follows maturity date of maturity dates of company s loans senior lien interests outstanding balance fiscal year ended fiscal year ended of senior lien interests september september at september  maturity date of maturity dates of company s loans senior lien interests outstanding balance fiscal year ended fiscal year ended of senior lien interests september september at september  none thereafter  total  the following table sets forth information concerning two of the loans held in the company s portfolio at september  that the company believes may be deemed to be interest rate sensitive 
outstanding receivable balance to the company s interest   carried cost of loan   stated interest rate federal funds rate plus basis points plus basis points default interest interest payment rate net cash flow from property net cash flow from property underlying loan underlying loan principal balance of related senior lien interest   stated interest rate senior lien interest 
libor plus basis points libor plus basis points maximum rate current interest payment rate senior lien interest maturity date senior lien interest the carried cost of this loan includes million of senior lien indebtedness which was repaid in october interest rate risk and hedging 
fidelity leasing s commercial paper conduit facilities  which are at variable rates of interest  require fidelity leasing to enter into interest rate swap agreements for the benefit of the purchaser of the leases 
because the cost of funding under the commercial paper conduit facility is floating and the rental stream is fixed  an interest rate swap is needed to hedge the resulting risk 
under an interest rate swap  the related special purpose entity agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive payment of a floating rate from a counterparty 
if short term interest rates increase  then the fixed rate of interest the special purpose entity is paying under the swap will be less than the short term rate it is receiving  resulting in a payment to the special purpose entity 
this payment will be used to offset the higher borrowing costs under the commercial paper borrowings 
if short term rates fall  then the fixed rate of interest the special purpose entity is paying under the swap will be higher than the short term rate it is receiving  resulting in a payment to the counterparty 
therefore  the interest rate swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate of the borrowings during the securitization period 
fidelity leasing entered into similar interest rate swap agreements in connection with the c million line of credit from the bank of montreal and the million term loan from commerce bank 
fidelity leasing intends to hold both of these swaps and the assets in these facilities for their entire lives 
fidelity leasing also uses interest rate swaps from commercial paper conduit facilities to manage interest rate risk resulting from the term note securitizations 
this risk arises because benchmark fixed rates of interest  including yields on treasury bonds and asset backed bonds  are subject to normal market fluctuations 
consequently  it is possible that fixed interest rates payable on asset backed securities may have increased since the time a lease was originated  and that the prevailing market rate  and thus the rate paid on the term note securitizations  may approach or exceed the implicit interest rate of the leases securitized 
interest rate swaps can mitigate this risk 
an interest rate swap permits a special purpose entity to terminate a swap in connection with the transfer of leases from a commercial paper conduit facility to a term note securitization 
upon termination  the swap counterparty determines the amount due from or owed to the special purpose entity in order to terminate the swap 
the amount of such payment is based on the prevailing market rates for interest rate swaps 
for example  if benchmark fixed rates of interest have increased significantly since the commencement of the terminated swap  and all other relevant factors have remained constant  the counterparty would most likely be required to make a payment to the special purpose entity upon termination 
this payment would  in part  offset the negative impact of securitizing the lease in a term note securitization at a time when fixed interest rates for asset backed securities have increased when compared to benchmark fixed interest rates prevailing at the time the lease was originated 
in contrast  if benchmark fixed rates of interest have decreased significantly since the commencement of the terminated swap and all other relevant factors have remained constant  the special purpose entity would most likely be required to make a payment to the counterparty upon termination 
this payment by the special purpose entity would have the effect of offsetting the otherwise positive impact of securitizing the lease in a lower fixed interest rate environment
