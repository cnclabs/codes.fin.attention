overview the company is a full service contract research organization cro serving the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
the company designs  monitors and manages preclinical and clinical trials  provides clinical data management and biostatistical services and offers product registration and pharmacoeconomic services throughout the united states  canada and europe 
the company generates substantially all of its revenue from the preclinical and clinical testing of new pharmaceutical and biotechnology products 
the company s contracts are typically fixed price contracts which range in duration from a few months to a few years 
the contracts usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at or near the time the trial is initiated with the remaining contract amount paid in intervals based upon the completion of certain negotiated performance requirements or milestones and  to a lesser extent  on a date certain basis 
the company s contracts generally may be terminated with or without cause 
in the event of termination  the company is typically entitled to all sums owed for work performed through the notice of termination and all costs associated with termination of the study 
in addition  at times some of the company s contracts provide for an early termination fee  the amount of which usually declines as the trial progresses 
termination or delay in the performance of a contract may occur for various reasons  including  but not limited to  unexpected or undesired results  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  production problems resulting in shortages of the drug  adverse patient reactions to the drug  or the client s decision to de emphasize a particular trial 
revenue for contracts is recorded in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts as costs are incurred and includes estimated earned fees or profits calculated on the basis of the relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs cost to cost type of percentage of completion method of accounting 
additionally  the company may begin work on a project before a contract is signed for customers with whom the company has formed a strategic alliance or has a long term relationship 
revenue is recognized in the same manner as signed contracts based upon terms verbally agreed with the customer 
revenue is affected by the mix of trials conducted and the degree to which labor and facilities are utilized 
the company recognizes revenue related to contract modifications when realization is assured and the amounts can be reasonably determined 
when estimated contract costs indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract  the entire loss is provided for in such period 
the company routinely subcontracts with third party investigators in connection with multi site clinical trials and with other third party service providers for laboratory analysis and other specialized services 
subcontractor costs are passed through to clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in gross service revenue 
subcontractor costs are accrued on a straight line basis over the investigator phase of the contract 
subcontractor services may vary significantly from contract to contract  therefore  changes in gross service revenue may not be indicative of trends in revenue growth 
accordingly  the company views net service revenue  which consists of gross service revenue less subcontractor costs  as its primary measure of revenue growth 
the company has had  and is expected to continue to have  certain clients from which at least of the company s overall revenue is generated over multiple contracts 
such concentrations of business are not uncommon within the cro industry 
backlog consists of anticipated net service revenue from letters of intent and contracts that have not been completed 
once work under a letter of intent or contract commences  net service revenue is recognized over the life of the contract using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
since it is common for clients to authorize projects and the company to commence providing services before a contract is signed  the company believes reported backlog should consist of anticipated net revenue from uncompleted projects which have been authorized by a client  through a written contract or otherwise 
at december   backlog was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the company believes that backlog is not a consistent indicator of future results because backlog can be affected by a number of factors  including the variable size and duration of projects  many of which are performed over several years 
additionally  projects may be terminated by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for many reasons  including unexpected test results 
moreover  the scope of a project can change during the course of a study 
the company s core european operation consists of offices in maidenhead  united kingdom and brussels  belgium 
the company expanded its ability to perform global clinical trials by opening offices in australia  chile  france  and israel in and italy and scotland in the company has made significant investments in the marketing and infrastructure of its core european operations  however  net revenue has not sufficiently grown to cover the increased expense levels and in the fourth quarter of the company decided to reduce its general and administrative workforce see restructuring charge discussion below 
the company is focused on generating new business while controlling its cost structure 
acquisition of bio research laboratories ltd 
on july   the company purchased  for million in cash  all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of bio research laboratories ltd 
of montreal  quebec bioresearch 
bioresearch is a leading contract research organization which provides services to clients in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and medical device industries 
bioresearch designs and conducts preclinical trials  based primarily upon animal models  that produce the data required to assess and evaluate efficacy in and potential risks to humans 
the acquisition was financed with the proceeds of a public offering of  shares of the company s common stock at per share on july  as adjusted for the company s three for two stock split in november 
net proceeds to the company from the offering were approximately million  million of which was used to fund the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operations of bioresearch are included in the company s results of operations from the date of the acquisition 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that its current revenue levels would not support its general and administrative cost structure 
as a result  the company recorded a million restructuring charge for costs to be incurred in reducing its workforce  primarily in europe 
at december   the entire million restructuring charge is included in accrued expenses as no termination benefits had been paid 
in the fiscal year ended december   the company paid the entire amount of million in restructuring costs  primarily in severance costs to employees 
on april   the company announced that its data management operations in lexington  kentucky would be closed and consolidated into its new clinical research center in research triangle park  north carolina 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter of in connection with the closing of the company s lexington facility  severance costs for the termination of employees and costs associated with lease commitments following the company s restructuring decision to consolidate facilities 
the restructuring charge consists of the following in thousands balance in amount of accrued restructuring expenses charge at write down of assets in connection with closure of lexington facility  lease costs associated with consolidation of facilities  severance costs  other results of operations the company s operating segments consist of preclinical trials which are performed by the company s canadian subsidiary and clinical trials which are performed primarily in the united states and europe 
summarized below in thousands is the company s net revenue and income loss from operations for each reportable segment as defined by financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
other includes operations not directly related to the segments and corporate expenses 
see segment reporting note to consolidated financial statements of the company 
net revenue us clinical    europe clinical    total clinical    canada preclinical    total company    segment profit loss us clinical    europe clinical   total clinical    canada preclinical    other    total company    year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million  or diluted loss per share  compared to net loss in the same period of of million or diluted loss per share 
the increase in the net loss is primarily attributable to the restructuring charge of million discussed above  the significant decrease in the company s effective tax benefit rate discussed below  and the cancellations of clinical contracts  aggregating approximately million in backlog  which occurred in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of discussed previously along with an insufficient level of new clinical orders to cover the previously noted cancellations 
as a result  revenue recognized has not been sufficient to cover expenses since the second quarter of the canadian dollar was weaker in fiscal than in fiscal in relation to the us dollar  while the british pound was stronger in relation to the us dollar 
excluding the effect of the changes in the average exchange rates from to  the company s diluted loss per share would have been as compared to the reported 
net service revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a level of new clinical orders which was insufficient to cover prior period cancellations of clinical contracts previously discussed  which resulted in a decrease in clinical net revenue 
net revenue from preclinical operations increased primarily due to the strength of new orders and backlog existing at the beginning of the year which was partially offset by a weaker canadian dollar in excluding the effect of the foreign currency translation  preclinical revenue increased in as compared to direct costs include compensation and benefits for billable employees as well as other costs directly related to contracts 
direct costs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal direct costs increased as a percentage of net service revenue to from due to unbillable resources resulting from the previously discussed clinical project cancellations and an insufficient level of new clinical orders to cover these cancellations 
direct costs as a percentage of net service revenue for the company s preclinical operations improved to as compared to in the prior year 
direct costs are based on the mix of contracts in progress and as a percentage of net revenue may fluctuate from period to period dependent upon the mix of contracts in the backlog 
in addition  direct costs will fluctuate due to changes in labor and facility utilization 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million in from million in the same period in primarily due to the opening of the glasgow facility in november  increases in lease costs and one time costs to move into the company s new clinical research center in research triangle park  north carolina which offset cost savings from the closing of the company s lexington facility in april  an increase in bad debt expense to cover potential collection issues  and severance costs incurred to replace us and european clinical management personnel that was not included in restructuring costs 
selling  general and administrative costs increased as a percentage of net service revenue to from 
the increase as a percentage of net revenue is primarily attributable to lower levels of clinical revenue resulting from project cancellations and an insufficient level of new orders 
selling  general and administrative costs  which primarily includes compensation for administrative employees and costs related to facilities  information technology and marketing  are relatively fixed in the near term  while revenue is subject to fluctuation due primarily to variations in the timing of contracts or the progress of clinical trials both delays and accelerations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in compared to million in as increased depreciation resulting from capital expenditures was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization for the closing of the company s lexington facility in april interest income  net of interest expense  was million in compared to million in primarily due to lower cash balances available for short term investments 
the company s benefit for income taxes was million in the as compared to million in the effective tax benefit rate in was compared to in the effective tax benefit rate declined in as the company fully realized its available us tax loss carrybacks in the second quarter of due to the restrictions that accounting standards place on deferred tax assets associated with loss carryforwards  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million in for its deferred tax assets related to the company s potential tax benefit of such loss carryforwards associated with its operating loss in year ended december  compared with year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million  or diluted loss per share  compared to net income in the same period of of million or diluted earnings per share 
excluding the restructuring charge  the net loss for fiscal was million or diluted loss per share 
the company s preclinical subsidiary  bioresearch  was acquired on july  see discussion above and its operations are included in the company s results of operations from the date of acquisition 
excluding the operating results of bioresearch  the company s net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income of million in the decrease in the company s clinical operating performance is primarily attributable to the cancellations of clinical contracts  aggregating approximately million in backlog  which occurred in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of and the underperformance of the company s european operations 
the decrease in backlog left the company with unbillable resources related to those projects as well as a higher level of direct costs and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred to cover the expected higher revenue levels 
none of the cancellations were related to service or quality problems 
backlog of future net revenue was million contracts from clients at december   compared to million contracts from clients at march  following the contract cancellations 
due to the mix of contracts in backlog and the underperformance of the european operations  revenue recognized in was not sufficient to cover expenses and the company incurred a loss for fiscal the canadian dollar was weaker in fiscal than in fiscal in relation to the us dollar  while the british pound was stronger in relation to the us dollar 
excluding the effect of the changes in the average exchange rates from to  the company s diluted loss per share would have been excluding the restructuring charge as compared to the reported 
net service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding revenue recognized related to bioresearch  net service revenue decreased 
this decrease primarily occurred in the us clinical segment  which declined primarily resulting from the cancellations of clinical contracts previously discussed 
direct costs included compensation and benefits for billable employees as well as other costs directly related to contracts 
direct costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal costs in include a full year of bioresearch s operations 
direct costs increased as a percentage of net service revenue to from due to unbillable resources resulting from the previously discussed clinical project cancellations and underperformance of the company s european operations 
direct costs as a percentage of net service revenue for the company s preclinical operations was in as compared to in direct costs are based on the mix of contracts in progress and as a percentage of net revenue may fluctuate from period to period dependent upon the mix of contracts in the backlog 
in addition  direct costs will fluctuate due to changes in labor and facility utilization 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal costs in include a full year of bioresearch s operations 
selling  general and administrative costs increased as a percentage of net service revenue to from 
the increase as a percentage of net revenue is primarily attributable to lower levels of revenue resulting from clinical project cancellations and underperformance of the company s european operations 
selling  general and administrative costs  which primarily includes compensation for administrative employees and costs related to facilities  information technology and marketing  are relatively fixed in the near term while revenue is subject to fluctuation  therefore  minor variations in the timing of contracts or the progress of clinical trials both delays and accelerations may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
in addition  the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs related to expanded infrastructure required to open new offices or expand existing offices as described previously 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to amortization of goodwill and depreciation of property  plant and equipment incurred in the acquisition of bioresearch 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased to million in from million in the company s benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal as compared to a provision of million in fiscal the effective tax benefit rate in was compared to an effective tax rate of in this increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of research and development tax credits generated by the company s canadian subsidiary partially offset by the unrecognized tax benefit associated with foreign net operating losses 
other significant items that create the difference between the company s federal statutory and effective tax rates are state and local taxes  tax exempt interest income and nondeductible amortization of goodwill 
the company  in general  will not record a tax asset related to a foreign jurisdiction for losses incurred in its foreign operations until such time  if any  that it has three years of profits in the applicable jurisdiction 
however  the company will recognize a tax benefit for losses incurred in its foreign operations as the subsidiary generates taxable income to the extent of the cumulative losses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary operating cash needs on both a short term and long term basis include the payment of salaries  office rent and travel expenses  as well as capital expenditures 
the company has historically financed these expenditures  as well as acquisitions  with cash flow from operations  issuances of equity securities and borrowings under its lines of credit 
the company utilizes its working capital to finance these expenditures pending receipt of its receivables 
contract receipts from the company s clients vary according to the terms of each contract 
prerequisites for billings are generally established by contractual provisions that include predetermined date certain payment schedules which may include payment at or near the time the trial is initiated  the achievement of negotiated performance requirements or milestones  or the submission of required billing detail 
unbilled receivables arise from those contracts under which services performed exceed billings which are rendered upon the achievement of certain negotiated performance requirements or on a date certain basis 
advance billings represent contractual billings for services not yet rendered 
as of december   the company s advance billings were million and its accounts receivables of million included million of unbilled receivables 
the company expects to bill and collect these unbilled receivables within one year of revenue recognition 
cash receipts do not correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognition which is typically based on cost to cost type of percentage of completion accounting and therefore  the company s cash flow is influenced by the interaction of changes in receivables and advance billings 
the company typically receives a low volume of large dollar cash receipts 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable which includes unbilled receivables was days at december   compared to days at december  the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable which includes unbilled receivables net of advance billings was days at december   compared to days at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  as compared to million at december  during the year ended december   net cash used by operating activities totaled million  primarily due to a loss before noncash items of million of which million related to the restructuring charge  which was primarily offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of million  a decrease in net accounts receivable net of advance billings and the allowance for doubtful accounts of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in net payables to investigators of million 
cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million and costs associated with an option to acquire mpi research  llc mpi of million 
capital expenditures have primarily been made for computer system additions and upgrades  personal computer equipment and expenditures on facility improvements 
capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately million in in the first quarter of  the company replaced its million domestic credit facility with a million domestic credit facility which has expansion capabilities to million provided the company meets certain financial requirements 
credit availability under the company s new domestic line of credit and its foreign line of credit the credit facilities totals approximately million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the lines of credit at december  commitment availability at december  has been reduced by issued letters of credit of approximately  the lines of credit are collateralized by certain of the company s assets and amounts outstanding would bear interest at a fluctuating rate based either on the respective banks prime interest rate or the london interbank offered rate libor  as elected by the company 
borrowings available under the lines of credit are subject to certain financial and operating covenants 
the company s canadian subsidiary borrowed approximately  from the canadian government in march this borrowing bears no interest and is repayable in four annual installments beginning in the company expects to continue expanding its operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
the company expects such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
although pressure on cash reserves is expected  the company estimates that its sources of cash will be sufficient to fund the company s current operations  including planned capital expenditures  over the next year 
there may be acquisition or other growth opportunities which require additional external financing  and the company may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurances that such financings will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors such as delays experienced in implementing or completing particular clinical trials and termination of clinical trials  the costs associated with integrating acquired operations  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  as well as the costs associated with opening new offices 
since a high percentage of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  minor variations in the timing of contracts or the progress of clinical trials both delays and accelerations may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt sfas no 
effective january  the company s canadian subsidiary enters into forward exchange currency contracts to hedge its united states dollar denominated contracts in backlog 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on the financial position of the company 
year issue the company is engaged in a major effort to minimize the impact of the year date change on its products  services  information systems  laboratories and facilities 
the company has targeted september  for completion of these efforts and plans to have all clinical systems year compliant by mid year  the year challenge is a priority within the company at every level 
primary year global preparedness responsibility rests with a year project manager 
the year project manager is augmented by a group  which has been assigned specific year responsibilities in addition to their regular assignments 
the year assignments take priority over their regular assignments 
the overall strategy for year compliance at the company is  wherever possible  to replace potentially non compliant software and hardware with new compliant systems 
the one exception to this strategy is that the company will be upgrading its clinical data management systems and supporting subsystems to year compliant versions 
since all of these systems fall under good clinical practices regulations there will be extensive testing and documentation of the upgrade process 
the inventory and assessment phase of the year assessment program has largely been completed with respect to its information systems  laboratories and facilities 
the company has commenced the remediation phase of this effort through a combination of product upgrades and replacement 
plans have been developed to facilitate the completion of this work  as well as the related testing and deployment  by september  currently  approximately of the company s information technology infrastructure has been determined to be year ready and is deployed for use 
approximately  of the applications requiring year remediation that are supported by the company s information technology group are now year ready and have been deployed or are awaiting deployment 
the company is monitoring the progress of readiness efforts across the company  with a special emphasis in the early identification of any areas where progress to date could indicate difficulty in meeting the company s target dates 
the company is developing specific contingency plans  as appropriate 
the company is also assessing the year readiness of the facilities that it owns or leases worldwide 
the company plans to complete remediation efforts by september  and to complete development of applicable contingency plans by august  to ensure the continued delivery of third party products and services the company s procurement organization has analyzed the company s supplier s base and has sent surveys to approximately suppliers 
follow up efforts have commenced to obtain feedback from critical suppliers 
to supplement this effort  the company plans to conduct readiness reviews of the year status of suppliers ranked most critical based on their relationships with the company  the product service provided  and or the content of their survey responses 
almost all of the company s suppliers are still deeply engaged in executing their year readiness efforts and  as a result  the company cannot  at this time  fully evaluate the year risks to its supply chain 
the company will continue to monitor the year status of its suppliers to minimize this risk and will develop appropriate contingent responses as the risk becomes clearer 
the risk resulting from the failure of third parties in the public and private sector to attain year readiness is the same as other firms in the company s industry or other business enterprises in general 
the following are representative of the types of risks that could result in the event of one or more of the company s information systems  laboratories  or facilities failed to be year ready  or similar major failures by one or more major third party suppliers to the company information systems could include interruptions or disruptions of business and transaction processing such as customer billing  payroll  accounts payable and other operating and information processing  until systems can be remedied or replaced  laboratory facilities could include interruptions or disruptions of data management processes and facilities with delays in delivery of services  until non compliant conditions or components can be remedied or replaced  and major suppliers to the company could include interruptions or disruptions of the supply of raw materials  supplies and year ready components which could cause interruptions or disruptions and delays in delivery of services  until the third party suppliers remedied the problem or contingency measures can be implemented 
risks of major failures of the company s principal services and products could include late delivery of study reports to customers  the cost and resources for the company to remedy problems where the company is obligated or undertakes such action  and delays in startup of new studies 
the company believes it is taking the necessary steps to resolve its year issues  however  given the possible consequences of failure to resolve significant year issues  there can be no assurance that any one or more such failures would not have material adverse effects on the company 
the current estimate of total year project costs is million 
during the year ended december   the company spent million to purchase hardware and software and used internal resources of million primarily salary costs for a total of million on its year issues 
during  the company estimates it will spend million on hardware and software and devote million in internal resources to address year issues 
work projects have been prioritized to largely address year readiness 
as a result  most of these costs represent costs that would have been incurred in any event 
these amounts cover costs of the year readiness work for inventory  assessment  remediation  testing and deployment including fees and charges of contractors for outsourced work and consultants fees 
costs for previously contemplated updates and replacements of the company s internal systems and information systems infrastructure have been included in these estimates when such upgrades or replacements have been accelerated 
while the year cost estimates include additional costs  the company believes  based on available information  that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on its business operations  services or financial condition 
the actual outcomes and results could be affected by future factors including  but not limited to  the continued availability of skilled personnel  cost control  the ability to locate and remediate software code problems  critical suppliers  subcontractors meeting their commitments to be year ready and provide year ready products  and timely actions by customers 
foreign currency the company conducts business in several foreign countries and approximately  and of the company s net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
since its acquisition in  the company s preclinical operations in canada has generated more than of the company s non us revenue 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in the functional currency of the company s foreign subsidiary  but payments on contracts are made by the client in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the company s foreign subsidiary s operating results 
additionally  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the company s subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
translation adjustments are reported with accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
such adjustments may in the future be material to the company s financial statements 
income taxes the company s financial statements do not reflect us or additional foreign taxes on the possible distribution of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings have been permanently reinvested 
should the company determine the need to distribute these undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  it would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries 
in the second quarter of  the company fully realized the income tax benefit on its available us income tax loss carrybacks 
due to restrictions that accounting standards place on deferred tax assets associated with loss carryforwards  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million in for its deferred tax assets related to the company s potential tax benefit of such loss carryforward associated with its operating loss in the company expects to record a valuation allowance in on deferred tax assets that may result from the potential tax benefit on loss carryforwards associated with the company s expected operating loss in fiscal
