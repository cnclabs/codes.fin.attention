item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to the future financial performance of regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc regeneron or the company and actual events or results may differ materially 
these statements concern  among other things  the possible therapeutic applications of the company s product candidates and research programs  the timing and nature of the company s clinical and research programs now underway or planned  a variety of items described herein and in the footnotes to the company s financial statements including the useful life of assets  the anticipated length of agreements  and other matters  and the future uses of capital and financial needs of the company 
these statements are made by the company based on management s current beliefs and judgment 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and potential investors should specifically consider the various factors identified under the caption factors that may affect future operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
regeneron is a new york corporation founded in regeneron is a leader in the application of molecular and cell biology to discover novel potential therapeutics for human medical conditions and is seeking to develop and commercialize these discoveries 
the company is applying its technological expertise in protein growth factors  their receptors  and their mechanisms of action to the discovery and development of protein based drugs and orally active  small molecule drugs 
the company is pursuing research and development programs in the following areas o axokine registered second generation ciliary neurotrophic factor for the treatment of obesity and diseases related to obesity such as type ii diabetes  o brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  commonly known as lou gehrig s disease  o neurotrophin nt for the treatment of constipating conditions  o angiogenesis  including stimulating blood vessel growth in settings where more blood flow is desired and blocking blood vessel growth in abnormal conditions such as cancer 
the angiogenesis program is based on regeneron s discovery of angiopoietins  a new family of ligands and their receptors  called the tie family of receptors that appears to regulate blood vessel formation  o protein antagonists for cytokines such as interleukin il  interleukin il and interleukin il as potential treatment of inflammatory diseases  allergic disorders  and cancer  o axokine for the treatment of retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa  o muscle atrophy  using a variety of approaches to identify and validate drug targets  and o research programs to discover orally active  small molecule based drugs  some of which may mimic or antagonize protein or receptor based drug candidates that the company is developing 
in  the company continued to develop axokine under the company s collaboration agreement the p g agreement with the procter gamble company procter gamble 
the company and procter gamble filed an investigational new drug application ind with the united states food and drug administration fda in the first quarter of and plan to commence a phase i clinical study during the first half of to determine the safety of axokine administered subcutaneously for a short duration to mildly to moderately obese healthy volunteers 
axokine is being developed for the treatment of obesity associated with type ii diabetes and possibly for uncomplicated obesity 
no assurance can be made regarding the timing or result of this or any further clinical trial of axokine 
axokine has never been administered to people 
its safety and efficacy in the treatment of any human condition have not been established and can not be predicted 
previous clinical studies of ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf  the parent molecule of axokine  resulted in the creation of antibodies and adverse events side effects in patients  including weight loss  cough  nausea  and malaise 
while certain aspects of the development of axokine by the company and procter gamble have focused on attempting to avoid or minimize antibody production or adverse events  no assurance may be given that these problems will be avoided or minimized or that they will not lead to the failure  delay  or additional difficulty in conducting axokine clinical trials 
the company and procter gamble also continued to collaborate in research and development in the fields of angiogenesis  bone growth and related areas  muscle injury and atrophy  and small molecule orally active drugs 
the majority of the company s scientific resources are devoted to its collaborative activities with procter gamble 
the company continued independently to develop axokine for use in treating retinitis pigmentosa 
in july  the company and medtronic  inc medtronic terminated their collaborative development agreement to conduct an exploratory research program using medtronic delivery systems to deliver axokine to the central nervous system  initially as a potential treatment for huntington s disease  due to obstacles in formulation and delivery 
during  the company continued to develop independent of any corporate collaboration its proprietary cytokine traps for the potential treatment of asthma  inflammatory disease  cancer  and rheumatoid arthritis 
in addition  the company continued to conduct research with pharmacopeia  inc and glaxo wellcome plc in the area of small molecule orally active drugs 
during  amgen regeneron partners  the partnership equally owned by regeneron and amgen inc amgen  continued to develop bdnf and nt bdnf is currently being developed by amgen regeneron partners for potential use in treating als through two routes of administration intrathecal infusion into the spinal fluid through an implanted pump and subcutaneous injection under the skin 
in the fourth quarter of  amgen  on behalf of the partnership  began an intrathecal study in more than patients with als 
subcutaneous studies conducted by regeneron on behalf of the partnership began in the first quarter of the subcutaneous studies are based on an analysis of the amgen regeneron partners phase iii trial of bdnf for als that was completed in that trial failed to achieve its predetermined end points  but subsequent analyses indicated that a retrospectively defined subset of als patients in the trial may have received a survival benefit from bdnf treatment 
a multi center study of more than als patients who will receive bdnf subcutaneously is expected to begin in the company and sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
sumitomo pharmaceuticals are collaborating in the development of bdnf in japan  initially for the treatment of als 
in march  sumitomo pharmaceuticals commenced a phase i safety assessment of bdnf delivered subcutaneously to normal volunteers 
in august  sumitomo pharmaceuticals signed a license agreement for the development of bdnf in japan 
pursuant to the license agreement  sumitomo pharmaceuticals made a million research progress payment reduced by million of japanese withholding tax to regeneron in august and will make additional payments upon the achievement of specified milestones 
sumitomo pharmaceuticals will also pay a royalty on sales of bdnf in japan 
amgen regeneron partners clinical development of nt is currently focused on constipating conditions 
in  regeneron  on behalf of amgen regeneron partners  completed a small clinical study that included healthy volunteers and patients suffering from severe idiopathic constipation and began additional small studies in patients who suffer from constipation associated with conditions such as spinal cord injury and parkinson s disease 
no assurance can be given that extended administration of bdnf or nt will be safe or effective 
the treatment of als has been shown  in a number of clinical settings using a variety of treatment modalities including amgen regeneron partners earlier clinical studies  to present significant difficulties 
the design of an als clinical study presents special difficulties and risks  as do the facts that als is a progressive disease that afflicts individual patients differently and other als treatments are approved or have been or are currently being tested  creating the possibility that patients in any bdnf study may also receive other therapeutics during all or part of the bdnf trial 
the treatment of various constipating conditions may present additional clinical trial risks in light of the complex and not wholly understood mechanisms of action that lead to the conditions  the concurrent use of other drugs to treat the underlying illnesses as well as the gastrointestinal condition  the potential difficulty of designing and achieving significant clinical end points  and other factors 
no assurance can be given that these or any other studies of bdnf or nt will be successful or that bdnf or nt will be commercialized 
substantial risk is inherent in the research  development  and commercialization of drugs 
in addition  in each of the areas of the company s independent and collaborative activities  other companies and entities are actively pursuing competitive paths toward similar objectives 
the results of the company s and its collaborators past activities in connection with the research and development of axokine  cytokine traps  angiopoietins  abnormal bone growth  muscle atrophy  small molecules  bdnf  nt  and other programs or areas of research or development do not necessarily predict the results or success of current or future activities including  but not limited to  any additional preclinical or clinical studies 
the company cannot predict whether  when  or under what conditions any of its research or product candidates  including without limitation axokine  bdnf  or nt  will be shown to be safe or effective to treat any human condition or be approved for marketing by any regulatory agency 
the delay or failure of current or future studies to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of the company s product candidates to treat human conditions or to be approved for marketing could have a material adverse impact on the company 
to date  regeneron has not received any revenues from the commercial sale of products and may never receive such revenues 
before such revenues can be realized  the company or its collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing its research and development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render the company s products and technologies noncompetitive and obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   regeneron had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from commercial product sales or other sources the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  the company s losses will continue as the company conducts its research and development activities 
the company s activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and the company s operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
the company s losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of the company s research and development efforts 
results of operations years ended december  and the company s total revenue increased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue increased to million in from million in  as higher revenue related to the p g agreement more than offset a decrease in revenue from the company s ongoing collaboration with sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
in  research progress payments of million consisted of a payment of million from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of the company s bdnf in japan reduced by million of japanese withholding tax and a payment of million from procter gamble in connection with a collaboration to develop axokine for obesity associated with type ii diabetes 
in  research progress payments of million were received from procter gamble in connection with the september amendment to the p g agreement related to axokine 
contract manufacturing revenue related to the company s manufacturing agreement the merck agreement with merck co  inc merck increased to million in compared to million in as a result of increased activity in preparation for manufacturing a product for merck at the company s rensselaer facility 
investment income in increased to million from million in  due mainly to higher levels of interest bearing investments resulting primarily from the proceeds of a private placement of equity securities with procter gamble in june the company s total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of additional employees and increased activity in the company s preclinical and clinical research programs 
the company s share of the loss in amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in  due to lower research and development expenses by the partnership 
research and development expenses including loss in amgen regeneron partners were approximately of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expenses were million in both and depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in  as certain laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements became fully depreciated 
contract manufacturing expenses  which are expenses directly related to the merck agreement and are reimbursed by merck  increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased activity in preparation for manufacturing a product for merck 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in as the amount of outstanding obligations in connection with capital leases declined 
the company s net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in years ended december  and the company s total revenue increased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue was million in and million in  as revenue received from procter gamble in connection with the p g agreement offset lower revenue from amgen regeneron partners and sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
research progress payments in of million were received from procter gamble in connection with the september amendment to the p g agreement related to axokine 
contract manufacturing revenue related to the merck agreement increased to million in from million in as a result of increased activity in preparation for manufacturing a product for merck at the company s rensselaer facility 
investment income in increased to million from million in  due primarily to higher levels of interest bearing investments resulting from the proceeds from the private placements of equity securities with amgen  medtronic  and procter gamble in and the company s total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses declined to million in from million in as less bdnf was produced for clinical use by sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the company s share of the loss in amgen regeneron partners in decreased to million from million in  reflecting lower expenses after completion of the phase iii bdnf subcutaneous clinical trial in general and administrative expenses were million in and million in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in  as certain laboratory equipment became fully depreciated and capitalized patent costs were fully amortized in contract manufacturing expenses  which are direct expenses related to the merck agreement and are reimbursed by merck  increased to million in from million in  primarily from increased services performed by the company 
interest expense was million in and million in the company s net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has financed its operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of its equity securities  revenue earned under the several agreements between the company and each of amgen  sumitomo chemical company  ltd  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  and procter gamble and investment income 
in may  the company and procter gamble entered into the p g agreement 
procter gamble agreed over the first five years of the p g agreement to purchase up to million in regeneron equity of which million was purchased in june and provide up to million in support of regeneron s research efforts related to the collaboration of which million was received through december  
during the second five years of the p g agreement  the companies will share all research costs equally 
clinical testing and commercialization expenses for jointly developed products will be shared equally throughout the ten years of the collaboration 
the companies expect jointly to develop and market worldwide any products resulting from the collaboration and share equally in profits 
either company may terminate the p g agreement at the end of five years with at least one year prior notice or earlier in the event of a default as defined in the p g agreement 
in september  the company and procter gamble expanded the p g agreement to include axokine and related molecules delivered systemically  and agreed to develop axokine initially to treat obesity associated with type ii diabetes 
procter gamble agreed to reimburse the company for certain research and development costs and pay as much as million in additional funding  partly subject to achieving certain milestones related to axokine 
of the million  million was paid in and million was paid in in connection with the company s agreement to collaborate with sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the research and development of bdnf in japan  sumitomo pharmaceuticals paid the company million through december the company also received a million research progress payment from sumitomo pharmaceuticals reduced by million of japanese withholding tax in august the company s activities relating to bdnf and nt  as agreed upon by amgen and regeneron  are being reimbursed by amgen regeneron partners  and the company recognizes such reimbursement as revenue 
the funding of amgen regeneron partners is through capital contributions from amgen and regeneron  who must make equal payments in order to maintain equal ownership and equal sharing of any profits or losses from the partnership 
the company has made capital contributions totaling million to amgen regeneron partners from the partnership s inception in june through december  the company expects that its capital contributions in will total at least million for the full year 
these contributions could increase or decrease  depending upon among other things the nature and cost of ongoing and additional bdnf and nt studies that amgen regeneron partners may conduct and the outcomes of those studies 
from its inception in january through december   the company invested million in property  plant  and equipment 
this includes million to acquire and renovate the rensselaer facility and an additional million to complete construction at the facility pursuant to the merck agreement 
in connection with the purchase and renovation of the rensselaer facility  the company obtained financing of million from the new york state urban development corporation  of which million is outstanding 
under the terms of such financing  the company is not permitted to declare or pay dividends on its equity securities 
the company expects that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
the company is currently involved in interference proceedings in the patent and trademark office between regeneron s patent applications and patents relating to cntf issued to synergen  inc synergen 
amgen acquired all outstanding shares of synergen in in march  the company and amgen entered into a covenant not to sue each other which  among other things  resolved their patent interference and related patent proceedings relating to cntf and axokine 
the company also granted amgen a license to use cntf and second generation cntfs other than axokine to treat retinal degenerative conditions 
neither party will pay royalties or make other payments to the other party in consideration of this agreement 
as of december   the company had no established banking arrangements through which it could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
additional funds may be raised through  among other things  the issuance of additional securities  other financing arrangements  and future collaboration agreements 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
in addition  the company estimates that through mid it could receive additional payments from procter gamble in the form of research funding  milestones  and equity purchases of as much as million or more 
at december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
the company expects to incur substantial funding requirements for  among other things  research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  validation of manufacturing facilities  and the acquisition of equipment 
the company expects to incur ongoing funding requirements for capital contributions to amgen regeneron partners to support the continued development and clinical trials of bdnf and nt the amount needed to fund operations will also depend on other factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of the company s research and development programs  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights developments  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research programs including those with amgen and procter gamble 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will enable it to meet operating needs for at least several years 
no assurance can be given that there will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to the company s capital being consumed significantly before such time 
factors that may affect future operating results regeneron cautions stockholders and potential investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  regeneron s actual results and could cause regeneron s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  regeneron 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose o delay  difficulty  or failure of the company s research and development programs to produce product candidates that are scientifically or commercially appropriate for further development by the company or others 
o cancellation or termination of material collaborative or licensing agreements including in particular  but not limited to  those with procter gamble and amgen and the resulting loss of research or other funding could have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
a change of control of one or more of the company s material collaborators or licensees could also have a material adverse effect on the company 
o delay  difficulty  or failure of a clinical trial of any of the company s product candidates 
a clinical trial can fail or be delayed as a result of many causes  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  the creation of antibodies in the case of protein based therapeutics that weaken or neutralize the effect of the product candidate and possibly could have other adverse effects on patients  the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
o delay  difficulty  or failure in obtaining regulatory approval including approval of its facilities for production for the company s products including vaccine intermediate for merck  including delays or difficulties in development because of insufficient proof of safety or efficacy 
o increased and irregular costs of development  manufacture  regulatory approval  sales  and marketing associated with the introduction of products in the late stage of development 
o competitive or market factors that may cause use of the company s products to be limited or otherwise fail to achieve broad acceptance 
o the ability to obtain  maintain  and prosecute intellectual property rights  and the cost of acquiring in process technology and other intellectual property rights  either by license  collaboration  or purchase of another entity 
o difficulties or high costs of obtaining adequate financing to meet the company s obligations under its collaboration and licensing agreements or to fund percent of the cost of developing product candidates in order to retain percent of the commercialization rights 
o amount and rate of growth of regeneron s general and administrative expenses  and the impact of unusual charges resulting from regeneron s ongoing evaluation of its business strategies and organizational structure 
o failure of corporate partners to develop or commercialize successfully the company s products or to retain and expand the markets served by the commercial collaborations  conflicts of interest  priorities  and commercial strategies which may arise between the company and such corporate partners 
o delays or difficulties in developing and acquiring production technology and technical and managerial personnel to manufacture novel biotechnology products in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 
o difficulties in obtaining key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of the company s product candidates 
o the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil  such as product or employment related  or environmental  or criminal  settlements and investigations  developments or assertions by or against regeneron relating to intellectual property rights and licenses  the issuance and use of patents and proprietary technology by regeneron and its competitors  including the possible negative effect on the company s ability to develop  manufacture  and sell its products in circumstances where it is unable to obtain licenses to patents which may be required for such products 
o underutilization of the company s existing or new manufacturing facilities or of any facility expansions  resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs  start up costs  inefficiencies  delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions 
o health care reform  including reductions or changes in reimbursement available for prescription medications or other reforms 
o the ability to attract and retain key personnel 
as regeneron s scientific efforts lead to potentially promising new directions  both outside of recombinant protein therapies into orally active  small molecule pharmaceuticals and outside of treatments for neurological and neurodegenerative conditions into  for example  potential programs in obesity  diabetes  cancer  inflammation  muscle disease  bone growth disorders  and angiogenesis  the company will require additional internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which it currently does not have substantial resources and personnel 
the company is evaluating its operations to determine the impact  if any  that year problems may have 
the year problem results from computer programs and devices that do not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
accordingly  computer systems that have time sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year like many corporations  regeneron does not have any previous experience with an issue like the year problem 
the year problem could affect regeneron s ability to conduct its normal operations that are date sensitive or depend on computers or equipment that contain embedded chips that are date sensitive 
it could adversely affect regeneron s ability to maintain or operate its facilities in a safe and effective manner or undertake other activities necessary and customary to carrying out its business 
in addition  the year problem could have material adverse effects on the operations or financial condition of the company s licensees  licensors  collaborators  suppliers  vendors  and others  and  in particular  utility companies that provide energy to the company s facilities and equipment  which could  in turn  have a material direct or indirect effect on regeneron 
the company s year review includes its computer systems and software  embedded systems in non computer equipment  and vendor operations 
the company has appointed a year task force with representatives from each segment of the company and has retained independent consultants to facilitate its review 
to date  the company has not learned of any material year issue with respect to its computer systems and software 
the company is in the process of analyzing its laboratory and manufacturing equipment with embedded systems 
this analysis is incomplete 
the company is also in the process of surveying its vendors who support critical business processes to determine their level of readiness with respect to year issues 
while many vendors indicate that they believe they are or will be year compliant  many others state that they can not represent that they have achieved compliance or guarantee the efficacy of their remediation efforts 
many vendors state that the problem is too complex for such a claim to have legitimacy  that efforts to solve year problems are merely in the nature of risk mitigation  and that success in such efforts will be measured  with hindsight  by the minimization of the level of technical failures and by the prompt identification and repair of failures 
the analysis of the company s embedded systems and the information collected regarding vendor readiness will be used to formulate a contingency plan with respect to reasonably identifiable items of equipment and supply of materials that are critical to the company s operations 
these analyses and plans are not complete 
no assurance can be made that the company s computer systems and software  embedded systems in non computer equipment  and vendors will be year compliant in a timely or cost effective manner 
the failure of certain third parties such as procter gamble  amgen  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  and utility and communications companies to operate in a normal and customary manner and to maintain year compliance or to assure that their vendors and suppliers are year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of regeneron 
it is possible that regeneron could be adversely affected by the failure of other third parties to be year compliant even though these third parties do not directly conduct business with regeneron 
it is not possible to guarantee that the company s year contingency plan will succeed or be timely 
the costs of addressing year issues have been minor to date  but may increase if substantial consultant or personnel resources are required or if operationally critical equipment must be remediated or replaced  or if back up energy sources must be secured assuming such personnel  equipment  or back up energy sources are reasonably available 
because the company s analysis of year issues is incomplete  at this time management cannot estimate the total expected costs of the year problem 
the risks that year problems could present to the company include  without limitation  disruption  delay  or cessation of manufacturing or other operations  including operations that are subject to regulatory compliance  and loss of research and manufacturing material and experiments that are difficult  costly  or impossible to replace 
in each case  the correction of the problem could result in substantial expense and disruption or delay of the company s operations 
impact of the future adoption of recently issued accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a comprehensive standard on accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and is effective for periods beginning after june  management does not believe that the future adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations
