ii asset quality and allowance for loan losses the investment and loan portfolios are the primary types of interest earning assets for centura 
while the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit exposure to centura  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  thorough review of potential borrowers  and ongoing review of loan payment performance 
total nonperforming assets  including nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties  were million at december  compared with million at december  nonperforming assets at year end were 
percent of total assets  up basis point from the 
percent at year end nonaccrual leases accounted for million of the increase over year end in response to increases in problem assets in the centura leasing portfolio

gross charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
recoveries were unchanged totaling million for december  and consumer net charge offs rose million during over which is consistent with trends experienced throughout the industry 
leasing net charge offs increased million primarily due to substantial increases in problem assets in the leasing portfolio 
in response to the level of charge offs and growth in the loan portfolio  the provision for loan losses increased million to million for the allowance for loan and lease losses afll grew by million to million at december   compared to million last year 
at december   centura s afll as a percentage of outstanding loans was percent compared to percent at december  the decline in the ratio of the afll to total loans is primarily the result of substantial loan growth during the fourth quarter of  a portion of which was mortgage loans held for sale that centura expects to sell in the first quarter of loan loss reserves for the commercial loan portfolio are established considering several factors including current loan grades  historical loss rates  expected future cash flows  and the results of individual loan reviews and analyses 
reserves for consumer loans  mortgage loans  and leases are determined based on past due levels and historical and projected loss rates 
loss percentages assigned for each loan grade used to develop the general allowance are determined based on periodic evaluation of actual loss experience over a period of time and management s estimate of probable losses as well as other factors that are known at the time when the appropriate level for the afll is assessed 
generally  all loans with outstanding balances of  or greater that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether specific reserves are required 
included in the afll is an unallocated amount that represents the result of analyzing less quantifiable factors such as economic trends and other risk factors that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allocation of the allowance for loans losses as of december  increased throughout all loan categories over the prior period 
the identification of additional impaired leases and increases in problem assets in the remainder of the leasing portfolio during required an additional million in loan loss reserves attributable to leases 
for all other loan categories  the allocations increased principally as a result of increased loan volume during which arose principally as a result of internal growth 
the decrease in the unallocated amount of the afll is primarily attributable to an increase in the allocation of a portion of the afll to the leasing portfolio as discussed above 
for additional information with respect to the activity in the afll  see tables and  analysis of allowance for loan losses and allocation of the allowance for loan losses  respectively 
loans past due ninety or more days were million at december   compared to million at december  accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when management has serious doubts that such interest will be collected in a reasonable period of time 
generally  open end credit lines that reach days or more past due and substantially all other loans that reach days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection 
generally  all loans past due days are placed on nonaccrual status regardless of security 
recorded accrued interest is reversed or charged off 
when borrowers demonstrate  over an extended period  the ability to repay a loan centura has classified as nonaccrual in accordance with its contractual terms  such loan is returned to accrual status 
in addition to nonperforming assets and past due loans  management has identified approximately million in loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms that management believes may become nonperforming during the remaining term of the loan 
one loan accounts for approximately million of this amount 
this loan is a participation in a secured loan to a manufacturing corporation 
ii management believes the afll to be adequate based upon its current judgment  evaluation  and analysis of the loan portfolio 
centura continuously monitors overall credit quality and manages its credit processes  including loans in past due and nonaccrual status 
the afll represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for potential current losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  management s judgment of the afll is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
the afll is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the afll and the size of the afll in comparison to peer banks identified by the regulatory agencies 
no assurances can be given that the ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of economic conditions and other factors then prevailing will not require significant future additions to the afll  thus adversely affecting the operating results of centura

as a percentage of total revenues  nii grew basis points to percent during compared to percent for nii totaled million in this was an increase of million or percent over nii 
nii  excluding securities gains  totaled million in compared to million for the increase in nii for was primarily attributed to growth in income received from service charges on deposits  insurance and brokerage commissions  mortgage income  and operating lease fees 
service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of nii  increased million to million  principally due to growth in new deposits and the impact of a mid fee increase for accounts with non sufficient funds

occupancy and equipment expenses in increased  impacted by the additions of financial stores in south carolina as a result of the pee dee acquisition and the opening of supermarket locations 
accordingly  occupancy and equipment expenses increased million over fees for outsourced services  ie  the outsourcing of various functions such as items processing  property management  and call processing generated from centura s telephone banking center  all of which are heavily volume based  increased million for the year ended december  the increase is attributed to greater volumes associated with growth in the customer base and the integration of new customers gained through acquisitions and new locations 
consistent with the acquisitions  intangible amortization increased million totaling million for compared to million expensed in as discussed below in the year yk section  centura incurred significant yk expenses which are included in noninterest expense

since  centura has invested significant resources to expand product services and delivery channels and to enhance technologies in response to a competitive and changing industry 
centura is now benefiting from these strategic investments as revenue growth outpaced noninterest expense increases

refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  for a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate of percent to the effective tax rates for   and equity and capital resources shareholders equity ending was million compared to million at december  the ratio of shareholders equity to year end assets was percent for both and the growth in shareholders equity has been a function of the retention of earnings  the issuance of common stock in connection with the pee dee acquisition  and the exercise of stock options 
offsetting increases to shareholders equity are repurchases of common stock  which centura executes from time to time  and dividends to shareholders 
centura s common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol cbc 
at december   centura had approximately  shareholders and  shares outstanding 
annual cash dividends have consistently increased and have been paid without interruption over the past years 
generally  dividends are paid on or about the th day of the final month in the quarter 
for and  cash dividends paid were million and million  respectively  representing and on a per share basis  respectively 
of the cash dividends paid during  million were declared and accrued during the fourth quarter of first quarter dividends of million  or 
per share  were declared and accrued in the first quarter of on january   centura adopted sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
this statement established standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements 
comprehensive income includes all non owner changes in equity during a period and is divided into two broad classifications net income and other comprehensive income oci 
oci includes revenues  expenses  gains  and losses that are excluded from earnings under generally accepted accounting principles  such as the minimum pension liability adjustment and unrealized gains or losses on securities 
consistent with this statement  centura reports unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities and the minimum pension liability adjustment  net of tax  as separate components of shareholders equity classified under accumulated other comprehensive income 
centura s capital ratios are greater than the minimums required by regulatory guidelines 
it is centura s intent to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix 
at december   centura had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized 
total capital and tier i capital at december  were million and million  respectively 
note ii to the consolidated financial statements presents the capital ratios for centura and the bank for and as discussed in the liquidity section  capital securities are a component of tier i capital 
table capital ratios of centura total tier i tier i capital capital leverage minimum requirement regulatory agencies have generally taken the position not to include net unrealized gains or losses on investment securities in calculating tier capital 
as a result of its well capitalized status  the bank is assessed at the lowest fdic insurance premium rates available for financial institutions under each insurance fund 
centura has deposits insured under both of the fdic s insurance funds  the bif  and the saif 
on september   legislation was enacted to recapitalize the saif  which consisted of a one time special assessment on financial institutions that had or had acquired saif insured deposits in recent years 
the special saif assessment for centura of million  or million after tax  was expensed on september  liquidity centura s liquidity management objective is to meet maturing debt obligations  fund loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  and manage operations on a cost effective basis 
management believes that sufficient resources are available to meet centura s liquidity objective through its debt maturity structure  holdings of liquid assets  and access to the capital markets through a variety of funding vehicles 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that centura is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
investment securities are an important tool to centura s liquidity management objective 
securities held as afs constituted billion of the billion in securities held by centura at december  the securities represent an available source of liquidity through either repurchase programs or liquidation 
the bank s traditional funding sources consist primarily of established federal funds lines with major banks  proceeds from matured investments  principal repayments on loans  and core deposit growth 
at december   the bank had billion in total federal funds lines available 
in addition  the bank had the ability to borrow up to million from the fhlb  of which million was outstanding at year end the bank also has the ability to issue debt up to a maximum of million under an offering by the bank to institutional investors of unsecured bank notes due from days to years from the date of issue 
each bank note would be a direct  unconditional  and unsecured general obligation solely of the bank and would not be an obligation of or guaranteed by centura 
interest rate and maturity terms would be negotiated between the bank and the purchaser  within certain parameters set forth in the offering circular 
there were no bank notes outstanding at year end or in addition  centura also accepts eurodeposits  has a master note commercial paper facility  and offers brokered certificates of deposit 
the bank is currently in the process of renewing the note facility to increase the potential aggregate amount to billion and to issue million of ten year notes under that facility 
long term debt includes million of fixed rate  thirty year capital securities issued in june by ccti  a consolidated subsidiary of centura 
ccti issued million of common securities to centura 
ccti invested the proceeds of million  generated from the capital securities and common securities issuances  in fixed rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures junior debentures issued by centura 
the junior debentures  scheduled to mature in june  are the primary assets of ccti 
centura has guaranteed the obligations of ccti under the capital securities 
for risk based capital calculations  the capital securities are included as a component of tier i capital 
finally  centura has the ability to draw from an unsecured line of credit of up to million 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were outstanding under this line 
ii management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on centura s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations which  if implemented  would have a material effect on centura 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
centura s market risk primarily stems from interest rate risk  the potential economic loss due to future changes in interest rates  which is inherent in lending and deposit gathering activities 
centura s objective is to manage the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize interest rate risk and stabilize the net interest margin and the market value of equity while optimizing profit potential 
centura does not maintain a trading account nor is the corporation subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the table below illustrates the scheduled maturity of selected on balance sheet financial instruments and their estimated fair values at december  for loans  investment securities  and long term debt obligations  principal cashflows are presented by expected maturity date including the weighted average interest rate by exposure category 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at year end 
prepayment assumptions are based on rates evolving along the implied forward yield curve at year end and reflect market conventional prepayment behavior 
for deposits without contractual maturities  including interest checking  savings  and money market accounts  cashflows are separated into core and non core components 
the non core cashflows are scheduled to mature in while the core cashflows are presented based on management s assessment of runoff 
centura utilizes off balance sheet derivative financial instruments as one means of managing its interest rate risk associated with on balance sheet financial instruments

mismatches in interest rate repricings of assets and liabilities arise from the interaction of customer business needs and centura s discretionary asset and liability management activities 
exposure to changes in the level and direction of interest rates is managed by adjusting the asset liability mix through the use of various interest rate risk management products  including derivative financial instruments 
off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  interest rate floor and cap arrangements and interest rate futures and option contracts swaps  floors  caps  futures and options  respectively  are an integral part of centura s interest rate risk management activities 
centura has principally utilized interest rate swaps 
swaps are used to manage interest rate risk  reduce funding costs  and allow centura to utilize diversified funding sources 
floors are used to protect certain designated variable rate financial instruments from the downward effects of their repricing in the event of a decreasing rate environment 
caps are used to protect certain designated financial instruments from the negative repricing effects of an increasing rate environment 
options provide the right  but not obligation  to put or call securities back to a third party at an agreed upon price under the specific terms of each agreement

refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a comparative summary of centura s off balance sheet instruments at december  and and for a detailed discussion of related risks and to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the accounting policy for these off balance sheet financial instruments 
on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments are managed on an integrated basis as part of centura s overall asset liability management function 
the value of any single component of the on balance sheet or off balance sheet position should not be viewed independently

these simulations include calculating the impact of significant fluctuations in interest rates  both increases and decreases  on net interest income and the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities 
based on a basis point rate shock in either direction  this simulation as of december  shows centura s ii interest rate risk position to be relatively neutral net interest income would not vary by more than approximately percent and the estimated market value of equity would not vary by more than approximately percent 
centura seeks a reasonable balance between a satisfactorily high and stable return on average shareholders equity and a satisfactorily high and stable estimated market value of equity 
interest rate gap analysis is shown in table as of december  gap analysis is generally based on the timing of contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities including management s assumptions relative to financial instruments subject to prepayment and indeterminate life deposits 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
at december   centura had a negative one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap of approximately million 
the interest rate gap analysis is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment

the core component s principal cash flows are spread evenly over a year period 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
mortgages and mortgage backed securities principal cash flows are modeled by aggregating similar coupon and age instruments and applying the appropriate median prepayment speeds

net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by million  or percent  to million in  primarily due to the impact of average interest earning asset growth which exceeded interest bearing liability volume 
average interest earning assets increased million while interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the net interest margin decreased to percent during from percent during investments  which carry lower yields than loans  grew to represent a greater portion of interest earning assets during  negatively impacting the margin

operating leases  the investment in fghe and bank owned life insurance proceeds contributed an additional million to noninterest income 
noninterest expense for increased by percent to million compared to million in occupancy and equipment expense increased million and million respectively  reflecting the impact of a full year of expense related to ten supermarket locations opened in late  costs associated with twelve supermarket locations opened during  and the depreciation for equipment upgrades and enhancements

fees for outsourced services rose million to million for compared to million for centura outsources several functions including item processing  property management  and call processing generated from the centura highway 
the amortization of intangibles increased million in over due to the increased goodwill recorded for the acquisitions 
marketing expenses added an additional million to noninterest expense over as a result of centura s expanded customer base  the support of new markets  and an increased emphasis on target marketing customer segments 
year monitoring and managing the year project will result in additional nonrecurring expenditures 
direct costs include potential charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance  and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which are not enhanced 
in addition to the direct costs  indirect costs will also be incurred 
these indirect costs will consist principally of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products  and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
the emerging issues task force provided guidance concerning the accounting for the costs related to year modification 
the costs of the modifications should be treated as regular maintenance and repair and be charged to expense as incurred 
these direct and indirect costs are not expected to have a material effect on results of operations 
however  the distribution of year expenses between direct and indirect may change due to the allocation of internal resources 
including direct and indirect expenditures  management currently estimates that the total costs to become year compliant will range between and million 
the revised estimate since third quarter is a result of allocating a greater proportion of salary expense to year expense for those centura employees who are working to resolve the year issue there is no incremental increase to noninterest expense as a result of this allocation 
in total  centura has expensed approximately million related to year compliance efforts of which million was incurred during the year project cost estimates include the estimated costs and time associated with the assessment and monitoring of a third party s year risk  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which centura s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with centura s systems  would not have a material adverse effect ii on centura in future periods 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
current accounting issues in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the statement addresses accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and that those instruments be measured at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability  exposure to variable cashflows of a forecasted transaction or exposure of foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivatives and its resulting designation 
sfas is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  management has not yet assessed the impact of adoption of this statement 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for mortgage backed securities after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement amends sfas  accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  to require that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or other retained interest based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
this statement is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  management does not believe that adoption of this statement will materially impact the financial position of the bank 
the fasb also issues exposure drafts for proposed statements of financial accounting standards 
such exposure drafts are subject to comment from the public  to revisions by the fasb  and to final issuance by the fasb as statements of financial accounting standards 
management considers the effect of the proposed statements on the consolidated financial statements of centura and monitors the status of changes to issued exposure drafts and to proposed effective dates
