in fiscal  menswear wholesale sales were  while childrenswear wholesale sales were  in fiscal  menswear wholesale sales were  while childrenswear wholesale sales were  these increases were due to increases in volume  which resulted primarily from increased sales to existing customers  offset by a decrease in the average sales price per unit 
the increased sales to existing customers were partially the result of the company s in store shop and fixtured area expansion program  whereby certain of the company s customers have increased the amount of square footage where the company s products are featured 
net revenue in the company s retail division increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in the number of stores  as well as an increase in sales at existing stores  contributed to the improved revenue

this was partially offset by increased royalty and buying agency commissions  which produce higher margins than wholesale and retail operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is due to the leveraging of these expenses against the higher revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased volume related expenses of the company s wholesale and retail operations to support the higher revenue 
in addition  depreciation and amortization has increased due to the greater number of in store shops and fixtured areas 
the provision for taxes decreased to of income before taxes in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which the company s earnings are subject 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth of the business 
principally  this includes the purchase of inventory in anticipation of increased sales of the wholesale and retail divisions as well as capital expenditures related to the expansion of the company s in store shop and fixtured area programs and additional retail stores 
the company s sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations and the company s available credit 
additionally  the company required acquisition related financing in may as discussed further below 
the company s cash and cash equivalents balance increased from  at march  to  at march  this represented an overall increase of  due primarily to cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by cash used in investing activities 
a detailed analysis of the changes in cash and cash equivalents is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal  compared with  on an actual basis and  on a pro forma basis in fiscal significant capital expenditures included additions related to the company s flagship stores and in store shop and fixtured area expansion program 
at march   accrued expenses and other current liabilities included  of open letters of credit for inventory purchased 
additionally  at march   th usa was contingently liable for unexpired bank letters of credit of  related to commitments of th usa to suppliers for the purchase of inventories 
on may   the company acquired its womenswear  jeanswear and canadian licensees for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash and  ordinary shares of the company 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded from a combination of debt financing and cash on hand 
the debt financing portion of the purchase price consisted of  of notes maturing on june  the notes   of notes maturing on june  the notes and  of term loan borrowings pursuant to new  term and revolving credit facilities the credit facilities 
the notes and the notes collectively  the notes were issued by th usa and guaranteed by thc 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants that are more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the credit facilities  which are guaranteed by thc  consist of an unsecured  th usa five year revolving credit facility  of which up to  may be used for direct borrowings  and an unsecured  five year term loan facility which was borrowed by th usa in connection with the acquisition and remains outstanding at march  the term loan bears interest at variable rates which  on a weighted average basis  amounted to and as of  and for the period ended  march   respectively 
the revolving credit facility will be available for letters of credit  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facilities replaced the company s secured revolving credit agreement which had been in place since april  borrowings under the term loan facility are repayable in quarterly installments as follows  in the month period ending march    in each of the next two succeeding month periods  and  in the next succeeding month period 
under the credit facilities  subsidiaries of thc may not pay dividends or make other payments in respect of capital stock to thc that in the aggregate exceed of the company s cumulative consolidated net income  commencing with the fiscal year ended march   less certain deductions 
the credit facilities also contain a number of other restrictive covenants that are more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with all covenants in respect of the notes and the credit facilities as of march  the company attempts to mitigate the risks associated with adverse movements in interest rates by establishing and maintaining a favorable balance of fixed and floating rate debt and cash on hand 
management also believes that significant flexibility remains available in the form of additional borrowing capacity and the ability to prepay term debt  if so desired  in response to changing conditions in the debt markets 
because such flexibility exists  the company does not normally enter into specific hedging transactions to further mitigate interest rate risks  except in the case of specific  material borrowing transactions such as those associated with the acquisition 
no interest rate hedging contracts were in place as of march  there were no significant committed capital expenditures at march  the company expects fiscal capital expenditures to approximate  to  the company intends to fund such cash requirements for fiscal and future years from available cash balances  internally generated funds and borrowings available under the credit facilities 
the company believes that these resources will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements for such periods 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on its net revenue or profitability 
higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured but have not had a material effect on the company s net revenue or profitability 
the company has historically been able to partially offset its cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for substantially all of its product sales 
substantially all inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are also denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
the company does  however  seek to protect against adverse movements in foreign currency which might affect certain firm commitments or transactions 
these include the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures and the collection of certain foreign receivables 
the company enters into forward contracts with maturities of up to one year to sell or purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against such risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
no significant gain or loss was inherent in such contracts at march  while a hypothetical adverse change in all of the relevant exchange rates would potentially cause a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately  the company would experience an offsetting benefit in the spot rate on the associated underlying transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas 
it is expected that sfas will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management of the company anticipates that  due to the limited use of derivative instruments  the nature of such instruments and the nature of the underlying transactions being hedged  the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
year during the year ended march   the company initiated a comprehensive program to evaluate and address the impact of the year on its operations and those of the acquired companies in order to ensure that its computer systems properly recognize calendar year this program included steps to identify each item or element that would require date code remediation and make appropriate modifications to ensure a seamless transition to the year the company has now completed the major portion of its internal date remediation activity 
the company is using internal staff resources to accomplish most of this activity and estimates that the cost will not exceed certain other costs  which are capitalized  represent investment in new hardware and software systems upgrades  the timing of which was planned to coincide with the integration of the acquired companies 
principal among these is a new investment in packaged financial systems software to which the company and its major subsidiaries converted during such costs represent only a nominal percentage of capital expenditures 
the estimate of costs of the year compliance effort and the timetable for internal year modifications are management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will prove accurate and actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
based upon progress to date  however  the company believes that it is unlikely that actual results would differ significantly from the estimates 
the company is also corresponding with significant suppliers  customers  transportation carriers and general service providers whose computer systems functionality could impact the company and in particular its ability to schedule forward production and procurement of merchandise from suppliers and to fulfill customer orders 
these communications will facilitate coordination of year conversions and will additionally permit the company to determine its exposure to the failure of third parties to address their own year issues 
although the company is not aware of any material issues that would impede its ability to prepare its internal systems for the year  and therefore has not prepared a contingency plan  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s processes rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to successfully convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the need for contingency plans in this regard will continue to be assessed
