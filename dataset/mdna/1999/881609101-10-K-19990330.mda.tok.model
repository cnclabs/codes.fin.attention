item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in the management s discussion and analysis that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page for discussion of the factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements 
general the company s strategy is to i maximize earnings  cash flows and return on capital employed and increase the competitiveness of each of its business units by reducing costs  increasing operating efficiencies and optimizing existing assets and ii expand its overall market presence through a combination of internal growth initiatives and selective acquisitions which are both accretive to earnings and provide significant operational synergies 
the company plans to further improve profitability in the refining and marketing segment by enhancing processing capabilities  strengthening marketing channels and improving supply and transportation functions 
improved profitability has positioned the marine services segment to participate in the consolidation of the industry by pursuing opportunities for expansion  as well as optimizing existing operations 
in the exploration and production segment  the strategy focuses on generating and operating exploration projects in an effort to diversify its oil and gas production and reserve base 
selectively  the company uses acquisitions and enhanced technical capabilities 
the company has made significant progress in diversifying its us operations to areas other than the bob west field and has taken steps to begin serving emerging markets in south america 
as part of this strategy  the company completed the following refining and marketing acquisitions during on may   the company completed the acquisition the hawaii acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of bhp petroleum americas refining inc and bhp petroleum south pacific inc 
together  bhp hawaii from bhp hawaii inc and bhp petroleum pacific islands inc  affiliates of the broken hill proprietary company limited bhp 
the hawaii acquisition included a  barrel per day refinery the hawaii refinery and retail gasoline stations located in hawaii 
tesoro paid million in cash for the hawaii acquisition  including million for working capital 
in addition  tesoro issued an unsecured  non interest bearing  promissory note for the purchase in the amount of million  payable in five equal annual installments of million each  beginning in on august   the company completed the acquisition the washington acquisition and together with the hawaii acquisition  the acquisitions of all of the outstanding stock of shell anacortes refining company shell washington  an affiliate of shell oil company 
the washington acquisition included a  barrel per day refinery the washington refinery in anacortes  washington and related assets 
the total cash purchase price for the washington acquisition was million  including million for working capital 
the acquisitions are expected to triple tesoro s historical annual revenues and significantly increase the scope of its refining and marketing operations 
the acquisitions had a positive impact on earnings and cash flows in the fourth quarter of  and management expects that the acquisitions will add to earnings and cash flows in management believes that there are significant cost saving and revenue enhancement opportunities available by integrating the hawaii and washington refineries with the alaskan operations and has identified approximately million of potential annual cost saving and revenue enhancing synergies 
management expects to realize the full annual impact of such synergies during the company will continue to pursue other opportunities that are operationally and geographically complementary with its asset base 
in conjunction with the acquisitions and refinancing of its then existing indebtedness refinancing in  the company issued equity and debt securities providing the company with million of net proceeds and entered into a million senior credit facility senior credit facility 
for information related to the financings  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item business environment the company operates in an environment where its earnings and cash flows are sensitive to volatile changes in energy prices 
fluctuations in the cost of crude oil used for refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products can result in changes in margins from the refining and marketing operations  as prices received for refined products may or may not keep pace with changes in crude oil costs 
these energy prices  together with volume levels  also determine the carrying value of crude oil and refined product inventory 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories of crude oil and us wholesale refined products in its refining and marketing segment 
this method results in inventory carrying amounts that are less likely to represent current values and in costs of sales which more closely represent current costs 
if  however  fluctuations in market prices cause the market value of inventories to fall below their lifo cost  the company would write down its inventories to estimated realizable value 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices also influence the level of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
the company s marine services segment  whose customers include offshore drilling contractors and related industries  can be impacted by significant fluctuations in natural gas  condensate and oil prices 
the company s marine services segment uses the first in  first out fifo method of accounting for inventories of fuels 
changes in fuel prices can significantly impact inventory valuations and costs of sales in this segment 
changes in natural gas  condensate and oil prices impact revenues and the present value of estimated future net revenues and cash flows from the company s exploration and production segment 
the company may increase or decrease its natural gas production in response to market conditions 
the carrying costs of oil and gas assets are subject to noncash write downs based on decreases in natural gas and oil prices and other determining factors 
in  the company recorded a million noncash write down of its oil and gas properties 
it is reasonably possible that the present value of proved oil and gas reserves could be significantly reduced during the first quarter of due to further decreases in natural gas and oil prices since year end 
this could result in further write downs of the company s oil and gas properties 
results of operations summary tesoro s net loss for was million  compared with net earnings of million and million in and  respectively 
in and  the company incurred aftertax extraordinary losses of million and million  respectively  for early extinguishments of debt 
results before extraordinary losses amounted to a loss of million in and earnings of million and million in and  respectively

when comparing with  after excluding significant items  the million improvement in net earnings was primarily attributable to better refined product margins  higher spot market natural gas prices and lower interest expense 
net earnings per share  after excluding significant items  would have been per basic share diluted for  compared with per basic share diluted in and per basic and diluted share in on a per share basis  the company s results for were reduced by dividends on preferred stock and the impact of issuing additional shares of common stock during the year 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes  together with the following discussion and analysis  are intended to provide shareholders and other investors with a reasonable basis for assessing the company s operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting the future performance of the company

b sales and manufactured volumes for included amounts from the acquired hawaii and washington operations since the acquisition dates  averaged over the full year 
refinery throughput for included volumes from the hawaii and washington refineries  averaged over the periods owned since acquisition 
c sources of total product sales included products manufactured at the company s refineries  products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties 
d gross margins on product sales included margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes 
compared with segment operating profit from the refining and marketing operations totaled million in  an increase of million from segment operating profit of million in the increase in segment operating profit was primarily due to higher throughput and sales volumes  primarily from the acquired refineries see note c to consolidated financial statements in item  and improved refined product yields in alaska 
financial results from the acquired operations have been included since the dates of acquisition 
the hawaii acquisition was completed on may   and the washington acquisition was completed on august  the acquisitions contributed positively to the segment s operating profit in  however  on a consolidated basis  these results were largely offset by corporate interest and financing costs 
during  the company s refined product yields in alaska benefitted from an expansion of the hydrocracker unit completed in october the expansion  which increased the unit s capacity by approximately  enables production of more jet fuel 
segment results were favorably impacted by this expansion beginning in the fourth quarter of during  average throughput at the alaska refinery increased by  barrels per day  a increase over which included a day maintenance turnaround 
production of jet fuel at this refinery increased by approximately over due to the hydrocracker expansion and higher throughput levels 
the alaska hydrocracker expansion and the acquisitions contributed to an increase in the proportion of higher value gasoline and middle distillates manufactured by the company in conversely  the proportion of lower value heavy oils and residual products manufactured by the company decreased in the higher value mix of product partly offset market pressures which decreased year to year refinery product spreads to per barrel in from per barrel in increased gross margins of per barrel in  which compare to per barrel in  reflected the higher value mix of manufactured product and a reduction in products purchased and resold 
in  products from the company s refineries accounted for approximately of its sales volume  compared with in  enabling the company to reduce the amounts of products purchased from others which generally sell at lower margins 
revenues from sales of refined products in the refining and marketing segment increased during primarily due to the higher sales volumes from the acquisitions  partially offset by lower sales prices 
export sales of refined products increased to million in  compared with million in  primarily due to sales from hawaii to asia partly offset by a decrease in exports from the alaska refinery to the far east 
other revenues included crude oil resales of million in compared to million in merchandise sales  also included in other revenues  increased in due to the hawaii acquisition which included company operated retail stations 
the increase in costs of sales reflected higher volumes associated with the acquisitions  partly offset by lower feedstock prices 
margins from non refinery activities increased to million in  compared with million in  primarily due to the higher merchandise sales 
operating expenses and depreciation and amortization were higher in primarily due to the acquisitions 
with the acquisitions of the hawaii and washington refineries  enhancements of product mix and expansion of market areas  the company has improved the fundamental earnings potential of this segment 
management plans to further improve profitability by enhancing processing capabilities  strengthening marketing channels and improving supply and transportation functions 
the ability to supply these expanded markets with a higher proportion of manufactured products  rather than purchased products  is also expected to improve profitability 
future profitability of this segment  however  will continue to be influenced by market conditions  particularly as these conditions influence costs of crude oil relative to prices received for sales of refined products  and other additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
compared with the refining and marketing segment s operating profit of million in increased million from operating profit of million in the improvement was due in part to the company s initiatives to enhance its product slate  improve efficiencies and sell a larger portion of the alaska refinery s production within the core alaska market 
the expansion of the hydrocracker unit discussed above began to favorably impact this segment s results in the fourth quarter of in october  the company began purchasing approximately  barrels per day of cook inlet crude oil in addition to the  barrels per day under previously existing contracts 
during  the company s production of refined products increased by 
the operational changes  discussed above  resulted in an increase in the production of higher value middle distillates  primarily jet fuel  while production of lower value heavy oils  residual products and other increased by 
the improved product slate  which better matches the company s product supply with demand in alaska  reflected a change of the hydrocracker catalyst in late  as well as the hydrocracker expansion and catalyst change in late the company s sales of refined products within alaska increased by in  contributing to higher product margins 
the improved product slate and marketing efforts  together with generally favorable industry conditions  resulted in an increase in the company s refinery spread to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in both years included scheduled day maintenance turnarounds 
revenues from sales of refined products in the refining and marketing segment increased during  reflecting a increase in sales volumes  partially offset by slightly lower average sales prices 
total refined product sales averaged  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in other revenues  which included crude oil resales of million in and million in  declined due to lower sales volumes and prices 
the company had less crude oil available for resale in as throughput at the alaska refinery increased by  barrels per day  or  from export sales of refined products  including sales to russia  amounted to million in  compared to million in costs of sales decreased in due to lower spot purchases of crude oil and lower prices 
margins from non refinery activities decreased to million in due primarily to lower margins on refined product purchased for resale 
operating expenses and other increased in due primarily to higher employee costs  professional fees and marketing expenses 
marine services dollars in millions gross operating revenues fuels lubricants and other services gross operating revenues costs of sales gross profit operating expenses and other depreciation and amortization segment operating profit sales volumes millions of gallons fuels  primarily diesel lubricants capital expenditures compared with gross operating revenues decreased from million in to million in  reflecting a million decline in fuel revenues from lower market prices partly offset by a increase in fuel sales volumes 
the increase in fuel volumes was attributable to operations in the gulf of mexico and the transfer of three west coast terminals from the company s refining and marketing segment to marine services in january the decrease in costs of sales also reflected lower fuel prices  partly offset by increased volumes 
gross profit  which improved by million due to higher volumes  was partly offset by additional operating expenses from the west coast terminals and higher depreciation and amortization resulting from upgrades to facilities 
despite lower rig activity in the gulf of mexico  total segment operating profit increased by million largely due to the company s ability to emphasize customer service  control expenses and increase sales volumes 
profitability of the marine services segment can be affected significantly by the level of oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity in the gulf of mexico 
with depressed oil and gas prices continuing into  exploration and production activity in the gulf of mexico has significantly declined 
while the company s marine services segment has taken initiatives to be a low cost provider and has expanded its operations into the west coast  its operating results will be adversely impacted by reduced sales volumes and pressure on margins in the near term 
compared with gross operating revenues increased by million  which included a million increase in fuels and lubricant revenues and a million increase in service revenues 
the increase in fuels and lubricant revenues reflected a increase in sales volumes  partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in service revenue was due in part to increased rig activity in the gulf of mexico and the company s focus to serve these customers 
additional terminal locations stemming from an acquisition in february together with internal growth initiatives have enabled the company to increase its sales activity 
costs of sales increased in due to the higher volumes 
the improvement of million in gross profit was largely offset by higher operating and other expenses associated with the increased activity and higher depreciation and amortization expense

net natural gas production sold under the contract averaged approximately mmcf per day in operating profit for included million from the excess of these contract prices over spot market prices 
upon termination of the contract  the company recorded other income and operating profit of million during the fourth quarter of see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements in item c operating profit for included income from receipt of million from an operator in the bob west field  representing funds that were no longer needed as a contingency reserve for litigation 
d includes effect of the company s natural gas commodity price agreements which amounted to a gain of per mcf in and to losses of per mcf in and per mcf in exploration and production us compared with segment operating profit from the company s us exploration and production operations was million  compared with million in comparability between these years was impacted by certain significant items 
results for included income from receipt of million from an operator in the bob west field  representing funds that were no longer needed as a contingency reserve for litigation  and a write down of its domestic oil and gas properties of million 
in  the company recognized income of million for retroactive severance tax refunds 
excluding these significant items  segment operating profit decreased by million in primarily due to lower prices  higher depletion and increased production costs 
gross operating revenues from the company s us operations decreased by million as lower sale prices generally offset higher production volumes 
prices realized by the company on its natural gas production declined to per mcf in from per mcf in the company s us production averaged mmcfe per day in  compared with mmcfe per day in the mmcfe per day increase consisted of a mmcfe per day increase in production from outside the bob west field  partially offset by a mmcfe per day decline at the bob west field 
production from outside the bob west field provided of the company s total production in  compared to in total production costs increased million  to million in from million in on a per unit basis  total production costs increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in production costs from outside the bob west field increased by million due to the higher volumes from these newer fields  but on a per unit basis  production costs from these fields declined to per mcfe in from per mcfe in production costs at the bob west field decreased by million due to the decline in volumes which resulted in an increase in the per unit cost to per mcfe in from per mcfe in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  due to a higher depletion rate and increased production volumes 
the higher depletion rate of per mcfe in  compared to per mcfe in  was due  in part  to the company s emphasis on exploration  which accounted for more than half of the total drilling costs in the company s million write down of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  which was required by the cost ceiling limitation under full cost accounting  was primarily the result of declines in oil and gas prices during the fourth quarter of although the effect of the write down resulted in a noncash charge to operating profit in  it will positively impact future earnings through lower depletion rates  beginning in the first quarter of the year end write down reduced amortizable domestic costs by 
it is reasonably possible that further decreases in oil and natural gas prices since year end may cause the company to reduce its capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in the near term 
for information related to natural gas commodity price agreements  see item a contained herein 
compared with segment operating profit from the company s us exploration and production operations was million in  compared with million in comparability between these years was impacted by several major transactions in  including the favorable resolution in august of litigation regarding the tennessee gas contract and the termination of the remainder of the contract effective october  as provided for in the tennessee gas contract  which was to expire in january  the company was selling a portion of the gas produced in the bob west field pursuant to a contract price  which was above the average spot market price 
in total  during  the company received approximately million in cash for the resolution of litigation and termination of the tennessee gas contract  with the company s exploration and production segment recording other income of million upon termination of the contract 
in  the exploration and production segment s operating profit also included million from the excess of tennessee gas contract prices over spot market prices 
see notes e and f of notes to consolidated financial statements in item additionally  during  substantially all of the company s proved producing reserves in the bob west field were certified by the texas railroad commission as high cost gas from a designated tight formation  eligible for state severance tax exemptions from the date of first production through august accordingly  no severance tax is recorded on current production from the exempt wells in the bob west field beginning in in and  the company recognized income of million and million  respectively  for retroactive severance tax refunds for production in prior years 
excluding the impact of the incremental contract value and income from the severance tax refunds  segment operating profit from the company s us operations would have been million in compared with million in the resulting increase of million was primarily attributable to higher spot market prices for natural gas sales  partially offset by higher depletion and operating expenses 
prices realized by the company on its natural gas production sold in the spot market increased to per mcf in from per mcf in the company s weighted average sales price  which includes the above market pricing of the tennessee gas contract in  decreased in due to the termination of the contract 
the company s net production averaged mmcfe per day in  a decrease of mmcfe per day from this decrease consisted of a mmcfe per day decline from the bob west field  largely offset by a mmcfe per day increase from other us fields 
gross operating revenues from the company s us operations  after excluding amounts related to tennessee gas  increased due to the higher spot market prices 
production costs were higher by million per mcfe mainly due to costs at the bob west field 
administrative support and other operating expenses decreased by million 
depreciation and depletion increased by million  or  due to a higher depletion rate 
exploration and production bolivia compared with segment operating results for the company s bolivian operations decreased to a loss of million  compared to operating profit of million in results for included a million write down of the bolivian oil and gas properties  while results for included million of income related to the collection of a receivable for production in prior years 
excluding the write down in and other income in  segment operating profit for would have been million compared to million in the decrease of million in segment operating profit was primarily due to the decline in bolivian natural gas prices  which are contractually indexed to posted new york fuel oil prices 
natural gas prices fell to per mcf in from per mcf in condensate prices also fell to per barrel in from per barrel in net production volumes  however  increased to mmcfe per day from mmcfe per day 
the company s share of net production increased in as a result of the july buyout of interests held by its former joint venture participant  and the remaining production difference resulted in part from production constraints in arising from repairs to a third party pipeline that transports gas from bolivia to argentina 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization was due to the higher production volumes and a higher depletion rate 
the company s million write down of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  which was required by the cost ceiling limitation under full cost accounting  was primarily the result of declines in oil and gas prices during the fourth quarter of although the effect of the write down resulted in a noncash charge to operating profit in  it will positively impact future earnings through lower depletion rates  beginning in the first quarter of the year end write down reduced amortizable bolivian costs by 
it is reasonably possible that further decreases in oil and natural gas prices since year end may cause the company to reduce its capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in the near term 
compared with segment operating profit from the company s bolivian operations decreased to million in from million in results for benefited from income of million related to the collection of a receivable for prior years production 
without this income  segment operating profit would have decreased by million in due to declines in natural gas and condensate production and prices 
with the company s purchase of interests held by its former joint venture participant in july  the company s share of production from bolivia increased by approximately beginning in the third quarter see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
however  early in  the company s bolivian natural gas production was lower due to a reduction in minimum takes under the contract between yacimientos petroliferos fiscales ypfb and yacimientos petroliferos fiscales ypf and also due to constraints arising from repairs to a third party pipeline that transports gas from bolivia to argentina 
in addition  during  production was higher due to requests from ypfb for additional production from the company to meet export specifications 
natural gas prices fell to per mcf in  compared with per mcf in condensate prices fell to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in other factors 
the company s bolivia natural gas is currently sold to ypfb  a bolivian government agency  which in turn sells the natural gas to ypf  a publicly held company based in argentina 
currently  the company s sale of natural gas production is based on the volume and pricing terms in a take or pay contract argentina contract between ypfb and ypf 
the argentina contract s primary term ends march   and has been extended an additional five months to august  the company s share of the minimum contract volumes from the argentina contract are mmcf per day gross net through march  and mmcf per day gross net from april through august a lack of market access has constrained natural gas production in bolivia 
management believes that a third party   mile pipeline from bolivia to brazil  which is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of  will provide access to potentially larger gas consuming markets 
pipeline sales will be governed by a year take or pay contract brazil contract between ypfb and petroleo brasileiro  sa petrobras 
initial brazilian demand estimates are approximately mmcf per day and are expected to increase to the mmcf per day level by the end of tesoro has a preferential right to of the first mmcf per day sold under the brazil contract 
for incremental demand above mmcf per day  petrobras  in its capacity as a producer  has a preferential right to sell production from its bolivian wells 
during march  petrobras exercised its preferential right for of the first increment of mmcf per day of gas to be sold beginning in and for of the second increment of mmcf per day of gas to be sold beginning in excluding petrobras preferential right for gas volumes in excess of mmcf per day  remaining gas sales will be allocated by ypfb to the other producers according to a number of factors  including each producer s reserve volumes and production capacity 
although the new bolivia to brazil pipeline creates the potential for increased tesoro gas sales  tesoro cannot be assured that it will be able to maintain its approximate historical market share for gas sold in excess of mmcf per day 
in bolivia  the company s reserves are classified by the government as either existing or new hydrocarbons depending upon whether they were in production prior to may  existing hydrocarbons or after that date new hydrocarbons 
existing hydrocarbons are subject to a royalty to ypfb  plus bolivian taxes that are equal to an additional of gross revenues 
new hydrocarbons are subject to a more favorable tax treatment 
new hydrocarbons are subject to a tax equal to of gross revenues plus of net income  and there is no royalty paid to ypfb 
under certain circumstances  new hydrocarbons may be subject to additional taxes 
during  the company paid taxes of million to the bolivian government which are netted against the income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations in item hereof 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the million increase in was primarily due to higher employee costs and professional fees partly due to the design and implementation of an integrated enterprise wide software system 
system design and implementation will continue in phases until all system modules are implemented by the fourth quarter of when comparing to  the increase was primarily due to higher employee costs  partially offset by lower professional fees and insurance costs 
interest and financing costs interest and financing costs totaled million in  compared with million in and million in the million increase in was primarily due to higher borrowings under the company s credit arrangements  including the new senior credit facility  and the issuance of debt securities which were used to fund the acquisitions and the refinancing and to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
when comparing with  the million decrease in interest and financing costs reflected the interest savings from redemption of million in debt during november interest income interest income was million in  compared with million in and million in in  interest income included approximately million received from tennessee gas in conjunction with the collection of a receivable which resulted from underpayment for natural gas sold in prior periods see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
other operating costs and other expenses other expense totaled million in  compared with million in and million in in  the company incurred a charge for special incentive compensation which was earned in the second quarter when the market price of the company s common stock achieved a specific performance target 
this charge totaled million  of which million related to operating segment employees 
there were no material comparable charges recorded in when comparing to  the decrease in other expense was due to costs incurred in of million to resolve a shareholder consent solicitation  together with a write off of deferred financing costs and expenses related to former operations 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements in item income tax provision the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in  compared with income tax provisions of million in and million in the income tax benefit in was due to the company s loss in  but was largely offset by bolivian taxes

capital resources and liquidity overview the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under a revolving line of credit 
capital requirements are expected to include capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and preferred dividend requirements 
based upon current and anticipated needs  management believes that available capital resources will be adequate to meet anticipated future capital requirements 
the company operates in an environment where its liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in price  supply and demand for crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  market uncertainty and a variety of additional risks that are beyond the control of the company 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  the proximity of the company s natural gas reserves to pipelines  the capacities of such pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall market and economic conditions 
the company s future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under its credit arrangements and other sources of capital  will be affected by these conditions 
capitalization during  the company invested million in the acquisitions and spent an additional million on natural gas property additions and other capital projects 
these investing activities  together with the refinancing  were funded with net proceeds of million from equity and debt offerings  cash flows from operations of million and borrowings under term loans and revolving credit lines 
at december   the company s total debt to capitalization ratio was 
major changes in the company s capitalization during were as follows the issuance of  premium income equity securities pies  representing fractional interests in the company s mandatorily convertible preferred stock preferred stock  provided the company with gross proceeds of million 
holders of pies are entitled to receive a cash dividend 
the pies will automatically convert into shares of common stock on july   at a rate based upon a formula dependent upon the market price of common stock at the time of conversion 
before july   each pies is convertible  at the option of the holder thereof  into shares of common stock  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the issuance of  shares of common stock provided the company with gross proceeds of million 
the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes senior subordinated notes provided the company with million of net proceeds 
the senior subordinated notes mature in  without sinking fund requirements  and are subject to optional redemption by the company after five years at declining premiums 
the indenture for the senior subordinated notes contains covenants and restrictions which are customary for notes of this nature 
these covenants and restrictions are less restrictive than those under the senior credit facility  discussed below 
substantially all of the company s existing indebtedness at may   including an obligation to the state of alaska and loans which were used to improve the alaska refinery  were refinanced in the company entered into a million senior credit facility  comprised of term loans aggregating million and a revolving credit and letter of credit facility aggregating million  which bear interest at variable rates 
this facility replaced an interim credit facility which was entered into in may to complete the hawaii acquisition and the refinancing  to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes 
the interim credit facility replaced the company s previous corporate revolving credit agreement 
for further information on the senior credit facility  see credit arrangements discussed below 
as part of the hawaii acquisition  the company issued an unsecured  non interest bearing promissory note bhp note in the amount of million  payable in five equal annual installments of million each  beginning the bhp note provides for early payments based upon achievement of a specified level of cash flows from the acquired assets 
the senior credit facility  senior subordinated notes and pies impose various restrictions and covenants on the company that could potentially limit the company s ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for anticipated capital investments  to raise additional debt or equity capital or to take advantage of business opportunities 
for further information on the company s capital structure  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item credit arrangements during july  the company entered into the senior credit facility  comprised of term loans aggregating million term loans and a revolving credit and letter of credit facility aggregating million revolver 
the senior credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the company s active direct and indirect subsidiaries guarantors and is secured by substantially all of the domestic assets of the company and each of the guarantors 
at december   the company had outstanding borrowings of million under the term loans and million under the revolver 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million at year end 
unused availability under the senior credit facility and term loans was approximately million at december  on january   the final million tranche under the term loans was borrowed and used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolver 
the revolver terminates in july  while the term loans mature over varying periods through the end of the senior credit facility requires the company to maintain specified levels of consolidated leverage and interest coverage and contains other covenants and restrictions customary in credit arrangements of this kind 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  future compliance with financial covenants under the senior credit facility is primarily dependent on the company s cash flows and levels of borrowings under the revolver 
based on market conditions in the first quarter of  including depressed natural gas prices and downturn in refinery margins  continued compliance with such covenants is not assured 
if the company is not able to continue to comply with its financial covenants  it will be required to seek waivers or amendments from its lenders 
if such an event occurs  management of the company believes that it will be able to obtain waivers and or negotiate terms and conditions with its lenders under the senior credit facility which will allow the company to adequately finance its operations

for further information on environmental contingencies  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements in item year readiness disclosure the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent on its computer hardware  operating systems and software programs collectively  systems and programs 
these systems and programs are used in several key areas of the company s business  including production and distribution  information management services and financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the goal of the company s year project is to prevent any disruption to the company s business processes or its ability to conduct business resulting from year computer issues 
the year may cause problems in systems that use dates 
many systems such as computers  computer applications  process equipment used in refineries  phone systems  and electrical components have embedded chips that are subject to failure 
failures result from the practice of representing the year as a digit number  and then treating as the year  not other failures may result if the year is not recognized as a leap year 
disruptions may also be caused by computer failures of external sources such as vendors  service providers and customers 
to identify and eliminate potential disruptions  the company developed a year compliance plan compliance plan with respect to those systems and programs that are deemed to be critical to the company s operations and safety 
the compliance plan  which covers information technology it and non it aspects  is divided into the following sections plant facilities includes non it embedded systems such as process control systems  environmental systems and the physical equipment and facilities at the company s exploration and production locations  refineries and transportation vessels  business systems includes it hardware  software  and network systems serving the company s business units  office facilities includes telephone  security  and office equipment and external sources customers  suppliers and vendors 
implementation of the compliance plan is led by an oversight committee  made up of representatives from each of the company s major facilities 
the compliance plan is monitored weekly and progress is reported to management and the board of directors 
the compliance plan includes the following phases and scheduled completion dates scheduled complete completion date awareness establish a year team and develop a detailed plan complete assessment identify critical business processes and systems that must be modified  assess and prioritize risk factors complete remediation convert  replace or eliminate hardware and software july validation test and verify july implementation put new and renovated systems into production  monitor and continually evaluate july contingency plans develop contingency plans for critical items that cannot be tested september the company has utilized both internal and external resources in evaluating its systems and programs  as well as manual processes  external interfaces with customers and services supplied by vendors  to identify potential year compliance problems 
the company has identified and is replacing a number of systems and programs that are not year compliant 
based on current information  the company expects to attain year compliance and complete appropriate testing of its modifications and replacements in advance of the year date change 
modification or replacement of the company s systems and programs is being performed in house by company personnel and external consultants 
the company believes that  with hardware replacement and modifications to existing software or conversions to new software  the year date change will not pose a significant operational problem for the company 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  interdependent  it is possible that non compliant third party computer systems or programs may not interface properly with the company s computer systems 
the company has requested assurance from third parties that their computers  systems or programs be year compliant 
approximately  questionnaires were sent to vendors who were identified as providing goods and services to the company s operations 
vendors were asked questions relating to their year preparation and readiness 
over half of the vendors either returned the questionnaire or were contacted and interviewed personally 
of those contacted  none could foresee that they would have a problem with the delivery of goods or services on or after january  efforts will continue to contact the remaining critical vendors by june the utility companies providing electricity and water to the company s various locations were contacted and questioned about their ability to provide uninterrupted service and have all responded positively 
the company is in the process of contacting key customers to determine their year preparation and readiness 
this effort is expected to be completed by june although the effort of contacting key customers and vendors is not complete  management believes that the company s risk is minimal as it relates to key vendors and suppliers 
the company expects that expenses and capital expenditures associated with the year compliance project will not have a material effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company spent approximately million in and expects to spend million in to become year compliant 
the costs of year compliance are the best estimates of the company s management and are believed to be reasonably accurate 
in the event the compliance plan is not successfully or timely implemented  the company may need to devote more resources to the process and additional costs may be incurred 
the costs of implementing the integrated enterprise wide system are excluded as this system implementation was undertaken primarily to improve business processes 
if the company were not able to satisfactorily complete its compliance plan  including identifying and resolving problems encountered by the company s external service providers  potential consequences could include  among other things  unit downtime at  or damage to  the company s refineries  gas stations  terminal facilities and pipelines  delays in transporting refinery feedstocks and refined products  reduction in natural gas production  impairment of relationships with significant suppliers or customers  loss of accounting data or delays in processing such data  and loss of or delays in internal and external communications 
the occurrence of any or all of the above could result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
although the company currently believes that it will satisfactorily complete its compliance plan prior to january   there can be no assurance that it will be completed by such time or that the year problem will not adversely affect the company and its business
