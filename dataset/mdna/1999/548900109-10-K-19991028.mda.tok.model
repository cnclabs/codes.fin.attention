item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the relative percentages that certain items of income and expense bear to net sales years ended july  percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and administrative severance and merger costs research and development operating income loss interest expense other  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss demand for the company s products is seasonal with approximately to of its sales and a majority of its net income usually occurring in the third quarter february  march  and april 
during this period  the company s customers purchase the company s products so that the products will be available to sport fishermen and recreational boat owners for the peak fishing and boating season 
generally  with the exception of the third quarter  quarterly results are dependent on the timing and acceptance of new product introductions  advertising  and product availability  and as such  the company does not experience any consistent quarterly trends for those three quarters

  fourth quarter may july  total for year   demand for the company s products is affected by the rapidly changing technological environment of consumer electronics 
if the company fails to anticipate technological innovations advanced by its competitors and introduce technologically competitive products  demand for the company s products will diminish 
in each of the past three fiscal years  new product sales have accounted for more than of total sales 
additionally  sales of the company s products are affected by adverse changes in economic conditions  increased oil prices or adverse weather conditions 
the company believes that the lower priced and easier to use lcd sonar products available in recent years attracted an increased number of less serious fishermen to the marketplace who are more likely to reduce their purchase of sonar products during adverse economic conditions and or prolonged adverse weather conditions 
the company believes that the sonar market in the united states and canada is mature  with no significant growth in boating or fishing participation in recent years 
any opportunity for growth in these markets will rely on the ability of the company to increase its market share 
some market growth for sonar products is anticipated as related to international markets as the company continues to focus efforts in these areas 
international sales for decreased from by million 
canadian and australian sales were down  and all other international sales decreased  primarily because of weak economic conditions in several key international markets and increased competition 
the total market for gps products  both domestic and international  is expected to continue to expand 
the company s future success in gps is heavily dependent upon keeping pace with competitors who are rapidly introducing new products and new pricing strategies in the increasingly competitive marketplace 
accordingly  the company s future sales could be adversely affected by a reduction in consumer spending  a decline in recreational boating and sport fishing resulting from significant increases in oil prices  or new product introductions by competitors 
sales of sonar products including combination sonar gps units were up 
million from fiscal to  following a decrease of million from fiscal to the increase in sonar sales when comparing to results from generally favorable weather conditions during the peak selling season and the effect of three new sonar models which began shipping during the second quarter of fiscal the decline in sonar sales when comparing to results from a generally poor retail selling season due to adverse weather conditions  as well as the company s significantly reduced advertising expenditures and reduced tradeshow activity  and the effects of price increases on certain sonar models 
sales of gps products decreased million from fiscal to and decreased million from fiscal to the decrease in gps sales for both years results from increased competition at lower price points and significant reductions in advertising and marketing efforts 
the company s production of its products is scheduled on the basis of sales forecasts rather than actual orders 
products are designed and manufactured and parts are ordered in advance of the peak sales period so that products can be shipped within days of receipt of customers orders 
the company s profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to accurately forecast and plan for market demand for its products in advance of the peak selling season and to meet the demand of the peak sales months with technologically acceptable products at acceptable prices 
the company begins planning for sales during each fiscal year in february or march of the preceding year 
the planning includes the preparation of an annual sales forecast for the upcoming fiscal year 
the forecast is reviewed by the company at least monthly  and if necessary  the forecast is revised 
the forecast of products must allow time for ordering raw materials and parts  which may take as long as five months for delivery following the company s order  and for manufacturing so that the company has a build up of finished goods inventory sufficient to meet demand prior to the peak sales months 
failure by the company to accurately forecast market trends  introduction of technological advancements  or the demand for particular models can result in a build up of raw material and finished goods inventory that is obsolete or must be liquidated at reduced prices 
the build up of raw material and finished goods inventory in anticipation of orders during the peak selling season  cash outlays required to purchase tooling to manufacture new products  together with extended payment terms of up to days offered by the company which historically result in a significant increase in working capital requirements from a low in june through august to a high in september through december 
the company uses a material requirements planning mrp system to control inventory by eliminating stockpiling and by utilizing a continuous flow method of manufacturing 
under the continuous flow method of manufacturing  parts and supplies are ordered and scheduled for purchase and delivery only at such time as they are expected to be needed in the manufacturing process 
the mrp system also results in a reduction of the company s safety stock and a shorter manufacturing cycle 
however  extenuating circumstances can and do occur which render a mrp system ineffective at controlling inventory levels 
such circumstances were experienced during and are discussed below in working capital 
the following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the financial condition and operating results of the company for fiscal years through reference should also be made to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
results of operations net sales net sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal all of the sales decrease was the result of a decline in unit sales as the average price per unit was unchanged 
the decrease in unit sales resulted from a decline in sales of the company s lower priced portable and gimble mount gps navigation products 
increased sales of sonar units partially offset the decline in gps navigation units 
the decline in gps navigation units results from increased competition  particularly at the entry level price points below  and limited spending on advertising and marketing 
sonar sales increased due to favorable weather conditions during the peak selling season and the introduction of three new sonar products 
net sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal unit sales  which includes sonar units  combination sonar navigation units  and stand alone navigation units decreased and the average price per unit increased 
the decrease in unit sales resulted from a reduction in the sales of the company s navigation products coupled with a reduction in sales of sonar products 
reduced sales of the company s low and mid cost navigation products decrease in units was offset by increases in the unit sales of portable mapping  aviation and high end gimble units increase in units 
sales of the lowrance sonar products increased  offset by a decrease of in the sales of eagle sonar products 
the decreases in navigation sales resulted from a significant reduction in advertising expenditures  price increases in certain low cost models  and increased competition at the lower price points 
the decreases in eagle sonar sales resulted from generally weak market conditions during the spring selling season caused by adverse weather conditions in certain of the company s key markets in north america 
the company believes that the eagle products are generally purchased by the less serious fisherman which are more likely to be influenced by poor weather conditions 
additionally  reduced advertising and consumer outdoor show exposure along with price increases on certain models had a negative impact in eagle sonar sales 
net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal unit sales increased and the average price per unit decreased 
when comparing fiscal to  unit sales increased because of higher sales of the company s new low cost hand held gps products which are sold primarily to mass merchandisers  mail order catalog companies  retail sporting goods stores and wholesalers 
this increase was slightly offset by decreased sales of the company s sonar products 
the increase in gps sales resulted from the continuing expansion of this market  as well as the company s introduction of the eagle explorer and the lowrance globalnav models which began shipping in the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
also  the two new portable gps products with mapping capabilities  which began shipping in late  were available for the entire year in the decrease in the average price per unit resulted from increased sales of the explorer and globalnav units and an increased weighting in the sonar sales mix toward low priced sonar units 
this weighting was the result of limited availability of the company s six new mid and upper priced sonar products 
production delays resulted in several of these products shipping in limited quantities until late in the third quarter 
additionally  retailers are allocating more shelf space and are open to allocate more inventory dollars to gps at the expense of sonar products due to the rapid growth and market potential of gps 
gross profit the gross margin percentage increased from to from fiscal to the increase results from  lower manufacturing costs resulting from improved efficiencies and moving additional manufacturing functions from the company s tulsa facility to the company s mexico manufacturing facility  a shift in mix from lower margin low priced gps products to higher margin sonar products and higher priced gps mapping products  and price increases on certain sonar and gps models 
the gross margin percentage increased from to from fiscal to fiscal  due primarily to  the shift in mix of units sold away from the company s low and mid priced gps units which generally have a correspondingly low profit margin  a continuing shift of manufacturing operations to the company s mexico facility in fiscal  more efficient operations offset by lower total volumes in fiscal versus  and price increases on certain gps and sonar models 
the gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in due primarily to the shift in mix of units sold to the low priced gps units which generally have a correspondingly low profit margin  unplanned production of certain new products in the company s tulsa production facility versus in the new mexico facility  inefficiencies in certain production processes in the tulsa production facility  and high production labor cost and employee turnover in tulsa due to record low unemployment in that labor market 
additionally  the new sonar products  which began shipping in volume in the second and third quarters of  generally carry above average margins for the company  but were not available for much of the year 
operating expenses operating expenses  excluding severance and merger costs  as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in total costs decreased by  the decline in costs result from the continuation of an austerity program begun during fiscal and to a lesser extent lower variable costs resulting from lower sales 
during the company recognized  in severance costs related to tulsa workforce reductions 
these efforts were aimed at reducing costs through headcount elimination  as well as the transferring of certain production related jobs to lowrance s mexico manufacturing facility 
the total number of employees effected was additionally  the company incurred  in costs associated with its pending merger with orbital sciences corporation 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales decreased to versus in total costs decreased by  the major factors contributing to this decrease were a reduction of approximately million in advertising  selling and marketing expenditures and reduced research and development expenditures and general and administrative costs  offset by increases in other variable operating expenses  namely  product returns costs 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in total cost increased  the major factors contributing to this increase were  additional advertising and marketing expenses related to the company s push to acquire market share in the gps market and in introducing the new sonar products  other variable selling expenses  such as freight out and product returns cost  were up approximately  due to increased volumes  and research and development expenditures were up  due to the company s continuing efforts to develop new products 
expense reductions in general and administrative costs partially offset the effects of the above increases 
interest expense interest expense in decreased by  when compared to due to a lower average borrowings on the company s line of credit 
the average borrowings were lower due to improved profitability and increased inventory turnover 
interest expense in increased by million due to increased average borrowing levels related to the company s revolving credit line as well as new term loan borrowings of  a 
increase in the interest rate under the revolving credit line and an increase in interest charged by the company s suppliers due to the company s continuing inability to pay within stated terms 
interest expense in fiscal increased by  from due to increased borrowing levels primarily associated with the company s revolving credit line 
the increased borrowings under the revolving credit line resulted from higher working capital needs to support increased sales levels  the buildup of inventories  and for support of the move of certain manufacturing operations to the company s mexico manufacturing facility 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal  and was  and 
for fiscal  the company established a valuation allowance of  against the net deferred tax asset which resulted in a effective income tax expense 
for  lowrance recorded no net income tax provision 
the valuation allowance was reduced by the income tax provision of  to  resulting in no income tax provision for income loss net income loss as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital needs increase in the fall and winter months as the company manufactures and stockpiles its products for the peak sales months of january  february  march  and april 
also  the days outstanding in the company s accounts receivable increase in the off season due to favorable purchase terms offered to customers in order to stimulate sales during these slow periods 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations  an accounts receivable and inventory line of credit  lease financing as well as financing provided by the company s vendors 
the line of credit allows the company to borrow up to of its qualifying accounts receivable  of qualifying raw materials inventory  and of qualifying finished goods inventory 
borrowings for inventory  however  are limited to  a yearly lease line of credit is usually established to finance the acquisition of qualifying equipment and certain other assets 
traditionally  the company s near term liquidity is at its lowest during the period august through december due to limits on borrowings against inventories  cash outlays required to purchase tooling to manufacture new products  and extended payment terms offered to customers to stimulate sales during the seasonally slow period 
as previously described  it is during this period that the company begins to manufacture and build up inventory levels in anticipation of product demands for the peak sales months 
by the end of the second quarter  sales historically increase and the company s sources of liquidity begin to improve 
in fiscal  the company announced plans to expand its mexican manufacturing operation to meet increasing demand for its products  particularly gps models 
the company entered into a long term lease for a new manufacturing facility and was responsible for funding a large portion of the leasehold improvements necessary for the building to meet its specific production needs 
in addition to funding the leasehold improvements  it was necessary to build additional inventory levels during the last few months of fiscal to support expected sales during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company began relocating certain of its manufacturing operations to its new plant in mexico 
the start up of the new facility in mexico was substantially on schedule 
however  record low unemployment rates in tulsa resulted in excessive turnover of production workers and an inability to maintain sufficient trained staff to support the company s substantially increased production schedule intended to support record demand for its gps products 
this problem was magnified by management s focus on the start up of the new mexico facility and production delays of the company s six new sonar models 
these problems caused an excessive build up of raw material and work in process inventories that the company could not convert to finished goods during the fiscal year 
these factors resulted in inventories remaining well above historical levels throughout fiscal management implemented controls to better manage production scheduling and inventory levels 
during fiscal  first and second quarter sales exceeded levels for the same periods  however  sales unexpectedly declined during the third and fourth quarters 
the timing of the sales decline did not allow for reductions of shipments of raw materials from vendors based on the long lead times for certain component parts 
as a result  inventory levels during continued to be higher than historical levels 
inventory gradually declined throughout fiscal as the company consistently met its production and sales objectives 
cash flows provided by financing activities for fiscal were used to finance capital additions not financed by leases of million and to provide funds consumed in operating activities of million 
cash flows provided by financing activities were used to finance the net capital additions for fiscal and net cash used in operating activities 
the company s financing package was amended in august and december  which gave the company  in additional term loan financing million was repaid during fiscal 
the amendments also gave the company an additional million in borrowing capacity secured by certain inventories and receivables located outside of the united states 
the interest rate under the revolving line of credit was increased to prime plus from prime plus 
in november  the company s financing package was amended  giving the company additional term borrowings of million under an existing term loan and deferring principal payments until march  on an aggregate total term loan of million including the additional million borrowing 
this amended term loan requires monthly principal payments of  which began march  cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal of million were used to fund 
million of capital additions and to reduce outstanding debt 
management expects the sources discussed above to satisfy the company s current financing needs 
at july  there were approximately million of borrowings available under the company s revolving line of credit and all vendors were paid current 
this availability is expected to decline during the first quarter and the company expects some delays in making payments to vendors during the second quarter as it has historically done 
as sales increase toward the end of the second quarter  liquidity is expected to improve with payments to vendors returning to a current status during the third quarter 
working capital the company s working capital ratio was at july  and at july  this improvement was the result of utilizing cash flows from net income and inventory reductions to eliminate past due accounts payable and to reduce indebtedness 
long term debt and revolving credit agreement at july   the company s term and revolving credit loan agreement  which is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  provided for interest at a rate of over prime with maximum borrowings of up to  on the revolving line of credit 
in august and december  the company expanded the borrowings available under its term and revolving credit loan agreements 
this amended financing package included an additional million of term loans and up to million of additional borrowings under its revolving line of credit secured by certain inventories and receivables located outside the united states 
of the additional million of term loans  million was repaid during fiscal in november  the company s financing package was amended to allow for an additional term loan of million  as discussed above 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended july    and  respectively 
of the fiscal total  substantially all of this amount was related to production equipment and tooling 
effects of inflation a significant portion of the company s costs and expenses consist of materials  supplies  salaries  and wages that are affected by inflation 
due to the intense market pressures on prices  the company does not believe that it will be able to pass on inflationary increases in its selling prices 
accordingly  the company concentrates on changes in design  manufacturing process  material scheduling  and sourcing to help contain costs 
the company does not expect that the effects of inflation will have a significant impact on its profitability in the near future 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s raw material items are sourced overseas 
significant devaluation of the dollar relative to these currencies would not be able to be passed on in the form of price increases to consumers 
recently issued accounting principles the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  effective for the year ended july  this statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information effective for the year ended july  this statement establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
companies must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively and must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements and has not determined the timing of or method of the adoption of sfas no 
however  as of july   the company had no outstanding derivative instruments 
year compliance the company is taking appropriate steps to ensure that its computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to or 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company has evaluated its computer systems to identify those that could be effected by this issue 
all significant systems have been modified and tested 
management believes that all significant systems are year compliant 
the costs to modify the company s systems were not significant 
the company is also communicating with key suppliers and vendors to coordinate year compliance 
the highest risk area for the company related to the year issues is noncompliance by third parties 
at this time  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be year noncompliance by third parties that comprised a significant level of business conducted with the company 
depending upon the level of noncompliance  the company could be adversely impacted by such things as communication problems with third parties  including order processing  purchase order placement and or scheduling problems related to the manufacturing of the company s products 
the major risk areas associated with third party noncompliance have been identified 
based upon its assessment of third party assurances at this time  the company does not anticipate any material disruptions in its business activities as a result of third party year noncompliance  although it cannot be certain that such disruptions will not occur 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to cash flow and interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details on the company s long term debt 
merger with orbital sciences corporation on march   lowrance announced an agreement to merge with california based magellan corporation  a leading satellite access company  as part of a merger agreement between lowrance  magellan and magellan s parent company orbital sciences corporation nyse orb 
according to the merger agreement  lowrance shareholders will receive between  and  shares of orbital common stock  with the actual number of orbital shares issued to be determined by the market price of orbital stock prior to closing 
on august  the company restated and amended its agreement whereby each share of outstanding common stock of the company will be converted at the time of the merger into the right to receive for each share of the company common stock 
on october  lowrance shareholders approved the merger 
the transaction was anticipated to close in october  but certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement have not been satisfied  including receipt of the consent of orbital s lenders 
outlook the company anticipates continued profitability in fiscal  primarily as the result of continuing cost reduction efforts  continuing favorable economic and market conditions  and lower manufacturing cost related to continuing efficiencies from the company s mexico manufacturing facility 
management currently anticipates positive cash flows from operations in fiscal based on attaining current projections for net income and inventory levels 
the expectation for continued profitability based on the above factors constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company believes that these forecasts are based on reasonable assumptions  however  no assurances can be given that these goals will be achieved 
if the company experiences production delays due to raw materials shortages or unforeseen competitive pressures  this could have a material adverse affect on current projections 
also  because of the dynamic environment in which the company operates  one or more key factors which are discussed in part i  item business could have an adverse effect on results for the upcoming year
