net income loss year ended july  compared to the year ended july  net sales 
net sales for the year ended july  were million  a decrease of million or compared to million in the year ended july  this decrease was principally related to lower sales levels at intergel  and lower sales of synergy plus and vitamin specialties products

net sales for the year ended july  were million  an increase of million  or over million for the year ended july  this increase was principally attributable to the higher sales levels recorded at intergel  the company s soft gel encapsulation division  the inclusion of the company s vitamin specialties health food store and mail order operations  which were acquired in june of  the introduction of the company s liquafil soft gel encapsulated vitamin and supplement product line  and increased private brand sales levels at the company s west coast and canadian operations 
partially offsetting these factors was the reduction in sales of a line of products to a significant customer  reflecting the termination of the supply agreement relative to the customer s store brand  during the second quarter of fiscal  and the discontinuance of the revlon product line 
cost and expenses 
cost of sales for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million  or over million for the year ended july  cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
these increases are attributable to the shift in sales mix toward private brand products  resulting from increased promotional activities carried out by certain of the company s private brand customers  and the higher level of nutritional sales by the intergel division  which have lower profit margins than the company s core business segments 
the fourth quarter gross profit was detrimentally impacted by excess manufacturing labor caused by the unexpected volume decrease in the fourth quarter  as compared to the third quarter 
at july   the company took a physical count of all inventories and adjusted to these counts and valuations 
the above factors were partially offset by the inclusion of the vitamin specialties operations for the full year  and the increase in the gross profit margins at the portland facility attributable to new higher margin products which have been added to the line during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended july  were million  an increase of million or over million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily attributable to i achieving proper professional staff levels  mainly in accounting and finance  ii the inclusion of the vitamin specialties operations for the full year  iii increased consulting costs  primarily related to the implementation of new computer systems  and iv increased professional fees

liquidity and capital resources at july   the company had working capital of million compared to million at july   an increase of million 
during the year ended july  the entire long term debt was classified as a current liability as the company was in violation of certain covenants with its bank 
as indicated above  for the current year  the company restructured its financing arrangements and remedied all prior covenant violations 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled this was primarily the result of cash provided by reductions in inventory of million as management placed greater emphasis on reducing the inventory to more acceptable levels  collections of accounts receivable of million and reductions of prepaid expenses and other assets of million

for the year  the company s working capital needs and funds for capital expenditures were satisfied by cash flow generated from operations and bank borrowings 
the company believes that its existing cash balance  internally generated funds from operations and available financing will provide the liquidity required to satisfy the company s working capital needs and anticipated capital expenditures for the next year 
year yk compliance program over the past two years ivc industries  inc has replaced all information technologies hardware and software  upgraded laboratory equipment  and replaced facilities equipment 
the company completed comprehensive  company wide yk testing during which the systems performed successfully 
the company also contacted its vendors  suppliers  and service providers to seek assurance that they will be yk compliant 
nevertheless  satisfactorily addressing the yk issue is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
should the company s internal systems or the internal systems of one or more significant vendors or suppliers fail to achieve yk compliance  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the total costs associated with the company s compliance program are not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the company s new yk compliant management information systems would have been installed regardless of the yk issue 
the company s current estimates of the impact of the yk issue on its financial position do not include costs that may result from other companies failure to become yk compliant 
if  based on the responses to its inquiries  the company determines that any of its suppliers or vendors are not yk compliant  the company plans to arrange for alternative sources of supply 
the company believes that the products and services it purchases from its vendors and suppliers are available from numerous sources and that the loss of a particular supplier would not adversely affect its operations 
however  if the company is unable to locate suppliers that are yk compliant  there could be a material adverse affect on its operations 
due to the general uncertainty with respect to the yk issue  however  there can be no assurance that all yk issues will be foreseen and corrected on a timely basis  or that no material disruption of the company s business will occur 
further  the company s expectations are based on the assumption that there will be no general failure of external local  national or international systems including power  communications  postal or transportation systems necessary for the ordinary conduct of business 
the company will  however  continue to assess the risks presented by the yk problem and will develop contingency plans if and when such plans become necessary
