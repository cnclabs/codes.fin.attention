the effective tax rate decreased to in from in as a result of settlements with federal and state tax authorities in for the tax years to liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not considered to be capital intensive 
working capital requirements for the company have historically been provided by operating cash flow 
it is expected that such cash flows will continue to serve as the principal source of working capital for the company for the near future 
the company s current assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation 
the effects of inflation may result in increased employee compensation  occupancy costs  and promotional costs 
an increase in interest rates or a substantial decline in the value of fixed income or equity securities  which causes a significant decline in the net asset value of the funds managed by the company  would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s current capital structure  as of march   includes million shares of common stock outstanding and million of convertible subordinated debentures with a principal value of per debenture

at december  and  the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement 
the company believes that funds from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will provide adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future 
pepco  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is subject to the net capital requirements imposed on registered broker dealers by the securities exchange act of act 
at december   pepco had net capital as defined in the act of approximately million  which exceeded the regulatory minimum by million 
pepco operates pursuant to rule c paragraph a of the act and  accordingly  is required to maintain a ratio of aggregate indebtedness as defined in the act to net capital  which may not exceed to this ratio at december  was to management considers the liquidity of the company to be adequate to meet present and anticipated needs 
it is expected that the company will finance the acquisition of the zweig fund group through borrowings under a million bank credit facility  which is currently being negotiated 
borrowings under this facility would be unsecured and bear interest at a variable rate 
market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its investments and assets managed 
the company does not have any derivative investments and  as of the fourth quarter of  is no longer exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under a five year credit agreement with a consortium of banks  which has an interest rate that varies  at the company s option  one  two  three or six months after the borrowing date of the loan 
the company may select from the certificate of deposit  eurodollar  or the banks base lending rate 
the average interest rate on the credit agreement in and was approximately 
in addition  the company has subordinated debentures bearing interest at 
at december   the company estimated that the fair value of the subordinated debentures approximated market value 
the company also invests excess cash in marketable securities  which consist of mutual fund investments  of which the company is the advisor  and us government obligations 
the fair value of these investments approximated market value at december  the company s revenues are largely driven by the market value of its assets under management and is therefore exposed to fluctuations in market prices 
management fees earned on managed accounts and certain institutional accounts  for any given quarter  are based on the market value of the portfolio on the last day of the preceding quarter 
any significant increase or decline in the market value of assets managed on the last day of a quarter would result in an increase or decline in revenues for the following three months 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of a company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  other non business specific systems such as security alarms  elevators  telephones  etc 
are subject to malfunction due to their dependence upon computers or computer chips for proper operation 
based upon company assessments  it has been determined that the company will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will be mitigated 
it is anticipated that such modifications and conversions will be completed on a timely basis 
the failure of computer programs to recognize the year could have a negative impact on  but is not limited to  the handling of securities trades  the pricing of securities and the servicing of client accounts 
if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue would have a material impact on the operations of the company
