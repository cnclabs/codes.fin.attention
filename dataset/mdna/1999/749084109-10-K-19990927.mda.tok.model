forward looking information this discussion includes forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts  and can be identified by the use of some words  including may  believe  will  expect  project  estimate  anticipate  plan or continue 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current plans and expectations and projections about future events 
however  risks  uncertainties and assumptions that would cause or contribute to material differences in our future financial condition and results of operations include possible changes in medicare and medicaid that may further limit payments to our owned hospitals  the efforts of insurers  managed care companies  patients and other payors to reduce their payments to our owned hospitals  potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations and litigation  the possible enactment of federal  state or local health care reforms  changes in federal  state or local regulations affecting the health care industry  difficulties in reducing costs in response to lower payments from our payors  difficulties in finding attractive acquisitions and integrating acquired hospitals into our operations  market and geographic concentration of operations  the highly competitive nature of the health care business  potential loss of physicians or other key personnel  claims and legal actions relating to professional liability  the ability to address internal and external year issues  including disruptions from system conversions  our substantial indebtedness and difficulty raising capital in the future  fluctuations in the market value of our common stock  changes in accounting pronouncements  and changes in general economic conditions 
overview we are a leading provider of health care services through our owned acute care hospitals and regional health care systems located throughout the united states 
we are also the largest provider of management services to acute care hospitals in the united states  primarily through our subsidiary  quorum health resources  llc 
in fiscal  our owned hospitals accounted for of our net operating revenue compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  the dothan  alabama and ft 
wayne  indiana areas accounted for approximately of owned hospital revenue and of owned hospital ebitda 
ebitda means our earnings before interest  minority interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  write down of assets and investigation and litigation related costs 
we received from the medicare and medicaid programs approximately  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended june   and  respectively 
in each of fiscal and fiscal  our net income grew over the prior fiscal year  before write down of assets and extraordinary charges 
for fiscal  our net income before write down of assets and investigation and litigation related costs was lower than we initially projected and lower than fiscal we believe this was principally due to the following issues we received lower payments from the government under the medicare program as a result of the balanced budget act of bba 
we experienced increased discounts to insurance and managed care companies and increased charity care 
we were unable to reduce our costs proportionately with the decline in net operating revenue 
our estimated current year and final settlements from the government under medicare and medicaid programs and from insurance and managed care companies were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal the hospitals we acquired during fiscal reduced net income 
impact of acquisitions  joint ventures and sales in fiscal  we acquired four hospitals and affiliated health care entities 
we also entered into a joint venture in vicksburg  mississippi 
we manage and have a controlling interest in the joint venture 
some of these entities did not perform as well as we initially expected 
this was due to some of the same factors we experienced in our other owned hospitals 
also  we had difficulties integrating some of the acquired hospitals into our operations 
in fiscal  we sold park medical center in columbus  ohio 
in fiscal  we acquired two hospitals and affiliated health care entities 
we also contributed three hospitals and cash for equity interests in joint ventures in las vegas  nevada and macon  georgia 
we sold our interest in a nebraska hospital 
because of the financial impact of acquisitions  joint ventures and sales  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the periods presented 
due to the current number of owned hospitals  each additional hospital we acquire can affect our overall operating margins or results of operations 
litigation we are currently  and from time to time expect to be  subject to claims  suits and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business 
we may not know about investigations or qui tam actions filed against us by private parties on behalf of the federal or state governments 
plaintiffs in these matters may request punitive or other damages that may not be covered by insurance 
except for the litigation described below  we are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services requested information from us in connection with an investigation involving our procedures for preparing medicare cost reports 
in january  the united states department of justice issued a civil investigative demand which also requested information from us in connection with the same investigation 
as a part of the government s investigation  several former and current employees were interviewed 
we cooperated fully with the investigation 
we received no communication from the government on this matter from approximately june through august in august  the government informed us that the investigation was prompted by a lawsuit filed under the false claims act 
the suit was filed in january by a former employee of a hospital we managed 
these lawsuits  commonly known as qui tam actions  are filed under seal 
that means that the claims are kept secret until the government decides whether to join the case 
the person who files the lawsuit is called a relator 
at a meeting in september  we learned from the government that it would likely join in the case 
the government joined the case against us in october the former employee s lawsuit named us  our subsidiary quorum health resources  columbia hca healthcare corporation and all hospitals that we or columbia hca owned  operated or managed from through  as defendants 
the unsealed complaint  prepared by the relator  alleged that we knowingly prepared and caused to be filed cost reports which claimed payments from medicare and other government payment programs greater than the amounts due 
in january  we filed motions with the court asking to be separated from the case against co defendant columbia hca 
the government did not oppose the motion to separate the cases against us and columbia hca 
on february   the government filed an amended complaint 
on that date  the government also filed a notice of non intervention advising the court that it would not proceed on some of the relator s allegations  and that it would not sue individual managed hospital clients 
the government s complaint did not name as defendants any hospital we managed 
it does name us  quorum health resources and each subsidiary which now owns or has ever owned a hospital 
the february  complaint alleges that we  on behalf of hospitals we managed between and and hospitals we owned from to the present  violated the false claims act by filing false medicare cost reports 
the government asserts that the false claims in the cost reports are reflected in reserve analyses we created 
the complaint also alleges that these cost report filings were prepared as the result of our policy 
on april   we filed several motions to dismiss the government s complaint in whole or in part as well as a motion to dismiss the relator from the case 
the government and the relator replied to our motions in june  and we filed a reply in july  the court has not ruled on our motions 
this qui tam action seeks three times the amount of damages caused to the united states by our submission of any medicare or other government health care program alleged false claims to the government  civil penalties of not less than  nor more than  for each false claim  and attorneys fees and costs 
in may  we were informed that we were a defendant in another qui tam action involving home health services provided by two of our owned hospitals and alleging that we had violated medicare laws 
this action was filed under seal in june by a former employee  whom we fired in april the united states attorney s office gave us the opportunity to review the results of the government s investigations and discuss the allegations made in the action prior to the government making a decision to intervene as a plaintiff 
the lawsuit remains under seal for all other purposes 
we have cooperated fully with the united states attorney s office and provided additional information and made employees available for interviews 
we have started preliminary settlement discussions with the government 
as a part of our ongoing discussions  we have learned from the same us attorney that there are two additional unrelated qui tam complaints against us alleging medicare violations at one owned and two managed hospitals 
both matters remain under seal 
we have not seen the complaint in either matter 
the government has told us that it intends to investigate these allegations 
we intend to cooperate with the government s investigation 
we were named as a defendant in a class action brought by some of our stockholders 
in the class action  the plaintiffs allege that we violated the securities exchange act of by materially overstating our financial results 
we were also named as a defendant  along with some of our current directors and two of our former directors  in a stockholders derivative action 
in the stockholders derivative action  the plaintiffs allege that our directors knew in that we were filing false medicare cost reports and that the directors mandated that this practice continue 
we and the other defendants intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits 
it is too early to predict the effect or outcome of any of the ongoing investigations or the qui tam  class or stockholders derivative actions  or whether any additional investigations or litigation will be commenced 
if we are found to have violated federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs  then we may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal penalties 
we also may be excluded from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions are substantial 
we could be subject to substantial costs resulting from an adverse outcome of any of these actions 
in an effort to promptly resolve one or more of these matters  we may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material 
any one or more of these actions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
see part  item  legal proceedings and note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table reflects the percentage of net operating revenue represented by various categories in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal years  and results of operations for fiscal include a full year of operations for sixteen hospitals and the las vegas and macon joint ventures and partial periods for one hospital sold  four hospitals acquired by us and one contributed by columbia hca to a joint venture that we control 
results of operations for fiscal include a full year of operations for fifteen hospitals and partial periods for one hospital sold  the las vegas and macon joint ventures  three hospitals contributed to joint ventures and two hospitals acquired during the year

ebitda represents earnings before interest  minority interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  write down of assets and investigation and litigation related costs 
ebitdar represents ebitda before leases and rentals 
ebitda and ebitdar are commonly used as analytical indicators  and also serve as a measure of indebtedness capacity and debt service ability 
we have included ebitda and ebitdar data because they are typically used by investors to measure a company s ability to service debt 
ebitda and ebitdar should not be considered measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  and the items excluded from ebitda and ebitdar are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda and ebitdar should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
because ebitda and ebitdar are not measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and ebitdar as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

we attribute this increase to the acquisition of six hospitals during fiscal and fiscal  the hospital contributed by columbia hca in fiscal to a joint venture that we control and a increase in revenue from our hospital management services 
the increase in net operating revenue was partially offset by decreases due to the sales of our columbus hospital in fiscal and nebraska hospital in fiscal  the contribution in fiscal of three hospitals to joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest and a decrease in net operating revenue produced by same store hospitals 
we attribute this decrease principally to lower payments from the government under the medicare program as a result of bba  increased discounts to insurance and managed care companies and increased charity care  and decreased estimated current year and final settlements from the government under medicare and medicaid programs and from insurance and managed care companies estimated third party payor settlements are discussed under the caption general

write down of assets and investigation and litigation related costs 
during fiscal  we recorded write downs of assets and investigation and litigation related costs of approximately million 
approximately million consisted of the write down of intangible assets related to physician practices based on our review of expected future cash flows 
we reviewed physician practices as a result of recent changes in the physician practice management industry and because we had enough historical financial information to give us additional data for changing estimated future cash flows

these amounts were due to our investment in our las vegas and macon joint ventures 
since we formed these joint ventures in fiscal  there is no comparable amount for fiscal leases and rentals

on november of each year  we can request an incremental one year extension  which is subject to approval of all of the lenders 
the credit facility bears interest at our option at generally the lender s base rate  swing line rate or a fluctuating rate ranging from 
to percentage points above libor 
also  we pay a facility fee ranging from 
to 
percentage points on the commitment 
the interest rate margins and facility fee rates are based on our leverage ratio 
substantially all stock of our subsidiaries has been pledged under the terms of the credit facility 
we may prepay the amount outstanding at any time 
at july   we had million available under our credit facility 
we also have a million end loaded lease financing agreement to provide a financing option for acquisition and or construction 
this agreement provides for interest rate margins and facility fee rates that are substantially similar to those under our credit facility 
under this agreement  we have guaranteed all lease payments  including contingent lease payments  of up to of the amount utilized under this agreement 
at july   million was available under this agreement 
we have million of senior subordinated notes  which mature on november  we have the option to redeem these notes at of the principal amount on or after november   at of the principal amount on or after november   or at par value on or after november  upon a change of control  we must make an offer to purchase these notes at of the principal amount 
these notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt 
on august   we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due to welsh  carson  anderson stowe  viii  lp and certain wcas viii affiliates 
the debentures bear interest at per annum 
interest is payable quarterly

in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  additional shares of common stock 
we may use the shares purchased to offset the effects of our stock based employee benefit plans 
as of july   we had repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we repurchased all of these shares in open market transactions in october and november as of july   there were  options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of 
in march  our board of directors approved a plan to allow employees to exchange underwater stock options 
these stock options had exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock 
based on the exchange  we canceled  options at exercise prices ranging from to and issued  options at an exercise price of 
the effect was to reduce the number of options held to offset the benefit of a lower exercise price 
the estimated economic value of the grants was generally unchanged as a result of the exchange 
under the proposed interpretation of apb opinion no 
 repriced options would receive variable award accounting 
should we be required to apply variable award accounting to the repriced options  such options will vest and terminate thirty days after we give notice to our employees 
during this thirty day period  variable award accounting could cause an increase in our compensation expense 
during fiscal  our board of directors approved a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on september   to shareholders of record on september  in addition  our stockholders approved an amendment to our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under our qualified employee stock purchase plan to  and the stock option plan 
under the stock option plan  we can grant non qualified and incentive stock options 
stock options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant and are exercisable over a period not to exceed ten years 
the number of shares reserved for issuance under outstanding options and future grants was  at july  we adopted a stockholder rights plan in fiscal and declared a dividend of one right for each share of common stock 
the plan was amended in august each right entitles stockholders to acquire one third of a share of common stock at an exercise price of  subject to adjustment 
the rights become exercisable only if welsh  carson  anderson stowe viii  lp  wcas management corporation and certain parties which purchase the convertible debentures from these entities acquire beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or start an offer which would result in those entities owning or more of our common stock or any other person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or starts an offer which would result in that person or group owning or more of our common stock 
at that time  each right owned by unaffiliated others entitles its holder to purchase common stock or any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and cash  as determined by our board of directors worth two times the exercise price of the right 
if we are involved in a business combination transaction with another person or if we sell or more of our assets or earning power to another person  each right entitles its holder to purchase shares of our common stock or the acquiring company s common stock worth two times the exercise price of the right 
we may redeem the rights for 
each at any time until the tenth day following public announcement that an ownership position as described above has been acquired 
the rights expire on april  capital expenditures capital expenditures excluding acquisitions in fiscal totaled million 
of this total  we used approximately million to complete the construction of the replacement hospital in florence  south carolina  which had a total cost of approximately million 
we expect to make routine capital expenditures excluding acquisitions for fiscal of approximately to million 
capital expenditures excluding acquisitions for fiscal totaled million 
these capital expenditures consisted primarily of the construction of a replacement hospital and two medical office buildings in florence  south carolina of approximately million and routine capital expenditures in the amount of million 
during fiscal  we used million in cash for acquisitions 
we acquired four hospitals and affiliated healthcare entities and entered into operating lease agreements to lease land and buildings used by three of these hospitals 
the estimated fair market value of the leased land and buildings was million 
in addition  through one of our subsidiaries  we contributed a hospital and related business to acquire a controlling interest in a joint venture in vicksburg  mississippi 
we manage the joint venture 
during fiscal  we used million in cash for acquisitions 
we acquired two hospitals and affiliated health care entities and entered into operating lease agreements to lease land and buildings used by one hospital 
the estimated fair market value of the leased land and buildings was million 
also  we contributed three hospitals and paid approximately million in exchange for minority interests in joint ventures in las vegas  nevada and macon  georgia 
these joint ventures own and operate seven hospitals and are managed by our joint venture partners 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal  with higher patient volumes and net operating revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal year than in the remainder of the year 
this seasonality happens because more people get sick during the winter  which in turn increases the number of patients in our owned hospitals 
the health care industry is labor intensive 
this means that our owned hospitals need many employees  who we pay salaries and other benefits 
these salaries and benefits increase during periods of inflation and shortages of qualified potential employees 
in addition  our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
until fiscal  we generally were able to offset these cost increases by expanding  and increasing charges for  our hospital services and procedures 
as discussed earlier  in fiscal  we were not able to reduce costs proportionately with reductions in payments from our payors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to offset or control future cost increases 
market risks associated with financial instruments our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally maintain of our debt at a fixed rate  either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
interest rate swap agreements are contracts which allow us to periodically exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time we execute the swap agreement 
our policy is to not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
some of our swap agreements allow the counter party a one time option at the end of the initial term to cancel the agreement or a one time option at the end of the initial term to extend the swaps for an incremental period of up to five years 
if our counter parties do not comply with their obligations under our financial instruments  we may suffer losses 
our counter parties are creditworthy financial institutions and we anticipate that they will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
for the years ended june   and  we received a weighted average rate of  and and paid a weighted average rate of  and  respectively 
the following table presents information about our market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt and interest rate swaps as of june  for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swap agreements  the table presents notional amounts by expected maturity date assuming the options to extend or cancel are not exercised and weighted average interest rates based on rates in effect at june  the fair values of long term debt and interest rate swaps were determined based on quoted market prices at june  for the same or similar issues 
maturity date  fiscal year ending june dollars in millions june  fair value there of after total liabilities long term debt fixed rate long term debt average interest rates variable rate long term debt average interest rates interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable notional amounts average pay rate average receive rate year issues the year problem refers to the inability of computers and related software to correctly interpret and process year dated transactions 
this occurs because some computer programs and embedded chip systems use two digits instead of four to define the applicable year 
computer systems that are not year compliant may not process data accurately for transactions dated after the year any of our computer programs  embedded chip systems  building infrastructure components or medical devices that have date sensitive software may recognize as the year rather than the year our computer programs  embedded chip systems or equipment  and medical devices could fail if we do not correct this problem in time 
this could in turn disrupt our business operations or affect patient diagnosis and treatment 
our year strategy is led by our vice president of corporate services 
as part of our strategy  in july  we retained an external firm to provide consulting services and to assist us in implementing our year strategy 
we have a year steering committee to assist us in implementing our year strategy 
our year strategy addresses our owned and managed hospitals and our corporate offices 
owned hospitals and corporate office our owned hospitals and the corporate office year strategy includes phases for education  inventory and assessment  validation including testing and conversion remediation replacement 
we are also developing contingency plans to address potential disruption of operations arising from the year problem

we have completed the education phase of our year strategy 
education will continue to be provided throughout the year implementation process

we have substantially completed the inventory and assessment phase of our year strategy 
testing and remediation 
tier approach owned hospitals 
we have adopted a tier approach for year project completion 
tier addresses applications and equipment that have a direct impact on patient safety and health or are essential to our daily operations 
tier represents applications and equipment that are critical to continued business operations  but not required to provide day to day service to the patients and for which a viable alternative exists 
tier indicates applications and equipment not essential to our daily operations 
we have given first priority in our testing and remediation efforts to date to tier applications and equipment as described below 
however  we are also currently validating and remediating tier devices  components and systems 
we currently expect to substantially complete validation and remediation of tier devices  components and systems by the end of in addition to our own testing  we are also using an outside vendor to gather and monitor manufacturer year compliance information of biomedical devices  building infrastructure components and information systems 
in general  we are relying on vendor verification of year compliance for tier devices  components and systems  rather than testing these items 
financial application software and hardware owned hospitals 
third parties supply and support the financial application software used in our owned hospitals in such areas as patient accounting and financial reporting 
we use very little in house developed software 
sixteen hospitals have been advised by the manufacturers of our financial software systems that such software is substantially year compliant 
we have scheduled two owned hospitals to convert in october revised from december to a financial software system which is represented by the manufacturer to be year compliant 
we have scheduled upgrades of the financial systems for one hospital to be completed in october and the two remaining hospitals which share one system by early december the vendors of our owned hospitals financial application software have tested the standard versions of their software 
we have discussed with the vendors their testing procedures and test results  and considered their written representation of year compliance 
we believe that the vendors have sufficiently tested the standard software 
some of our hospitals have customized the standard software 
in addition  all of our hospitals have interfaces which permit information to be transferred among different software programs and computer equipment 
we have inventoried and are now evaluating the level of risk in the customized versions of the standard financial application software and the interfaces to determine whether any further testing or remediation is required 
clinical and other software and hardware owned hospitals 
we also use clinical software and hardware such as laboratory and pharmacy systems and related computer equipment in our owned hospitals 
we are now testing and remediating the computer equipment which we have designated as tier systems 
for tier clinical software and hardware which cannot be tested without taking it out of service  we currently plan to follow a process similar to that outlined above for verifying year readiness for financial application software 
we currently expect to complete testing and validation of all tier clinical systems in september we believe that approximately of the tier systems requiring year validation are now year compliant 
we currently expect to complete remediation of the remaining by the end of biomedical equipment and building infrastructure owned hospitals 
we have substantially completed testing and validation of all tier biomedical equipment 
we have not tested devices where the manufacturer has advised us against testing such equipment and represented year compliance in writing 
we believe that approximately of the tier devices requiring year validation are now year compliant 
we currently expect to complete remediation for the remaining by the end of revised from september 
our policy is that we will not use any tier biomedical device without reasonable assurance that it will perform properly in light of the year problem 
such assurance may take the form of testing  vendor assurances of year compliance or  where feasible  developing a work around procedure for the device in case of a possible malfunction 
we expect to complete testing and validation of year related tier building infrastructure components of our owned hospitals in september remediation has been ongoing during the testing phase 
we believe that approximately of the tier components requiring year validation are now year compliant 
we currently expect approximately of the tier components requiring year validation to be year compliant by october the remaining is scheduled to be completed by early december revised from september 
corporate office 
we believe that our corporate office network is substantially year compliant 
we have been advised by the manufacturer that the financial software applications used by our corporate office are substantially year compliant 
we have substantially completed the education  inventory  remediation and testing phases with respect to other corporate office and satellite office computer equipment  including desktop computers and building infrastructure 
managed hospitals in december  we notified the owners of our managed hospitals that we did not have the necessary expertise to assist hospitals with their year problem 
we advised the owners of our managed hospitals that they should engage outside consultants to assist them in their year compliance efforts 
we also recommended that each managed hospital create a year committee charged with the design  implementation and day to day oversight of the managed hospital s year compliance efforts  and that the governing body of each managed hospital receive regular monthly reports from its year committee 
we have distributed educational materials about the year problem to the owners of our managed hospitals 
we monitor the progress of the response of our managed hospitals to the year problem by asking them to report to us the status of their year strategy 
we do not independently verify their reports 
we have also identified third party resources which our managed hospitals may choose to use to assist them in addressing their year problem 
we believe we are not responsible for ensuring the year compliance of our managed hospitals 
we are not able to verify the status of remediation efforts at our managed hospitals 
therefore  we are not able to evaluate the most reasonably likely year worst case scenario for our managed hospitals 
because we provide only management services  we do not pay the expenses of our managed hospitals and  therefore  we do not expect to incur any significant year remediation costs for our managed hospitals 
we cannot assure you that our managed hospitals will not seek to hold us responsible for losses they incur arising out of their year problem 
nor can we assure you that we will not ultimately be found liable for the losses which  if they occur  may be material 
reliance on third parties we rely heavily on third parties in operating our business 
in addition to our reliance on software  hardware and other equipment vendors to verify the year compliance of their products  we also depend on fiscal intermediaries which process claims and make payments for the medicare and medicaid programs  insurance companies  managed care entities and other third party payors  third party processors which submit our medicare claims for payment  utilities which provide electricity  water  gas and telephone services and vendors of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used in patient care 
we are contacting the most critical third parties to determine whether they believe they are year compliant and if not  the extent to which our operations may be adversely affected 
we will modify contingency plans as necessary 
we cannot assure you that the systems or products of third parties on which we rely will be converted on a timely basis or that their failure to become year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 
in its june  quarterly progress report  the health care financing administration stated that all of its internal mission critical systems and mission critical external claims processing systems were year compliant 
we are seeking assurances from fiscal intermediaries  third party claims processors  and other payors that their systems are year compliant 
we expect this process to continue through the remainder of costs to address year issue we currently estimate that the total cost to implement our year strategy will be about million 
this does not include payroll costs for certain internal employees because we do not separately track these costs 
it also does not include the costs of implementing contingency plans  if required 
we incurred approximately million in operating costs and million in capital costs during the first six months of calendar prior to this time  we were not able to reasonably estimate our year costs incurred 
we believe that to of the remaining costs will be capital costs 
we set aside a portion of our fiscal capital budget as year costs and expect that substantially all of our year capital costs can be accommodated within our budget 
all cost estimates are preliminary and are expected to be revised as the project progresses 
there can be no guarantees that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
worst case scenarios we believe that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would involve malfunctions in clinical computer software and hardware at our owned hospitals  malfunctions in biomedical equipment at our owned hospitals  temporary disruptions in the delivery of medical supplies and utility services to our owned hospitals and temporary disruptions in payments to our owned hospitals 
any of these worst case scenarios could materially disrupt our business and operations 
in addition  if any of these things occur  we will have increased costs  as the affected hospital will have to refer patients and procedures to other health care providers  contact alternative suppliers and increase staffing to assure adequate patient care 
we could also lose revenue for procedures which our hospitals are unable to perform 
for example  our hospitals plan to suspend a service if year compliant equipment required for that service is unavailable 
our cash flow will be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in payments 
we are basing the above assessment on information currently available to us 
our actual results may differ materially 
contingency plans we developed contingency plans in all of our owned hospitals that we believe will reduce disruption in service that may be caused by the year problem 
as part of our contingency plan  each of our owned hospitals has a disaster plan  which we review regularly 
these disaster plans are designed to enable the hospital to continue to function during natural disasters and other crises 
the plans contemplate moving patients to other facilities if the hospital is not able to continue to care for them 
in some cases  we may not be able to develop contingency plans which allow the hospital to continue to operate 
for example  the affected hospital may not be able to secure supplies of fuel to operate its backup generators if electrical supplies fail for an extended period 
we are also developing a contingency plan for our corporate offices 
risks of year issues we can provide no assurances that applications and equipment we believe to be year compliant will not experience difficulties  that year issues will not arise that we did not contemplate or erroneously assigned a low level of risk  or that we will not experience difficulties obtaining resources needed to make modifications to or replace affected systems and equipment 
failure by us or third parties on which we rely to resolve year issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to provide health care services 
consequently  we can give no assurances that issues related to year will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our year readiness program is an ongoing process and the risk assessments and estimates of costs and completion dates for various phases of the program are subject to change 
the projected cost of the year program and the dates on which we believe the phases of the program will be completed are based on our best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events 
factors that could cause such changes include availability of qualified personnel and consultants  the actions of third parties and changes in governmental regulations 
we can give no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
general under bba  there were no increases in the inpatient operating payment rates to acute care hospitals for services from october  through september  inpatient operating payment rates increased for october  through september  and are expected to increase effective october  through september  these increases are less than inflation and subsequent increases are also expected to be less than inflation 
also  the threshold to qualify for additional payments for treating costly inpatient cases outliers increased  resulting in decreased payments to hospitals effective october  bba reduced inpatient capital payments in the aggregate by approximately effective october  payments for medicare outpatient services  home health services and skilled nursing facility services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain adjustments and limits 
bba requires that the payment for those services be converted to prospective payment systems pps 
pps for skilled nursing facilities began for cost reporting periods beginning on and after july  the health care financing administration s current plan is to implement pps for outpatients by july  and for home health on october  we believe that outpatient pps may be delayed until january we experienced reductions in payments for outpatient services beginning in fiscal we also experienced reductions in home health volumes and payment levels because of changes in home health reimbursement prior to implementation of pps  as well as reductions in payments under pps for skilled nursing facilities 
our home health visits have begun to stabilize 
in response to bba  we have consolidated certain home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities  reduced costs at our home health agencies and ceased admitting patients to skilled nursing facilities at two hospitals 
the federal government now estimates that bba will reduce health care spending by approximately double the government s original estimate 
bba has reduced our ability to maintain our historical rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
bba and further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit health care spending could have a material adverse impact upon the health care industry and our hospitals 
we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental health care programs 
we are continuing to experience an increase in managed care 
managed care includes indemnity insurance and employer plans which pay less than full charges  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care 
an increasing number of payors are actively negotiating amounts paid to hospitals  which are lower than the hospitals standard rates 
additionally  some managed care payors pay less than the negotiated rate which  if undetected  results in lower net revenues 
to assist the owned hospital management teams in evaluating and negotiating contracts and obtaining better pricing  we employ managed care experts 
in several markets  we have canceled contracts with ppos who allow discounts we believe are not justified 
we are reviewing other markets for similar activity 
additionally  we plan to install managed care information systems in our owned hospitals to improve the information available to management and to help ensure that we are paid at the contracted amounts 
the trend toward managed care has and may continue to adversely affect our ability to grow net operating revenue and improve operating margins 
our acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient volumes continue to be negatively affected by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
over the long term  we expect the industry trend from inpatient to outpatient services to continue due to the increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
we also expect increased competition and admission constraints to continue 
the ability to successfully respond to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental health care programs  will play a significant role in determining our ability to grow net operating revenue and improve operating margins 
outpatient revenue of our owned hospitals was approximately  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended june   and  respectively 
until fiscal  our historical financial trend has been favorably impacted by our ability to successfully acquire acute care hospitals 
during fiscal  the financial performance of our recent acquisitions adversely affected our operating margin and results of operations 
we believe that trends in the health care industry described above may create possible future acquisition opportunities 
we face competition in acquiring hospitals from a number of well capitalized organizations 
a recent national study indicates that acute care hospital margins peaked in and are expected to decline for the next several years 
the pricing expected by hospital sellers may not yet reflect lower margins 
additionally  some hospitals are sold through an auction process  which may result in competitors paying higher prices for those properties than we believe is reasonable 
in light of changes in payments from medicare and managed care payors  increased pricing pressures for acquired hospitals and the substantial number of transactions completed in fiscal  we intend to be selective in pursuing acquisitions 
the year problem may reduce the number of suitable hospital acquisition candidates 
many states have implemented review processes by the attorneys general of not for profit hospital acquisitions  resulting in delays to close an acquisition 
there can be no assurances that we can continue to grow through hospital acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired hospitals into our system 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we estimate settlements with third party payors 
these estimates are based on assumptions and affect the amounts we report in our financial statements 
for example  we report net patient service revenue at net amounts we expect to receive from our hospital patients  third party payors  and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under agreements with third party payors 
we make estimates of settlements under agreements with third party payors in the period we provide the related services 
we then adjust the settlements as final settlements are determined or additional information is obtained from the third party payor 
our quarterly or annual operating results fluctuate based on the timing and amount of changes in estimates 
our adjustments to estimated final settlements increased revenue by million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the irs is examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through the irs has proposed to adjust our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through the most significant adjustments relate to how we compute bad debt expense and how we value property  plant and equipment of hospitals we acquire and their related depreciable lives 
we intend to protest substantially all of the proposed adjustments through the appeals process of the irs 
in our opinion  the ultimate outcome of the irs examinations will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through changes to our income statement 
for interest rate swap agreements that qualify as hedges  we will offset changes in fair value against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through changes to our earnings 
we will adopt this new fasb standard on july  we are presently evaluating the new standard to determine its effect on our earnings and financial position 
on march   the fasb released a proposed interpretation relating to accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
this proposed interpretation requires variable award accounting for repriced stock options 
the fasb expects the proposed interpretation to be effective in the fourth calendar quarter of however  it would apply to transactions that occur after december  no adjustments would be made to financial statements for periods prior to the effective date and no expense would be recognized for any additional compensation costs attributable to periods before the effective date see capital resources
