other year issues background 
the following is a discussion of the year date issue year issue as it affects the company 
many computer programs and embedded chips in other forms of technology use only the last two digits to identify a year in a date field 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches 
assessment 
the company currently believes its potential exposure to problems arising from the year issue lies primarily in three areas the company s internal operating systems which may not be year compliant  potential year non compliance of systems of third parties with whom the company has a business relationship  and  non compliance of information technology products developed by third parties on which the company performs services 
the company has completed an assessment of its principal internal systems 
however  it continues to assess its year exposure with respect to third parties 
while the cost of these assessment efforts is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations  there is no assurance that this will be the case 
internal operating systems 
the company is dependent upon management information systems for all phases of its operations and financial reporting 
the company began addressing the affect of the year issue in the company has acquired year compliant versions for all of its principal systems and modules 
the company is in the process of testing the year compliant versions of all hardware and software components and applications pertaining to its internal operating systems upon which the company relies 
there may be some non critical applications that are not year compliant 
third party relationships 
the failure of a supplier to deliver timely year compliant products to our customers could jeopardize the company s ability to meet obligations to customers 
in addition  we may be liable for year non compliance of information technology products on which the company performs services 
the company is conducting a program to identify and resolve year exposure from third parties 
any failure of third parties with whom the company has a business relationship to resolve year problems with their products in a timely manner could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is also dependent on third party service providers  such as telephone companies  banks and insurance carriers 
the company is not aware of any significant year exposure  however  we have not inquired or implemented any program to assure year compliance by them 
state of readiness 
the company estimates that it will complete its testing of its principal information technology systems by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal upon completion of the testing of the year versions of its principal systems  the company will convert all operations to the year compliant system  which is estimated to be operational during the third quarter of fiscal costs to address year issues 
other than time spent by the company s own personnel  the company has not incurred any significant costs in identifying year issues 
the company does not anticipate any significant costs to make its internal systems year compliant because no remediation is expected to be required 
accordingly  the company has not deferred other information technology projects due to year efforts 
page risks of year issues 
the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would include a combination of some or all of the following internal it modules or systems may fail to operate or may give erroneous information 
such failure could result in shipping delays  reduced utilization of technical personnel  inability to timely generate financial reports and statements  inability of the company to communicate with its branch offices  and computer network downtime resulting in numerous inefficiencies and higher payroll expenses 
non it components in hvac  lighting  telephone  security and similar systems might fail and cause the entire system to fail 
communications with customers that depend upon it or non it technology  such as edi including automatic ordering by and for customers  and obtaining current pricing from vendors  may fail or give erroneous information 
these types of problems could result in such difficulties as the inability to receive or process customer orders  shipping delays  or sale of products at erroneous prices 
the unavailability of product as a result of year problems experienced by one or more key vendors of the company  or as a result of changes in inventory levels of aggregators  vars and similar providers in response to an anticipated year problem or the inability of the company to develop alternative sources for products 
products sold to some of the company s customers could fail to perform some or all of their intended functions 
in such a situation  the company s maximum obligation would be to repair or replace the defective products to the extent the company is required to do so under manufacturer warranty 
contingency plans 
the company believes its plans for addressing the year issue are adequate 
the company does not believe it will incur a material financial impact from system failures  or from the costs associated with assessing the risks of failure  arising from year problems 
consequently  the company does not intend to create a detailed contingency plan 
in the event the company does not adequately identify and resolve year issues  the absence of a detailed contingency plan may adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations
