item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for each of the past three years in the period ended december  the company acquired the stock of teletrac on may   the stock of pai on april   and substantially all of the assets of lmbc on october  these acquisitions  which are all part of the psg  have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of the continuing operations of teletrac  pai and lmbc have been included in the company s consolidated statement of operations since their respective dates of acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on september  the company sold its sensor systems business segment 
this divestiture  which effective january  with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 was treated as a separate segment and has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the results of the operations of this business segment through the date of the sale and the loss from the disposal are reflected in discontinued operations

net sales decreased by  or million  from million in to million in the psg s sales increased by  or million  from million in to million in the psg s sales increased by approximately million as a result of having a full year of operations from teletrac  which was acquired in may  and as a result of internal growth in the defense and digital imaging markets 
these increases were offset by a decline in revenues from the electronics capital equipment and space markets 
the decline in the electronics capital equipment market was the result of the continuing difficulties in the asian economy and specific weakness in the data storage and semiconductor segments of that market 
the decline in the space market was primarily due to the winding down of two major satellite programs 
the icg s sales decreased by  or million  from million in to million in sales of electronic interconnect products grew  or million over the prior year as a result of the introduction and continuing acceptance of new product offerings 
sales of precision ball bearings were down  or million over the prior year primarily due to the weakness in the electronics capital equipment market and the manufacturing segment in general

the company s gross profit decreased by  or million  from million in to million in gross profit margin decreased from of net sales in to in the gross margin for the psg increased from of net sales in to in and  for the icg  decreased from of net sales in to in gross profit margins in both the psg and icg were impacted by lower sales volume related inefficiencies  increased spending on engineering and manufacturing overhead  and higher depreciation expense 
in the psg  these inefficiencies were offset by a favorable mix of higher margin sales revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses of million in were substantially the same as as the increase in expense due to the inclusion of teletrac for the full year was offset by lower incentive expense in as a percentage of net sales  sg a was in  compared with in research and development expenses 
r d expenses increased by  or million  from million in to million in the increase in r d expenses was primarily due to higher spending on new product development for the electronics capital equipment market and the inclusion of teletrac for the full year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by  or million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowings during resulting from the company s use of the net proceeds approximately million from its stock offering in late october of to repay indebtedness under the company s senior credit facility 
taxes 
the company s effective tax rate  decreased from in to in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in the second quarter of the company offset its normal continuing operations tax provision by the reversal of a portion of its tax valuation allowance

the company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets in future periods 
discontinued operations 
in september  the company sold its sensor systems business segment and recorded a loss on the disposal of million  net of a tax benefit of million 
results of operations from the discontinued business have been reported separately from continuing operations in all periods presented 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a discontinued operation charge of  net of a tax benefit of  to increase its environmental reserve for the remediation of a previously discontinued operation site 
preferred stock dividends

comparison of years ended december  and december  net sales 
net sales increased by  or million  from million in to million in the psg s sales increased by  or million  from million in to million in of this million increase  approximately million was attributable to the acquisitions of teletrac  pai  and lmbc 
the remaining million increase was the result of internal growth primarily in the space  electronics capital equipment and digital imaging markets 
the icg s sales increased by  or million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher sales of electronic connectors resulting from new product introductions to the industrial automation market 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit increased by  or million  from million in to million in gross profit margin increased from of net sales in to in the gross margin for the psg increased from of net sales in to in and  for the icg  remained constant at of net sales 
the improvement in the psg s gross margin was primarily due to the addition of higher margin revenue from the acquisitions of teletrac and pai  as well as from sales volume related operating efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased by  or million  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  however  sg a decreased from in to in the increase in sg a expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to the acquisitions of teletrac  pai  and lmbc 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the absorption of lower corporate overhead expense  due to the elimination of certain costs related to the former pai corporate office  over a larger sales base 
this favorable variance was partially offset by higher incentive expense related to a three year performance plan established for the former owners  and now employee managers  of teletrac 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses increased by  or million  from million in to million in the increase in r d expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of teletrac and pai 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by  or million  from million in to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from the acquisitions of teletrac during and  pai and lmbc during this increase was substantially offset by reductions of debt during from the company s stock offering in late october and cash generated from operations 
taxes 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in to in  primarily due to a higher effective state tax rate 
preferred stock dividends 
preferred stock dividends decreased by  or million  from million in to million in the decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to the company s exchange of preferred stock for common stock and subsequent redemption of remaining preferred stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of such redemption  there is no preferred stock outstanding and there are no accrued and unpaid dividends 
backlog a substantial portion of the company s business is of a build to order nature requiring various engineering  manufacturing  testing and other processes to be performed prior to shipment 
as a result  the company generally has a significant backlog of orders to be shipped 
the company s backlog of orders decreased by or million  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in backlog was primarily due to a decline in orders from the electronics capital equipment and space markets 
the decline in the electronics capital equipment market is due primarily to the continuing difficulties in the asian economy and specific weakness in the data storage and semiconductor segments of that market 
the decline in bookings from the space market is primarily due to the timing of major satellite programs 
although the company s backlog of orders to the digital imaging market at december  is higher than the prior year end  there has been a slowdown in the order rate during the fourth quarter of which has continued into the early months of this slowdown reflects a general softness in the digital imaging market 
the company believes that a substantial portion of the backlog of orders at december  will be shipped over the next twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations primarily from cash flow generated by operations and  to a lesser extent  from borrowings under its credit facility and through capital lease transactions 
net cash provided by operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in from was primarily due to an increase in working capital primarily as a result of decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and cash payments 
the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to low accruals for incentive compensation 
the improvement in cash provided from operations from to was primarily due to increases in net income as adjusted for the realization of tax loss carryforwards and non cash amortization and depreciation

partially offsetting capital expenditures and the advance to wtc were net proceeds from the sale of the sensor systems business segment of million in  which includes a tax benefit of million 
during  the company acquired teletrac for cash consideration of million 
the cash provided by investing activities in was generated primarily from the sale of a subsidiary of pai for cash consideration of million 
this cash source was partially offset by the acquisitions of pai and lmbc for cash consideration of million and million  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities for the years ended  and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  in addition to payments under the credit facility  industrial revenue bonds and capital lease obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements  the company expended million to repurchase  shares of its common stock in open market transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  based on an evaluation of available lease terms and other factors  the company may continue to finance a portion of its capital expenditures through capital leases 
the company has an million senior secured revolving credit facility which expires on april  the credit facility  of which million was outstanding as of december  the credit facility contains restrictive covenants which  among other things  impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of additional liens and indebtedness  mergers  consolidations and specified sale of assets and requires the company to meet certain financial tests including minimum levels of earnings and net worth and various other financial ratios 
in addition  the credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
the company believes that the remaining availability under the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance its future capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and the purchase of additional company common stock for at least the next months 
year the company is continuously monitoring year compliance issues effecting its information technology it and non it systems 
no significant non it system year compliance issues have been identified 
as related to it systems  the company is in the process of implementing new management information systems at three of its business units 
while the implementation of these new systems does address year concerns  year compliance was not the predominant justification supporting such investments 
these new it systems are expected to enhance future operations through improved operating management and efficiencies 
it is anticipated that the new systems will be fully operational by the end of the first quarter of the cost of these new systems is projected to be approximately million of which million will be capitalized and depreciated over future periods 
approximately million has been spent through december   including million spent in substantial progress has been made on the implementation of these new management information systems and no unmanageable problems have been identified 
in addition  the projected completion date for these implementations allows adequate time to identify and correct potential hardware or software problems that may arise 
as such  no further contingency plans have been formulated 
the company is in the process of surveying material third parties such as customers  vendors  banks and others to determine their year readiness 
while it is not possible to fully assess the actual readiness of these third parties  a majority of their responses indicate that they are or will be year compliant 
for those vendors who have not responded satisfactorily  alternative sources will be identified

risk factors this filing contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements regarding the increasing performance demands in the defense  space  high end digital imaging  electronics capital equipment and other markets served by the company  the company s ability to integrate its existing technologies and realign its direct sales organizations  the company s ability to implement its strategy to develop and sell value added systems  the continuation of trends favoring outsourcing of the design and manufacturing of subsystems and systems by customers  the receipt and shipment of orders by the company  the company s objective to grow through strategic acquisitions and anticipated expenditures for environmental remediation 
discussion containing such forward looking statements is found in the material set forth under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as within the filing generally 
the factors discussed below could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed in or implied in such statements 
the company cautions the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
the following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing 
substantial variability of quarterly results of operations factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  domestic and foreign general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the industries served by the company could cause substantial variations in the company s operating results 
the defense  space  high end digital imaging  electronics capital equipment and industrial automation markets  each of which represents a significant market for the company s products  have historically been subject to substantial economic fluctuations due to changing demands for their products and services  introduction of new products and product obsolescence 
there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not reoccur and have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual operating results due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  timing and shipment of significant orders  mix of products sold  length of sales cycles  plant openings and closings  the timing of acquisitions or dispositions by the company  delays in raw materials shipments  completion of large projects  other manufacturing delays and disruptions  the level of backlog of orders  domestic and foreign general economic conditions and cyclicality in the markets the company serves 
to some extent  the company s net sales and operating results for a quarter will depend upon the company generating orders to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is received 
the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated rescheduling or cancellations of shipments by customers or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  may cause net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations for such quarter 
see business market overview and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  technological change and new product development the company s success will continue to depend in substantial part upon its ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and to apply appropriate levels of engineering  research and development resources necessary to keep pace with such developments 
in addition  the company s success will depend on how well the company responds to changes in customer requirements and achieves market acceptance for its products and capabilities 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in order to develop new products successfully  the company is dependent upon close relationships with its customers and their willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue to provide it with timely access to such information or that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or their enhancements 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the new products and services or their enhancements  if any  developed by the company  will achieve market acceptance 
see business business strategy and business engineering  research and development 
industry concentration  cyclicality a significant portion of the company s business and business development efforts are concentrated in the defense and  to a lesser extent  electronics capital equipment industries 
the company s business depends  in significant part  upon the us government s continued demand in the area of defense for high end  high performance components and subsystems of the type manufactured by the company 
approximately of net sales in and of net sales in were derived directly from contracts with the us government  or agencies or departments thereof  or indirectly from subcontracts with us government contractors 
the majority of these government contracts are subject to termination and renegotiation 
as a result  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially affected by changes in us government expenditures for defense 
additionally  the company currently intends to continue to develop the portion of its business dependent upon manufacturers in the electronics capital equipment industry which provides equipment used in the semiconductor  mass data storage and flat panel display industries 
such business development will depend  in part  upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of electronics capital equipment  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor  mass data storage and flat panel display devices 
the semiconductor  mass data storage and flat panel display industries have been highly volatile and historically have experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
there can be no assurance that this volatility will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business in the electronics capital equipment industry 
see business market overview  customers and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  competition the markets for the company s products are competitive 
the company competes primarily on the basis of its ability to design and engineer its products to meet performance specifications set by its customers  most of whom are oems who purchase component parts or subsystems for inclusion in their end products 
product pricing and quality  customer support  experience  reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors 
there is a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of precision optical and positioning components and subsystems and electrical electronic interconnect devices manufactured and sold by the company 
these competitors  especially those in the precision optical and positioning product lines  are typically focused on a smaller number of product offerings than the company  and are often well entrenched 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features  or that new processes or technologies will not emerge that render the company s products less competitive or obsolete 
in addition  as a result of the substantial investment required by a customer to integrate capital equipment into a production line  or to integrate components and subsystems into a product design  the company believes that once a customer has selected certain capital equipment or certain components or subsystems from a particular vendor  the customer generally relies upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific production line or product application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other capital equipment or component or subsystem requirements 
accordingly  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to a prospective customer if that customer utilizes a competitor s manufacturing equipment or components or subsystems 
further  there are numerous competitors in markets to which the company distributes precision ball bearings 
these competitors  who vary in size  include other ball bearings distributors as well as ball bearing manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the bases of competition in the industries in which the company competes will not shift or that the company will continue to compete successfully 
see business competition and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  risks of international sales and purchases the company s international sales accounted for approximately   and of the company s net sales for  and  respectively 
in addition  certain of the company s products are sold to domestic customers who use them in products they sell to international markets 
also  the company purchases a substantial portion of its ball bearings products from a single foreign supplier and certain other products from other foreign suppliers 
the company s international sales and purchases are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including general economic conditions  import and export duties and restrictions  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management of expanded operations  acquisitions in recent years  the company has made several acquisitions of complementary businesses which the company continues to integrate 
this integration strategy includes the development and sale of value added systems incorporating the company s various technological capabilities 
the development of such systems is in its early stages 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and selling such systems 
in addition  as part of the company s business development strategy  the company plans to pursue further acquisitions in order to expand the company s product offerings  add to or enhance its base of technical or sales personnel  or provide desirable customer relationships 
such growth could result in a significant strain on the company s managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
the rate of the company s future expansion  if any  in combination with the complexity of the technologies involved in the company s business  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting the operational needs of the company as well as the needs of its customers 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire complementary businesses on a cost effective basis  or integrate acquired operations into its organization effectively  retain and motivate key personnel  or retain customers of acquired firms 
the company competes for attractive acquisition candidates with other companies or investors  and such competition could have the effect of increasing the cost to the company of pursuing its acquisition strategy or reducing the number of attractive candidates to be acquired 
although the company reviews and considers possible acquisitions on an on going basis  no specific acquisitions are being negotiated or planned as of the date of this filing 
see business business strategy 
dependence on key suppliers a significant portion of the company s precision machining business related to the commercial space market depends on the adequate supply of specialty metals  such as beryllium  at competitive prices and on reasonable terms 
the company currently procures all of its beryllium from brush wellman  the sole us supplier  and the company expects to continue to rely on brush wellman for beryllium for the foreseeable future 
although the company has not experienced significant problems with this supplier in the past  there can be no assurance that such relationship will continue or that the company will continue to obtain such supplies at cost levels that would not adversely affect the company s gross margins 
the partial or complete loss of brush wellman as a supplier of beryllium  or production shortfalls or interruptions that otherwise impair the supply of beryllium to the company  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
it is uncertain whether alternative sources of supply could be developed without a material disruption in the company s ability to provide beryllium products to its customers 
although the company has not experienced significant problems with its other suppliers in the past  there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue or that  in the event of a termination of its relationships with such other suppliers  it would be able to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in the company s ability to provide products to its customers 
in addition  the company purchases a substantial part of the ball bearings it distributes from a single foreign supplier 
any material disruption in the company s supply of products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business raw materials  suppliers 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of its key executive officers  including its chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and other senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company maintains  and is the beneficiary of  a life insurance policy on the life of its chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the face amount of such policy is million 
the company does not maintain key man life insurance on its other executive officers 
in addition  since the continued success of the company is largely dependent upon its ability to design  manufacture and sell high performance components and subsystems for the high performance technology market  the company is particularly dependent upon its ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical personnel  including engineers  with the requisite educational background and industry experience  as well as skilled precision machining personnel 
the company s employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time  and competition for such personnel is intense 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing personnel 
the loss of the services of a significant number of the company s technical or skilled personnel  or the future inability to attract such personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property rights the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
the company relies upon a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  non disclosure agreements and other forms of intellectual property protection to safeguard certain of its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by these patents or as to the likelihood that patents will be issued for pending applications 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the confidentiality of its trade secrets or that its non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of the company s trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competitors in the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make and sell some of its products 
although the company believes that its existing products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company or that such claims will not be successful

environmental regulation the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its engineering  research and development and manufacturing activities 
failure to comply with applicable environmental requirements could result in substantial liability to the company  suspension or cessation of the company s operations  restrictions on the company s ability to expand its operations or requirements for the acquisition of additional equipment or other significant expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance i that changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or regulatory policy  or the discovery of unknown problems or conditions  will not in the future require substantial expenditures  or ii as to the extent of the company s liabilities  if any  for past failures  if any  to comply with applicable environmental laws  regulations and permits  any of which also could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
during  the company recorded a charge to discontinued operations of  before a tax benefit of  relating to increases in reserves for certain environmental costs associated with a formerly owned property 
the reserve established assumes that certain approvals will be received from state regulatory authorities 
however  there can be no assurance that such approvals will be received 
if such approvals are not received  costs would increase substantially 
in addition  even if such approvals are received  the costs actually incurred may exceed the reserves established 
see business environmental regulation 
the company has made and continues to make investments in protective equipment  process controls  manufacturing procedures and training in order to minimize the risks to employees  surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of hazardous materials 
the failure to properly handle such materials could lead to harmful exposure to employees or to the discharge of certain hazardous waste materials  and  since the company does not carry environmental impairment insurance  to a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that environmental problems will not develop in the future which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

continued investment required to maintain manufacturing capabilities the company has invested  and intends to continue to invest  in state of the art equipment in order to increase  expand  update or relocate its manufacturing capabilities and facilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established manufacturing capabilities will require further investment 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient funds from operations to finance any required investment or that other sources of funding will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any further expansion will not negatively impact the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

control of company by existing shareholder the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company owns approximately of the outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  he will have the ability to exert significant influence with respect to corporate actions  including the election of directors and certain sales or mergers and acquisitions involving the company 
on november  the company s chairman the chairman submitted a proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of common stock not already owned by him at a price of per share 
the chairman withdrew this proposal on january  after the company received an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding common stock at a price of per share 
possible volatility of share price the price of the common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
that price volatility may be attributable  at least in part  to the limited number of shares generally available for sale in the public market 
in addition  factors such as actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in financial results  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products or services and the timing of announcements of acquisitions or dispositions by the company or its competitors  as well as conditions in the company s markets generally  may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
furthermore  the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies and which sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performances of such companies 
after receiving an unsolicited proposal to acquire the company for per share in cash in january  the company s board of directors directed its investment bankers to explore a potential sale of the company 
there can be no assurance that a sale of the company will result from this process 
the outcome of the sale process  however  could have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
effect of certain anti takeover provisions the company s certificate of incorporation  as amended the certificate of incorporation  the company s by laws the by laws and the delaware general corporation law dgcl contain certain provisions which could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to the interests of the shareholders  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of the company 
the company has authorized  shares of its preferred stock  none of which are currently outstanding  and which the company could issue without further shareholder approval and upon such terms and conditions  and having such rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
the company has no current plans to issue any preferred stock 
the by laws include provisions establishing advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and director nominations  and permitting the calling of special shareholder meetings only by the written consent of three quarters of the board of directors or the chairman of the board 
the certificate of incorporation provides that in lieu of a meeting  action may be taken by written consent of the company s shareholders only by unanimous consent 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company  and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of common stock 
in addition  the company is subject to section of the dgcl which  subject to certain exceptions  restricts certain transactions and outstanding voting stock an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company without action by the shareholders and  therefore  could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
in the event of a change of control of the company  the vesting of outstanding options issued under the company s long term stock incentive plan may be accelerated at the discretion of the committee or may be required to be accelerated under certain circumstances provided for in each incentive agreement 
absence of dividends on common stock the company does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
the company s credit facility prohibits it from paying cash dividends on its common stock
