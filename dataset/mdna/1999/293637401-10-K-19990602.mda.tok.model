item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of cabletron s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements relating to  among other things  estimates of economic and industry conditions  sales trends  expense levels and capital expenditures 
actual results may vary from those contained in such forward looking statements 
see business environment and risk factors below 
results of operations this table sets forth the company s net sales  cost of sales  expenses by category  income loss from operations  interest income  income loss before income taxes and net income loss expressed as percentages of net sales  for the fiscal years ended february   and net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative fixed asset loss special charges income loss from operations interest income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales net sales for the year ended february  increased by to  million from  million in the year ended february  and compared to  million in the year ended february  net sales within the united states domestic  in the year ended february   were million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  domestic net sales declined due to continued price competitiveness resulting in lower prices and the decline in sales of shared technology products not fully offset by the increase in sales of switched media products 
net sales outside the united states in the year ended february  were million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  in addition to the company s direct international sales force  the company sells its products through several reseller channels and international distributors 
the increase in international net sales in fiscal compared to the year ended february  reflects a full year of dnpg compaq activity and the company s emphasis on managing global operations 
the increase reflects growth rates of and in the pac rim region and europe  respectively  offset by a reduction in other international sales  primarily latin america 
the increase in international net sales in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  reflected growth in all major international regions 
the company s international net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the periods presented 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net sales in future periods 
the overall increase in the year ended february  net sales compared to the year ended february  net sales was due to increases in the sales of switched products  software and professional services 
the current year also included a full year of dnpg compaq sales  largely contributing to the increase in sales of switched products 
sales of shared media and other products  including similiar dnpg compaq products  decreased throughout the year and relative to the prior year 
sales of switched products increased to million in the year ended february  compared to sales of million in the year ended february  the increase in sales of switched products was a result of increasing unit sales primarily related to the smartswitch products 
prices per product decreased slightly for some of the older switched products during the year ended february   but shipments of new products offset this slight price decline 
sales of the company s shared media products decreased to million in the year ended february  compared to sales of million in the year ended february  sales of shared media products steadily decreased throughout the year ended february  sales of shared media products  during the second half of the year ended february   were approximately million as a result of both declining unit shipments and lower prices per product 
the company expects the decrease in sales of its shared media products to continue in fiscal as customers continue the migration from shared media products to switched products 
the pricing environment has been very competitive and has caused significant price erosion in the company s older products 
sales of software  professional services and other were million or of total net sales in the year ended february   compared to million or of total sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  the company is focused on supplying customers with advanced software packages that include the applicable software programs  installation  training and maintenance services as one product 
this bundled product will become an integral part of cabletron s customer development and support activities 
during the year ended february   management intends to offer customers more advanced software packages and to attempt to increase service revenue by continuing to emphasize this portion of the business 
as part of the company s acquisition of dnpg  the company agreed to appoint digital as the service provider for the company s products in certain smaller countries  where the company did not already have a significant investment in services 
this appointment has not had a significant effect on the growth of the company s own service and support organization 
the slight decrease in net sales in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  was largely a result of a decrease in sales of the company s shared media products 
sales of the company s shared media products decreased to million in the year ended february  compared to sales of million in the year ended february  the decline in revenue of shared media products was a result of both declining unit shipments and lower prices per product 
the decrease in sales of shared media products was offset somewhat by an increase in sales of the company s switched products comprised primarily of the smartswitch   and products 
sales of switched products increased to million in the year ended february  compared to sales of million in fiscal the increase in sales of switched products was a result of increasing unit sales 
prices per product decreased slightly for switched products during the year ended february   but the increase in unit shipments offset this slight price decline 
gross profit  expenses and interest income gross profit was million or in the year ended february  compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  and compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  the decrease in gross profit in the year ended february   as compared to the year ended february   as a percentage of net sales reflects the impact on pricing from increased sales to channel resellers and independent distributors rather than selling directly to the end user and a more competitive pricing environment  additionally  the shift from shared media to switch products resulted in higher inventory obsolesence 
the company s decrease in gross profit in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  was due to pricing pressures  especially in the company s foreign markets which traditionally carried a higher margin  and also to increased inventory write offs 
the company was able to maintain a consistent gross margin in the year ended february   as compared to prior years  by introducing and selling products with improved functionality  further developing its service maintenance program and improving purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies 
in the future  the company s gross profit may be affected by the same factors as the year ended february   including the price per product sold  inventory obsolescence  the distribution channels used  price competition  the mix of products sold  the acquisition of newer products at different margins and the result of the anticipated savings recognized through its outsourcing of the manufacturing process 
research and development r d expenses in the year ended february  increased to million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  the increased r d  in the year ended february   reflected higher spending due to the addition of software and hardware engineering personnel  directly hired and as a result of the company s acquisitions  and the associated costs related to development of new products and the next generation of existing products 
the increased r d spending in fiscal  as compared to the year ended february   reflected the company s ongoing research and development efforts  including the further development of the smartswitch family of products  spectrum management software as well as the increase in the hiring of additional software and hardware engineers and associated costs related to development of new products 
r d spending increased as a percentage of net sales in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  primarily because net sales were lower than the company expected in the year ended february  the company plans to continue emphasizing research and development as a critical strategy for the company 
in the future  the company will attempt to reduce r d spending as a percentage of net sales similar to the percentage levels prior to the year ended february  the company plans to continue to develop new products through a combination of internal development efforts  minority investments in independent companies and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that research and development efforts or acquisitions of technology will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  or that such technology and products will be introduced in time to meet market requirements 
the company s research and development efforts may be adversely affected by other factors discussed more fully below in business environment and risk factors 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in the year ended february   compared to million or of net sales in the year ended february  and million or of net sales in the year ended february  these increases were a result of an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets recorded from the acquisitions  an increase in sales and technical personnel  incentive payments to employees added through the acquisitions and increased marketing programs 
sg a expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal primarily as a result of lower than expected sales 
the company expects to focus more of the future sg a expenditures on core spending  advertising and marketing to potential customers  for revenue generation  and the company expects that sg a expenses will include more amortization expense in the year ended february   due to a full year of amortization expense for acquisitions completed during the year ended february   as compared to fiscal  while other components of sg a will remain approximately constant  in absolute dollars  in the upcoming year 
in the fourth quarter of the year ended february   the company performed a physical inventory of manufacturing equipment and fixtures in preparation for the planned outsourcing of its manufacturing operations 
as a result of this inventory  the company wrote off approximately million of assets 
the writeoff consisted of equipment and fixtures that could not be located million and equipment recently idled with no future value 
in the year ended february   special charges were taken for in process research and development related to the acquisition of yago systems  inc million  the dslam division of ariel corporation million  flowpoint corp 
million and netvantage  inc million 
in the year ended february   special charges were taken for in process research and development related to the acquisition of the dnpg million and the implementation of a realignment plan million  totaling million 
in the year ended february   a million special charge was taken for the acquisitions of zeitnet  network express  netlink and the oasys group 
net interest income in the year ended february  was million compared to million in the year ended february  and compared to million in the year ended february  the decrease of net interest income in the year ended february  as compared to fiscal is a result of lower cash available for short term investments caused by compaq s utilization of product credits in place of cash to settle accounts receivable and cash used to fund acquisitions 
the slight decrease in interest income in the year ended february  is primarily the result of lower interest rates than in the year ended february  income loss before taxes loss before taxes was million in the year ended february   compared to million in the year ended february  and income before taxes of million in the year ended february  in the year ended february   the company recorded a fixed asset loss of million  and recorded special charges of million for in process research development  consisting of i netvantage  inc for million  ii flowpoint corp 
for million  iii the dslam division of ariel corporation for million and iv yago systems  inc for million 
in fiscal  the company recorded special charges of million  consisting of i in process research and development of million in connection with the acquisition of the dnpg  and ii charges relating to the company s realignment of million 
in the year ended february   the company s recorded special charges related to acquisitions of million 
the increase in loss before taxes in the year ended february  was due to lower gross profit margins as the company continued its migration from shared media products to switched products and higher personnel costs in r d departments more than offsetting the decrease in special charges 
the decrease in income before taxes in the year ended february  was due primarily to the increase of million in special charges 
excluding special charges  loss before taxes was million in the year ended february   compared to income before taxes of million in the year ended february   and million in the year ended february  the decrease in income before taxes in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  was also due to lower revenues and higher cost of sales 
the factors affecting net sales and cost of sales are discussed above 
income tax expense benefit excluding the effects of special charges  the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended february   for the year ended february  and for the year ended february  the income tax benefit was million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in the year ended february  and million of income tax expense in the year ended february  the tax benefit decreased in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  due to fewer tax deductible charges related to acquisitions and other corporate charges 
the year ended february  income tax benefit included a million tax benefit related to the acquisition of ariel and a million tax benefit related to the fixed asset loss 
the year ended february  income tax benefit included million related to the acquisition of dnpg and million related to the company s realignment 
the year ended february  income tax expense was incurred due to net income after special charges 
net loss was million in the year ended february   compared to net loss of million in the year ended february  and net income of million in the year ended february  realignment the company announced on december  a global initiative to better align the company s business strategy with its focus in the enterprise and service provider markets 
the realignment is intended to better position the company to provide more solutions oriented products and service  to increase its distribution of products through third party distributors and resellers  to improve its position internationally and to aggressively develop partnership and acquisition opportunities 
the company incurred a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million million  net of tax related to the realignment 
the realignment included general expense reduction through the elimination of duplicate facilities  consolidation of related operations  reallocation of resources  including the elimination of certain existing projects  and personnel reduction 
during fiscal  the company completed the reductions required to better align its global initiative 
business combinations acquisitions yago systems  inc in connection with the acquisition of yago  the company allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of yago s next generation switching router family of products and technologies 
at the time of its acquisition  yago was a development stage company that had spent approximately million on research and development focused on the development of advanced gigabit switching technology 
in fact  all of yago s efforts since the company s inception had been directed towards the introduction of an advanced gigabit layer  layer  and layer switching and router product family 
yago had no developed products or technology and had not generated any revenues as of its acquisition date 
at the time  yago was testing the technology related to the msr  its first product to be released  and was developing its msr family of products 
these two primary development efforts were made up of six significant research and development components  which were ongoing at the acquisition date 
these component efforts included continued msr development and testing  research and development of the msr a desktop version of the msr  development of the msr  development of wide area network interfaces for its switching products  routing software research and development  and device management software research and development 
at the time of yago s acquisition  the company believed that the msr product family of switching routers would set a new standard for performance and functionality by delivering wire speed layer  layer and layer functionality 
designed for the enterprise and isp backbone markets  upon completion of their development  the msr products were intended to offer large table capacity  a multi gigabit non blocking backplane  low latency and seamless calling 
yago also intended to develop its msr products to be interoperable with other standard based routers and switches 
as of the acquisition date  management expected the development of the msr product family would be the only mechanism to fuel yago s revenue growth and profitability in the future 
despite the incomplete state of yago s technology  the company felt that the projected size and growth of the market for the msr product  yago s demonstrated promise in the development of the msr product family and the consideration paid by cabletron s competitors to acquire companies comparable to yago all warranted the consideration paid by cabletron for yago 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress were expected to occur over the next two years  the company expected to begin generating the economic benefits from the technologies in the second half of funding for such projects was expected to be obtained from internally generated sources 
expenditures to complete the msr technology were expected to total approximately million over the next two years 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
in the model used to value in process research and development in the yago acquisition  as of march   total revenues attributable to yago were projected to exceed million in  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  yago had no existing products and accordingly all revenue growth in the first several years were related to the in process technologies 
the estimated revenues for the in process were projected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were projected to enter the market 
cost of sales was estimated based on yago s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the market opportunities in the gigabit ethernet arena and yago s unique product architecture substantial gross margins are expected through thereafter  gross margins are expected to gradually decline as competition increases 
cost of sales was projected to average approximately percent through sg a expenses including depreciation  was projected to remain constant as a percentage of sales at approximately percent 
r d expenditures were projected to decrease as a percentage of sales as the in process projects were completed 
r d expenditures were expected to peak in at percent of sales  decline  and then level out at percent of sales in and thereafter 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were used for the business enterprise and for the in process r d 
the company believes these rates were appropriate because they were commensurate with yago s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
the company s assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
management expects to continue their support of these efforts and believes the company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any will meet with either technological or commercial success 
the company believes as it did at the time of the yago acquisition  that if yago does not successfully complete its outstanding in process research and development efforts  cabletron s future operating results would be materially adversely impacted and the value of the in process research and development might never be realized 
dslam division of ariel corporation on september   cabletron acquired the assets and liabilities of the dslam division of ariel corporation ariel 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including fees  expenses and other costs related to the acquisition 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the dslam division of ariel corporation from the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of ariel  the company allocated million million  net of tax of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
the valuation of the in process research and development ipr d incorporated the guidance on ipr d valuation methodologies recently promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec 
these methodologies incorporate the notion that cash flows attributable to development efforts  including the effort to be completed on the development effort underway  and development of future versions of the product that have not yet been undertaken  should be excluded in the valuation of ipr d

ariel s in process research and development value is comprised of several significant individual on going projects 
remaining development efforts for these projects include various phases of design  development and testing 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress are estimated to occur over the next year 
the company projected to begin generating the economic benefits from the technologies in the second half of fiscal year funding for such projects was estimated to be obtained from internally generated sources

netvantage s in process research and development value is comprised of several significant individual on going projects 
remaining development efforts for these projects include various phases of design  development and testing 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress are estimated to occur over the next year 
the company began recognizing the economic benefits from the technologies in the fourth quarter of fiscal year funding for such projects was estimated to be obtained from internally generated sources 
expenditures to complete these projects were estimated to total approximately million over the next year 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
management expects to continue their support of these efforts and believes the company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any will meet with either technological or commercial success 
acquisitions in connection with the acquisition of npg  the company allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of npg s next generation switch  hub  adapter  and internetworking technologies 
the incomplete projects related to switch technology included  among other efforts  the introduction of fast ethernet and oc technology into gigaswitch atm and gigaswitch fddi technologies  development of gigabit and fast ethernet modules for the vnswitch chassis  and the introduction of a new gigaswitch ethernet platform to provide gigabit ethernet technology 
in the internetworking area  the company had several significant efforts on going related to network management software products  new wireless remote access offerings  and web gateway technology 
the primary developmental efforts related to the adapter family of products involved the introduction of new atm and gigabit network interface cards 
finally  in the hub family  specific r d efforts included the introduction of atm and fast ethernet modules for the dechub and the development of advanced layer switching support for the mbps hub multiswitch 
the nature of the efforts to fully develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products  technologies  and services principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress were expected to occur over the next one and one half years  at which time the company expected to begin generating economic benefits from the technologies 
funding for such projects was expected to be obtained from internally generated sources 
as of february   expenditures to complete these projects were expected to total approximately million for the remainder of calendar year and million in calendar year these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
in the model used to value npg s in process research and development  as of february   npg total revenues were projected to exceed billion in  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d programs 
estimated revenue from npg s existing technologies was expected to be million in  with a rapid decline as existing processes and know how approached obsolescence 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were estimated to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
in the model used to value npg s in process research and development  cost of sales was estimated based on npg s historical results and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
a substantial gross margin improvement was expected in due to a restructuring of npg s cost structure 
thereafter  gradual improvements were expected due to purchasing power increases and general economies of scale 
cost of sales averaged approximately percent through combined sg a and r d expenses were expected to peak in at percent of sales  decline  and level out at approximately percent of sales in and remain constant thereafter 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of percent was appropriate for the business enterprise  percent for the existing products and technology  and percent for the in process r d 
these discount rates were selected to reflect npg s corporate maturity  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
the company s assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
management expects to continue their support of these efforts and believes the company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the r d programs 
however  there has been and will continue to be risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any will meet with either technological or commercial success 
the company believes  as it did at the time of the npg acquisition  that if npg did not successfully complete its outstanding in process research and development efforts  cabletron s future operating results could be materially impacted and the value of the in process research and development might never be realized 
acquisitions during the year ended february   the company augmented its product line and expanded its markets by acquiring zeitnet inc  a manufacturer of atm products  in july  network express  inc  a manufacturer of remote access equipment  in august  netlink  inc  a manufacturer of frame relay products  in december  and the oasys group  inc  a software developer  in february liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments increased to million at february  from million at february  net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february   and compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended february  was a result of improved inventory controls that resulted in a reduction in inventory  improved collections from customers being partially offset by compaq utilizing product credits received in its acquisition of dnpg 
compaq can use the product credits through february  to purchase certain cabletron products that are ordered under the reseller agreement 
see note notes to the consolidated financial statements included at page of this document for additional details regarding the product credits 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities between the year ended february  and the year ended february  was primarily a result of higher inventories  higher purchased research and development through acquisitions and increased deferred taxes 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  the increased use of cash in investing activities is primarily due to increased purchases of securities 
this increase was partially offset by less cash paid net for acquisitions during fiscal  million as compared to million in the year ended february   less capital expenditures and the proceeds from the sale of a duplicate facility which the company acquired from dnpg for cash totaling million 
capital expenditures have decreased steadily during the three year period ended february  due to the decreased need for additional facilities and manufacturing equipment  as sales have remained relatively flat 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million at february  or days sales outstanding  compared to million or days of sales outstanding at february  this decrease in receivables reflects compaq s use of product credits  which reduces days sales outstanding because the company deems purchases paid in product credits to be collected immediately and  secondarily  to the increased collection efforts of the company 
these trends are expected to continue as compaq has product credits available until february  and the company has focused their sales efforts through resellers and distributors 
during fiscal  the company sold slightly more than half of its products to resellers and distributors 
the company has been able to monitor these relationships and improved the efficiency of collections as there are fewer resellers and distributors than the number of end users the company shipped to during fiscal worldwide inventories were million at february  or days of inventory  compared to million or days of inventory at the end of the preceding fiscal year 
the decrease of days in inventory was due to improved inventory control performance and increased reserves for inventory in connection with the transition from shared media products to switched products 
the company s use of distributors and resellers has allowed the company to maintain lower inventory levels  while the distributors and resellers will be able to service the end user customers  in a timely manner 
the company expects inventory levels to decrease as it outsources its manufacturing process 
during the year ended february   capital expenditures were million  which were principally related to upgrades of computers  computer related and manufacturing equipment 
during the year ended february   capital expenditures were million  which were primarily related to software and hardware products and upgrades of computers 
capital expenditures for the year ended february  were million  which were primarily related to engineering computer hardware and software 
on march  the company obtained a million revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank  first national bank of chicago and several other lenders 
the facility has a term of three years 
as of february   the company had not drawn down any money under the facility 
in the opinion of management  internally generated funds from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds to support the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
business environment and risk factors the following are cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of the company s future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings and press releases made by the company and in oral statements made by the officers of the company 
actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
therefore  no assurances can be given that the results in such forward looking statements will be achieved 
important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statements include  among others  the factors mentioned below 
competition 
the data networking industry is intensely competitive and subject to increasing consolidation 
competition in the data networking industry has increased in recent periods  and cabletron expects competition to continue to increase significantly in the future from its current competitors  as well as from potential competitors that may enter cabletron s existing or future markets 
cabletron s competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies  as well as emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets such as those addressed by cabletron 
cabletron s primary competitors in the data networking industry are cisco systems  inc  fore systems  inc  lucent technologies  inc  northern telecom ltd 
and com corporation 
several large telecommunications equipment companies  including nokia corp  alcatel  ericsson and siemens have begun to compete in the data networking industry and have recently made investments in or acquired several smaller data networking companies 
companies in the data networking industry compete upon the basis of price  technology  and brand recognition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect cabletron s business  financial condition  and operating results and increase fluctuations in operating results 
competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that offer greater performance or functionality than cabletron s products 
there can be no assurance that cabletron will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products or that cabletron will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
any failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the data networking industry has grown and matured  customers purchasing decisions have been increasingly influenced by brand recognition 
if cabletron is unable to develop competitive brand recognition  cabletron s business may be adversely affected 
cabletron s current and potential competitors have pursued and are continuing to pursue a strategy of acquiring data networking companies possessing advanced networking technologies 
the acquisition of these companies allows cabletron s competitors to offer new products without the lengthy time delays associated with internal product development 
as a consequence  competitors are able to more quickly meet the demand for advanced networking capabilities  as well as for so called end to end networking solutions 
these acquisitions also permit potential competitors  such as telecommunications companies  who lack data networking products and technologies  to more quickly enter data networking markets 
the greater resources of the competitors engaged in these acquisitions may permit them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases 
there is significant competition among cabletron and its competitors for the acquisition of data networking companies possessing advanced technologies 
as a consequence of this competition  as well as other factors  the prices paid to acquire such companies is typically extremely high relative to the assets and sales of such companies 
the greater resources of cabletron s current and potential competitors may enable them to compete more effectively for the acquisition of such companies 
in addition to acquiring other companies  cabletron s competitors frequently invest in early stage data networking companies in order to secure access to advanced technologies under development by such companies  to enhance the ability to subsequently acquire such companies and to deter other competitors from obtaining such access or performing such acquisitions 
cabletron expects that competition will increase substantially as a result of the continuing industry consolidations 
in the past  cabletron has relied upon a combination of internal product development and partnerships with other networking vendors to broaden its product line to meet the demand for end to end enterprise wide solutions 
acquisitions of or investments in other data networking companies by cabletron s competitors may limit cabletron s access to commercially significant technologies  and thus its ability to offer products that meet its customers needs 
see acquisition strategy 
in addition to the effects of competition  cabletron s margins may also decrease as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower margin products  increased sales through lower margin distributor and reseller sales channels  increased component costs and increased expenses  which may be necessary in future periods to meet the demands of greater competition and if the expected cost savings from outsourcing the manufacturing process is not achieved 
for example  as a result of various acquisitions completed during fiscal  the company acquired products that contribute a lower gross margin than the company s core products have historically contributed 
additionally  as a result of the dnpg acquisition and other business strategy initiatives  cabletron achieved a higher percentage of its sales through resellers  which may have the effect of reducing cabletron s margin on those sales  as well as  to a lesser extent  cabletron s overall margins 
margins in any given period may be adversely affected by additional factors 
see business environment and risk factors fluctuations in operating results 
fluctuations in operating results 
a variety of factors may cause period to period fluctuations in the operating results of cabletron 
such factors include  but are not limited to i the rate of growth of the markets for cabletron s products  ii competitive pressures  including pricing  brand and technological competition  iii availability of components  including unique integrated circuits  iv adverse effects of delays in the establishment of industry standards  including delays or reductions in customer orders  delays in new product introductions and increased expenses associated with standards compliance  v delays by cabletron in the introduction of new or enhanced products  vi changes in product mix  vii delays or reductions in customer purchases in anticipation of the introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors and viii instability of the international markets in which cabletron sells its products 
for example  cabletron has been experiencing decreased sales for its older line of so called shared media products 
the period to period rate of decrease has been greater in certain periods than in others and has been difficult to predict 
backlog as of any particular date is not indicative of future revenue due  in part  to the possibility of order cancellations  customer requested delivery delays  shifting purchasing patterns and inventory level variability 
in particular  cabletron has been experiencing longer sales cycles for its core products as a result of the increasing dollar amount of customer orders and longer customer planning cycles 
also  cabletron has experienced backend loading of its quarterly sales  making the predictability of the quarterly results highly speculative 
these factors  together with increased competition  have led to an increase in sales variability and a decrease in cabletron s ability to predict aggregate sales demand for any given period 
these factors have increased the possibility that the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely affected by the failure to obtain or delays in obtaining a limited number of large customer orders  due  for example  to cancellations  delays or deferrals by customers 
if growth in cabletron s revenues in any quarter fails to match cabletron s expectations  its earnings and margins would be materially adversely affected 
during the year ended february   the company incurred higher inventory obsolescence and a more competitive pricing environment which resulted in lower gross margins  additionally sales to channel resellers and distributors have also contributed to the lower gross margin 
there can be no assurance that net sales will not decrease in future periods 
any decrease in net sales could have a material adverse affect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  cabletron may not be able to adjust expense levels to match any shortfall in revenues 
as the industry becomes more competitive and standards based  cabletron is facing greater price competition from its competitors 
if cabletron does not respond with lower production costs  pricing pressures could adversely affect future earnings 
accordingly  past results may not be indicative of future results 
there can be no assurance that the announcement or introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors  or a change in industry standards  will not cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of cabletron s existing products  which could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the market for cabletron s products is evolving 
the rate of growth of the market and the resulting demand for cabletron s recently introduced products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than anticipated  cabletron s business  financial condition or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because of the global nature of cabletron s business  a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including foreign exchange rates  political and economic factors  foreign regulators and natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on future results 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 
management structure 
the company has defined and is currently implementing a new management structure 
the new management structure includes the creation of certain new senior officer positions and the realignment of certain management structures 
the implementation of the new management structures and cabletron s recent acquisitions have required the dedication of the company s existing management resources  which has resulted in a temporary disruption of cabletron s business activities 
there can be no assurance that such disruption will not continue in future quarters 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  operating results or financial condition 
over time  the loss of the personnel  facilities and other resources eliminated through the expense reductions may adversely impact cabletron s ability to generate expected revenue levels 
acquisition strategy 
cabletron has addressed the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies and businesses 
acquisitions  such as the acquisition of netvantage  flowpoint  ariel  yago and dnpg  involve numerous risks including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which competitors have established market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies businesses is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
the combination of such companies will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings and coordination of their sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be exacerbated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the efforts required to successfully integrate acquired companies require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of cabletron 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of cabletron 
the acquisition of early stage companies  such as netvantage  flowpoint  ariel and yago  poses risks in addition to those identified above 
such companies often have limited operating histories  limited or no prior sales  and may not yet have achieved profitability 
in addition  the technologies possessed by such companies are often unproven 
the development and marketing of products based upon such technologies may require the investment of substantial time and resources and  despite such investment  may not result in commercially saleable products or may not yield revenues sufficient to justify cabletron s investment 
further  aggressive competitors often undertake initiatives to attract customers and to recruit key employees of acquired companies through various incentives 
in addition to netvantage  flowpoint  ariel  yago and dnpg  cabletron has stated that it will continue to explore other possible acquisitions in the future 
multiple acquisitions during a period increases the risks identified above  including in particular the difficulty of integrating the acquired businesses and the distraction of management from the day to day business activities of cabletron 
near the end of the year ended february   the company acquired several product lines previously marketed by digital s npg pursuant to cabletron s acquisition of the npg 
cabletron s sales of the npg products are subject to numerous risks 
substantially all of npg s revenues have historically been derived from sales by digital s worldwide sales force and certain major third party resellers 
under digital  the npg had no direct sales force to end users digital s direct sales force resides in an independent business unit  and cabletron did not acquire any portion of digital s sales force 
under the reseller and services agreement dated as of november  between cabletron and digital  digital has agreed to resell certain cabletron products  including the dnpg products  and has contractually committed to purchase certain minimum volumes of cabletron products for resale and internal use 
in april  digital was acquired by compaq computer corporation compaq and compaq has assumed all of digital s obligations to cabletron 
compaq digital accounted for approximately of cabletron s revenues in the year ended february  any failure by compaq to purchase the committed product volumes would have a material adverse impact on cabletron s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  a substantial portion of the npg s revenues have historically been derived from sales through third party resellers 
cabletron has traditionally derived a smaller portion of its revenues from sales through resellers and  as a consequence  has less experience managing reseller relationships 
there can be no assurance that the compaq s resellers will continue to purchase the dnpg products from cabletron or  if they do  that the volume of such purchases will not decline significantly 
the products to be sold by cabletron through compaq s sales force and third party resellers  including the dnpg products and certain cabletron products  may be sold under the compaq brand name and  in many cases  will be specifically adapted for use in existing compaq digital hardware platforms 
the company has limited experience managing the marketing and distribution of a line of products under a brand name or for hardware platforms other than its own 
there exists no alternative market for such products 
a higher than expected rate of return from resellers  the company s failure to adequately manage the marketing and distribution of such products  or the loss of material resellers or a material decline in sales volume through the third party resellers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
volatility of stock price 
as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating the businesses of netvantage  flowpoint  ariel  yago and dnpg and other companies or businesses that have been or may in the future be acquired by cabletron  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders the average dollar amount of customer orders has increased in recent periods  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of cabletron 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of cabletron s stock in any given period 
technological changes 
the market for networking products is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions  and therefore requires a high level of expenditures for research and development 
cabletron may be required to make significant expenditures to develop such new integrated product offerings 
there can be no assurance that customer demand for products integrating routing  switching  hub  network management and remote access technologies will grow at the rate expected by cabletron  that cabletron will be successful in developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or product enhancements that respond to these customer demands or to evolving industry standards and technological change  that cabletron will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  manufacture and marketing of these products especially in light of the increasing design and manufacturing complexities associated with the integration of technologies  or that its new product and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
cabletron s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if cabletron encounters delays in developing or introducing new products or product enhancements or if such product enhancements do not gain market acceptance 
in order to maintain a competitive position  cabletron must also continue to enhance its existing products and there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
in addition  the demand for traditional shared media hubs such as cabletron s basic mmac product have been experiencing declines over the last few years  and the company expects that such decline will continue 
a portion of future revenues will come from new products and services 
cabletron cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its revenues  earnings or stock price 
product protection and intellectual property 
cabletron s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
cabletron attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements 
cabletron believes  however  that its success will depend to a greater extent upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by cabletron in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that cabletron s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to cabletron s technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect cabletron s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
no assurance can be given that any patents issued to cabletron will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages 
although cabletron does not believe that its products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties have asserted infringement and other claims against cabletron  and there can be no assurance that such claims will not be successful or that third parties will not assert such claims against cabletron in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies incorporated in cabletron s products 
since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent issues  applications may have been filed by third parties which  if issued as patents  could relate to cabletron s products 
in addition  participants in cabletron s industry also rely upon trade secret law 
cabletron could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights which could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block cabletron s ability to license its products in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on suppliers 
cabletron s products include certain components  including application specific integrated circuits asics  that are currently available from single or limited sources  some of which require long order lead times 
in addition  certain of cabletron s products and sub assemblies are manufactured by single source third parties 
with the increasing technological sophistication of new products and the associated design and manufacturing complexities  cabletron anticipates that it may need to rely on additional single source or limited suppliers for components or manufacture of products and subassemblies 
any reduction in supply  interruption or extended delay in timely supply  variances in actual needs from forecasts for long order lead time components  or change in costs of components could affect cabletron s ability to deliver its products in a timely and cost effective manner and may adversely impact cabletron s operating results and supplier relationships 
nearly all of the company s products  and the products of its subsidiaries  will be manufactured by third party contract manufacturers  beginning in fiscal the failure of a third party manufacturer to manufacture the products or to deliver the products in time for cabletron to meet its delivery requirements could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year as widely reported  many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year and  therefore  computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four  to define a specific year 
absent corrective measures  a computer program that has date sensitive software may recognize a date using as rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to various activities and operations 
as is true for most companies  the year computer issue creates a risk for the company 
if the company s products  internal systems or the systems of its suppliers do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
to address this issue  the company initiated a project to assess and address year compliance issues for its internal information systems  equipment and facilities  key suppliers and products 
with respect to the company s infrastructure and internal systems consisting of facilities  telecommunications  and the corporate network  enterprise  manufacturing and engineering systems  as well as those of third party suppliers  the phases of the project include inventorying year items  assigning priorities to identified items and assessing the year compliance of items determined to be critical to the company  remediation of critical items that are determined not to be year ready  testing critical items  and designing and implementing contingency plans 
internal information systems cabletron has largely completed the inventory and assessment phases of its main engineering  financial  manufacturing and order processing systems 
the company is in the process of remediating and testing these systems and expects to complete these phases by the end of october  and does not currently expect any significant issues to be identified during the completion of these phases 
however  the failure of any internal system to achieve year readiness could disrupt the company s ability to conduct its business or record transactions  which could adversely affect results of operations or financial condition 
equipment and facilities the company is in the final stages of contacting the suppliers of its critical equipment to ascertain the equipment s year readiness 
cabletron expects to achieve year readiness of its critical equipment by the end of september if identification of non compliant equipment and any upgrade or replacement is delayed  the company s design  production and shipping capabilities could be disrupted  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is also assessing the year readiness of its owned facilities and critical leased facilities that house large numbers of cabletron employees 
the company expects to complete remediation and testing efforts by september these facilities are critical to operations and any delays in achieving year readiness with respect to these facilities could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
key suppliers the company has completed the inventory and assessment phases of its review of cabletron s critical supplier base and  as part of the remediation phase  is in the process of reviewing the state of readiness of its critical suppliers 
this process includes compliance inquiries and reviews that will continue throughout where issues are identified with a particular supplier  contingency plans will be developed 
even where assurances are received from third parties there remains a risk that failure of systems and products of other companies on which cabletron relies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they provide to cabletron  critical materials  products and services may not be delivered in a timely manner  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
cabletron products the company has conducted extensive work regarding the status of its current  developing and installed base of products 
the company has published a list of its major products indicating their status of year compliance 
this list is available on the company s world wide web page http www 
cabletron 
com year and is updated periodically 
the company believes that substantially all of its current hardware products are year compliant 
the company believes that its older hardware products that are not year compliant will continue to perform all essential and material functions after the year but may  in limited circumstances  incorrectly report the date of events ie  events on the network that are reported to a network management software package after the year the company believes that its current version of spectrum version  its network management platform  is year compliant 
older versions of spectrum are not year compliant 
the company is offering upgrades for some  but not all  of the non compliant products both hardware and software previously sold by the company 
for those non compliant products with no upgrade available  the company is offering customers the opportunity to purchase equipment offering equivalent functionality 
given that most non compliant products previously sold will continue to perform their standard functions  the company expects that many customers will decide not to replace those products 
despite the company s efforts to date to identify the year compliance of its current and installed base of products and the effects of any non compliance  the company cannot be sure that it has identified all areas of non compliance or that any solutions it implements to address the non compliance will prove satisfactory 
further  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving third party products  the company may experience an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
for these reasons  the impact of customer claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
as used in this section  year compliant means  with respect to information technology  that the information technology  where applicable  accurately processes date time data including  but not limited to  calculating  comparing  and sequencing from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  and the years and and leap year calculations  to the extent that other information technology  used in combination with the information technology being acquired  properly exchanges date time data with it 
costs based on the work performed to date  the company has not incurred material costs 
the company presently estimates it will incur between and million of costs  of which approximately will be for capital expenditures  in connection with its year efforts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
the company s overall objective in managing its credit risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of events 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk inherent in global operations 
the company does not use utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments 
market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the hedging activity of the company is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities and the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the securities that the company classifies as held to maturity are recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities are not material 
the securities that the company classifies as available for sale are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity 
a hypothetical or basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million or million decrease  respectively approximately percent or percent  respectively in the fair market value of the securities 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
gains and losses on the contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
at february   the company had purchased forwards with a notional value of approximately million and options with a notional value of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar from february  market rates would not result in a material decrease in fair market value  earnings or cash flows 
also  any gains or losses on the contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows

while the company has made certain adjustments to its business and operations to accommodate the euro conversion  a failure to fully implement the euro conversion on the part of the european union  would not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations
