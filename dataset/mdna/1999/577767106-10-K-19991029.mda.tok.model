these sales teams are often supported by scientists  application engineers and technical specialists 
sales and marketing for the company s products in the united states  and  for industrial computers  europe  is handled directly by the company  and elsewhere the company utilizes sales representatives and distributors to assist in the marketing of its products 
the company conducts marketing programs intended to position and promote its products and services  including trade shows  seminars  advertising  public relations  distribution of product literature and web sites on the internet 
the company s operating expenses are substantially impacted by selling  general and administrative activities and by research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily driven by sales volume  with respect to sales force expenses and commission expenses  the extent of market research activities for new product design efforts  advertising and trade show activities and the number of new products launched in the period 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with the company s administrative employees  facilities and functions 
the company incurs expenses in foreign countries primarily in the functional currencies of such locations 
as a result of the company s international operations  the united states dollar amount of its revenue and expenses is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s ability to maintain and grow its sales depends on a variety of factors including its ability to maintain its competitive position in areas such as technology  performance  price  brand identity  quality  reliability  distribution and customer service and support 
the company s sales growth also depends on its ability to continue to introduce new products that respond to technological change and market demand in a timely manner 
business segments in fiscal year  maxwell adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information statement no 

the new rules establish revised standards for public companies relating to the reporting of financial information about operating segments 
the adoption of statement no 
did not have a material effect on maxwell s financial statements  although segment information disclosures were affected 
in accordance with the requirements and guidelines of statement no 
 maxwell s operations have been classified into the following business segments prior year segment information has been restated to conform to statement no 
guidelines space and technology products and programs includes design  development and manufacture of high reliability radiation hardened electronic components and consulting services for commercial and government space systems  research and development programs in pulsed power  pulsed power systems design and construction  computer based analytic services and software  and weapons effects simulation  primarily for the dod 
over the last several periods  the company has re directed some of its space effects modeling and analysis services  with expertise developed over a year period  from government to commercial programs 
the success of these activities and the size and growth potential of the commercial space market have led maxwell to focus on this business area 
to complement its consulting services  during the second quarter of this fiscal year the company acquired sei  a san diego based supplier of specially treated electronic components for use in space environments  primarily by commercial satellite manufacturers 
sei utilizes patented processes to protect computer boards and chips  either of its own design or commercially available components  from the radiation encountered in space 
the methods used by sei have the potential to result in both lower cost and increased protection for satellite systems 
the combination of maxwell s world class space effects consulting and software with the newly acquired capabilities of sei provide the company with a substantial value added foothold in the commercial space market  and the company plans to increase its presence in this area 
industrial computers and subsystems includes design and assembly of standard  custom and semi custom industrial computer modules  platforms and fully integrated systems primarily for oems 
power conversion products includes design  development and manufacture of electrical components  systems and subsystems  including products that capitalize on pulsed power such as ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and other electrical components  power distribution and conditioning systems  and emi filter capacitors 
sterilization and purification systems includes design  development and manufacture of systems based on two patented pulse power processes incorporating capacitors and other pulsed power components designed and manufactured by the company 
the purebright system utilizes intense pulsed light to kill microorganisms and viruses in water and blood plasma and other biopharmaceutical products  and on food  food packaging and medical products 
the coolpure system uses pulsed electrical fields to kill microorganisms in liquids and liquid foods  such as juices  dairy products and sauces 
results of operations for fiscal years and have been restated to include the results of acquisitions completed in fiscal year and accounted for using the pooling of interests method

expansion of the company s industrial computer business in germany and france in the current fiscal year and a full year of sales in fiscal year from the company s united kingdom operation which was acquired in fiscal year  are the primary factors relating to the increase in international sales 
sales in both fiscal years and increased over the prior year in all of the company s on going business segments  as described below 
space and technology products and programs 
in fiscal year  sales in this segment increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year the company has both enhanced and re profiled this business segment with its acquisitions of physics international  the primarily government funded pulsed power research and simulation business of primex technologies  in april  and sei  a primarily commercial  radiation tolerant satellite computer components business  in january physics international was the company s principal competitor in the simulation area  and the combined businesses consolidate scientific and technical research capabilities for the benefit of both the government and the company s technology base 
these added operations accounted for substantially all of the increase in revenue in this segment compared to fiscal year the software business recorded significantly increased sales of its new web based time card product in the latter half of the fiscal year  including sales to several large defense oriented companies and license fees under a source code license directed to the professional services market not currently served by the company 
offsetting these increases were the wind down and completion of several government programs 
the company has won certain follow on contracts  but the levels of work under such new programs were less than in the prior year 
in fiscal year  space and technology products and programs sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year a portion of this increase was in the company s core  government funded pulsed power research and development activities  including revenue from the physics international acquisition 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in fiscal year revenues compared to fiscal year at the newly acquired sei operation 
a substantial portion of the revenues in this business segment comes from contracts with the dod 
these contracts are subject to increases and decreases as well as to periodic changes in government funding provisions 
additional replacement or follow on contracts may not be available or awarded to the company 
the level of future dod expenditures in the company s research and development areas and the related impact on funding for the company s contracts are therefore not predictable  and previously reported results are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected in the future 
the company is expanding into more commercial markets  thereby contributing to offset any potential effects of any future decreases in governmental funding 
industrial computers and subsystems 
in fiscal year  industrial computers and subsystems sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year domestic sales in this segment are made principally to oem customers and are primarily derived from the shipment of industrial computers and subsystems that are designed in to the oems products 
over the last two fiscal years  the company has strengthened its international presence through the acquisition of industrial computer businesses in the united kingdom and germany and through the inception of operations in france 
these european businesses focus on lower priced standard products  with an emphasis on catalog sales 
the increase in sales in fiscal year is primarily attributable to the increase in european sales  as well as new design in wins for the customized oem products  including supply contracts of approximately million over two years under two siemens electrocom lp programs for the united states postal service 
partially offsetting these increases was the completion in the second quarter of fiscal year of sales to a single  long standing oem customer under a multi year program and the curtailment at the end of fiscal year of the company s program with digital equipment corporation due to its acquisition by compaq computers 
while standard product sales have accelerated  and the company continues to expand its presence in europe  sales under large oem programs remain a critical element of this business 
as a current marketing strategy  the company has issued product catalogs featuring both the standard and custom product lines with the dual aim of generating direct sales  as well as leads for additional oem design in opportunities 
if sales of oem products do not achieve the levels projected by the oem  or if oem projects are curtailed due to consolidations or other market conditions  such as the impact of economic conditions in asia which have substantially slowed shipments under certain programs  the company may be unable to offset such loss of sales 
in fiscal year  industrial computers and subsystems sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year sales growth in this business segment was principally derived from the expansion of its standard product offerings and marketing capabilities with the acquisition of a united kingdom based company 
although the company completed a major multi year program with a long standing customer during the first half of fiscal year  other new oem design in projects  as well as the expansion into more standard products  more than offset the impact of the major program completed  resulting in the sales growth for the year 
power conversion products 
in fiscal year  power conversion products sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of power protection and delivery systems  a business area acquired by the company in the third quarter of fiscal year in addition  sales in the company s glass to metal seal and emi filter capacitor businesses also contributed to the sales increase in this business segment 
as described above  during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired a small manufacturer of ceramic capacitors used in a variety of high voltage applications  including commercial space  defense and medical equipment 
this business has been combined with a ceramic filter business of the company  which makes similar ceramic products for different markets  and which has a growing business in filters for implantable medical devices 
the combination of these complementary product lines will provide improved efficiencies and economies of scale in the company s carson city  nevada facility 
sales of traditional high voltage capacitors increased over fiscal year  primarily due to a large multi year order under a national laboratory program that is expected to be completed in mid fiscal year offsetting this increase was the completion in the first quarter of fiscal year of an month contract for switches for the same national laboratory program 
this contract was in full production during fiscal year this segment also experienced a reduction in funded research in the powercache tm ultracapacitor business area  which was partially offset by a non recurring fee received under a technology and product rights license with siemens matsushita components gmbh 
in fiscal year  power conversion products sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year nearly all product areas contributed to the sales growth 
specifically  the ultracapacitor business area entered into new strategic partnering arrangements  including marketing and technology access rights with epcos ag formerly siemens matshusita components and pacificorp 
the company also experienced sales growth in emi filters for implantable medical products and aerospace applications 
the company s power conditioning and delivery systems and its glass to metal seal product line  both of which were acquired during fiscal year  also contributed to fiscal year sales growth  as did the aforementioned switch component contract with a national laboratory 
sterilization and purification systems 
in fiscal year  sterilization and purification systems sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year fiscal year revenues consisted primarily of fees under license agreements with key partners in several strategic business areas 
the license agreements included a grant to two sanyo entities of certain non exclusive rights for manufacturing and distribution of this segment s products  an exclusive license agreement with johnson johnson vision products  inc for the integration of purebright pulsed light sterilization systems into the manufacturing process for contact lenses  including a one time license fee  on going royalties and an equipment supply arrangement  and an amendment of an existing license with a long standing partner which narrowed the field of exclusivity and eliminated certain minimum purchase requirements  in exchange for a one time payment 
in fiscal year  sterilization and purification systems sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year gross profit in fiscal year  the company s gross profit increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  gross profit increased million  or to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit remained constant at in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year however  in fiscal year this percentage decreased slightly to from in fiscal year the increase in the dollar amount of gross profit was noted in most of the company s business segments  with the space and technology products and programs segment experiencing the largest increase in fiscal year  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales  which was primarily related to the increases in higher margin software sales and commercial space related applications previously discussed 
the company s other business segments  in particular  power conversion products  experienced significant decreases in gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal year  primarily the result of increasing price pressures and changes in sales mix 
space and technology products and programs 
in fiscal year  space and technology products and programs gross profit increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the primary factors in the increase in gross profit in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  include a higher portion of higher margin software sales  including the aforementioned large sales to defense oriented companies and the source code license fees received this fiscal year  and the inclusion of sei  which had improved gross margins in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year further  the current fiscal year includes full year revenues from physics international  which was acquired in april future gross profit margins may not be maintained at the level reached in the current year in light of the significant contribution of software license sales  which may not recur in a comparable amount 
however  the commercial space business of sei and the software product lines have the potential  if their respective growth and business objectives are achieved  to produce higher gross profit margins as a percent of sales than the traditional government focused programs of this segment 
there can  however  be no assurance that such higher margins will be achieved 
in fiscal year  space and technology programs and systems gross profit was million  down from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit  both as a dollar amount and as a percentage of sales  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to low margins received on a large space technology program at sei 
partially offsetting the low sei margins  were gross margin increases primarily due to the addition of physics international  as previously described  as well as a commercial pulsed power systems contract won during fiscal year this contract was substantially complete as of the end of fiscal year industrial computers and subsystems 
in fiscal year  industrial computers and subsystems gross profit increased million  or  to million from million fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a change in sales mix which  in fiscal year  included certain higher margin products for an oem that were near the end of their life cycle  with no such sales in the current year 
in addition  the company now has lower priced standard products  particularly in europe  as well as contracts which include full systems with greater third party content  upon which lower gross profit margins are realized 
the company won several major contracts with large oems during fiscal year  including the aforementioned siemens electrocom programs  and believes it will continue to win oem projects and that its distribution of catalogs with new lower priced standard products will provide access to a larger number of oem opportunities 
the competition for such oem programs  however  is beginning to include more foreign competitors  including asian companies 
in addition  consolidations and other market trends  such as the economic situation in asia  can adversely impact projected volumes under contracts previously awarded  as happened in fiscal year when compaq computer s acquisition of digital equipment corporation curtailed a company project 
further  compactpci products are continuing to gain favor in the marketplace 
while the company believes its own line of compactpci products is well positioned to gain market share in this product area  the impact of these factors on the company s business is not yet predictable 
as a result of the above factors  the company does not expect future gross profit margins as a percent of sales to increase significantly over those achieved in the current fiscal year 
in fiscal year  industrial computers and subsystems gross profit increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased sales during the first half of fiscal year of certain higher margin customized oem products to a long standing customer under a program that was completed during the second quarter of that year 
as a result of the completion of this program  as well as the company s entry into the lower price standard product arena  gross profit margins were higher in the first half of fiscal year than in the second half in this business area 
power conversion products 
in fiscal year  power conversion products gross profit decreased million to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects decreased development funding and technology license fees in the powercache ultracapacitor business  and a lower margin mix of products and services  particularly in the power protection and delivery systems business area 
this decrease also reflects significant changes in the company s pricing strategies in response to competitive pressures  as it continues to improve penetration in its various markets 
in addition  as the company introduces its powercache ultracapacitor products  it is pursuing aggressive pricing to gain market penetration 
as ultracapacitor product sales ramp up  gross margins will continue to be impacted until the company reaches full production volumes 
in addition  the company is working on programs to reduce the cost of materials and automate manufacturing in an effort to reduce its production costs 
further  the completion of a high margin long term contract for switch components for a national laboratory pulsed power system contributed to the gross margin decline 
in fiscal year  gross profit increased million to million from million in fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in fiscal year this increase in gross profit reflects an increase in sales volume as well as a higher margin mix of products and services from fiscal year  including the contract for switch components for the national laboratory referred to above and increased funded development and related technology access rights associated with strategic partnering arrangements 
sterilization and purification systems 
in fiscal year  sterilization and purification systems gross profit increased million to million from million fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year in fiscal year  gross profit increased to million and from million and in sales in fiscal year the increase in gross profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales  reflects the increased revenues from high margin license activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the company substantially completed a multi year  low margin research program with the us army 
the revenues from this program were replaced in fiscal year and fiscal year with higher margin commercial licensing and developmental programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of total sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in the dollar amount of these expenses is primarily in support of the company s strong sales growth  including the businesses acquired in fiscal years and in addition  the company has made substantial investments related to infrastructure  administrative and sales support 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the current year reflects  in part  the company s consolidation of the businesses acquired in and  efforts initiated in the current year to reduce general and administrative expenses  and the fact that certain general and administrative expenses do not increase in direct proportion to sales growth 
research and development expenses the company s research and development expenses reflect only internally funded research and development programs 
costs associated with united states government and other customer funded research and development contracts are included in cost of sales 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the level of research and development expenses reflects the company s ability to obtain customer funding to support a significant portion of its research and product development activities 
the increase in the amount of internally funded research and development in fiscal year over the level expended in fiscal year  reflects the company s focus on new commercial product areas  and is primarily due to development efforts on new products at sei in order to continue the growth of the commercial satellite market for the company  as well as continuing efforts on development projects in the company s other operations 
the increase in the amount of internally funded research and development in fiscal year over the level expended in fiscal year was primarily due to expenditures related to ultracapacitor  other power conversion products and power electronics systems development  and compactpci and other product development for major new programs in the industrial computers and subsystems business segment 
restructuring  acquisition and other charges during fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring  acquisition and other charges of approximately million 
of these charges  approximately million consisted primarily of direct acquisition costs for business combinations accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a charge of million  of which approximately million relates to revised estimates of final costs necessary to complete certain criminal justice information system contracts and complete the discontinuation of the related business segment that was discontinued in the third quarter of fiscal year the charge includes costs to complete and terminate such contracts  as well as other business shutdown costs  including employee related costs 
the remaining million of the charge consists primarily of amounts provided for revised estimates of costs to resolve certain environmental and legal contingencies which occurred in prior years  as well as other restructuring provisions  including employee and facility expenses  related to decisions made in july to reduce certain administrative infrastructure of the company in europe and the united states 
in fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring  acquisition and other charges totaling million 
approximately million of the charge is acquisition related  and included a million write off of acquired in process research and development and direct acquisition costs of approximately million for business combinations accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
the remaining million charge relates to the restructuring and discontinuance of a business segment and the aforementioned criminal justice information system contracts 
interest expense interest expense was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in each of last two years is the result of higher average borrowing over the preceding year  due primarily to an increase in debt assumed by the company from the various businesses acquired in and at july   the company has million outstanding under its bank line of credit  which was borrowed to pay off certain acquired debt with a higher borrowing rate 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased to  in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in interest income reflects lower average cash balances in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company received proceeds of approximately million from a follow on offering of its common stock 
such cash proceeds have been substantially used by the company to fund growth in operations and acquisitions during fiscal years and prior to the follow on offering  interest income was not significant  in fiscal year provision credit for income taxes the fiscal year credit for income taxes includes a credit of million  representing the reversal of a valuation allowance provided in previous years against certain deferred tax benefits 
the valuation allowance was reversed based on the company s determination that it has become more likely than not that such deferred tax benefits will be realized in the future 
the deferred income tax credit was partially offset by approximately  of certain foreign and state income tax expense 
in future years  the company will provide income taxes approximating applicable statutory rates  although cash payments for taxes will be substantially lower in the near term as remaining tax loss carry forwards are utilized 
the company s fiscal year and provisions for income taxes relate primarily to taxes of the businesses acquired in fiscal year using the pooling of interests method 
minority interest in net income of subsidiaries minority interest in net income of subsidiaries increased in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year reflects an increase in the profitability in fiscal year of the company s minority owned subsidiaries  primarily in the sterilization and purification systems segment and the business software product line of the space and technology products and programs segment 
net income loss as a result of the factors mentioned above  net income was million in fiscal year as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year and net income of million for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company has historically relied on a combination of internally generated funds and bank borrowings to finance its working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
in addition  in each of the two most recent fiscal years  the company received approximately million from the exercise of stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans 
in fiscal year  the company completed a follow on public offering of million shares of its common stock  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
a portion of the proceeds was used to repay outstanding bank loans and approximately million of cash was used in fiscal year for acquisitions 
the remaining proceeds were used in fiscal years and to fund growth  including additional working capital requirements 
cash used in operations in fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventory  due both to acquired businesses and in support of increased fiscal year sales 
in fiscal year  cash of million was provided by operating activities 
the company s capital expenditures in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively  and related primarily to production and other capital assets needed to support growth in all of the company s business units 
the company has ordered and continues to receive additional equipment for volume manufacturing of ultracapacitors in an existing facility  and for manufacture of emi filter capacitors at the newly expanded carson city  nevada manufacturing site 
the company will continue to address future volume or other manufacturing requirements in the upcoming year 
alternatively  the company may consider leasing facilities or manufacturing equipment or both or may satisfy high volume manufacturing requirements through outsourcing or under licensing arrangements with third parties 
if the company decides to internally finance construction of additional facilities  a significant amount of capital would be required 
the company believes that funds on hand  together with cash generated from operations and funds available under its bank line of credit  will be sufficient to finance its operations and capital expenditures through fiscal year in addition to addressing manufacturing requirements  the company may also from time to time consider acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional funding 
sources of additional funding for these purposes could include one or more of the following cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  cash flow from operations  borrowings under the existing bank line of credit  investments by strategic partners and additional debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional sources of financing on favorable terms  if at all  at such time or times as the company may require such capital 
maxwell has an unsecured bank line of credit of million  under which the company had borrowings outstanding of approximately million as of july   which were repaid in october the interest rate on the line of credit is tied to libor or the bank s prime rate 
inflation and changes in prices generally  the company has been able to increase prices to offset its inflation related increased costs in its commercial businesses 
a substantial portion of the company s business with agencies of the united states government consists of cost reimbursement contracts  which permit recovery of inflation costs 
fixed price contracts with government and other customers typically include estimated costs for inflation in the contract price 
software compatibility with year date processing the year issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
computer systems utilizing such programs may be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
this issue is often referred to as yk or a yk issue or problem 
in fiscal year  the company commenced a three phase program to ensure yk information systems compliance 
phase is to identify and remedy yk issues in the company s significant information systems infrastructure and enterprise business applications  including telecommunications and networking systems  manufacturing production and delivery systems  as well as accounting and manufacturing software 
phase is to identify and plan for yk issues that are specific to the company s business units  including local software  product matters  facilities related systems and vendor and key partner concerns 
phase is the final testing of each major area of exposure to ensure compliance  and the development of contingency plans for unsolved yk deficiencies  such as key vendors failing to adequately address their yk problems 
the company has identified four major areas determined to be critical for successful yk compliance networking and telecommunications  financial and manufacturing information systems applications  products  and third party relationships 
in phase of the program  the company has completed its review of company wide and significant systems  several of which have been identified as being yk compliant due to their recent implementation or upgrade 
such installations and upgrades were unrelated to the yk concern  but rather were implemented in the ordinary course of business 
for certain accounting and manufacturing systems  upgrades were needed and all such upgrades have been installed 
identified upgrades of the system infrastructure  such as telephone and networking equipment  are also completed 
final testing and documentation under phase has been completed 
under phase  the company has completed identifying  evaluating and resolving business unit exposures 
in the third party area  the company contacted its significant third parties  primarily key vendors and customers  regarding their yk readiness and evaluated their responses 
as to products  initial findings indicated that most company products were not impacted by the potential yk problem and that most of those that were impacted appeared to be yk compliant 
for all products that were not yk compliant  the company has made upgrades available via the company s internet web site 
final testing and contingency plan development under phase was completed in october accordingly  the company believes that it has now fully completed its yk information systems compliance plan 
the company has incurred costs of approximately million to complete all three phases of its yk information systems compliance program 
such costs include approximately  related to purchases of certain computer hardware and software  which addressed the company s yk program  but would have been purchased by the company in any event in connection with the normal periodic upgrade of its systems 
in addition  such costs include company labor costs and amounts paid to external consultants and advisors 
there can be no assurance that yk compliance problems will not be revealed in the future which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the company s customers and suppliers may be affected by yk issues that may require them to expend significant resources to modify or replace their existing systems  which may result in those customers having reduced funds to purchase the company s products or those suppliers experiencing difficulties in producing or shipping key components to the company on a timely basis or at all 
such third party issues could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
