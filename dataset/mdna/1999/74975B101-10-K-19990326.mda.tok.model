the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its industry are quality of service  breadth of service offerings  reputation of the service provider  and price 
the company believes it competes effectively with respect to each of these factors 
company organization and methodologies project management 
rwd s project management process is critical to the company s ability to satisfy its clients 
the company s project management process is used throughout all phases of an engagement and includes controls and review processes designed to ensure each project is delivered in a high quality  cost effective  and timely manner 
the project manager has primary responsibility for the success of the engagement  including managing project costs and staff schedules  service quality  and the client relationship 
the project manager is supported in these efforts by the project director  a designated senior individual with extensive project management experience 
project managers are certified only after completing a rigorous one year training process that includes classroom and on the job training and an oral examination before senior management 
the project management process includes processes for identifying and assessing project risks  as well as mechanisms to help the project manager communicate project challenges to the project director and senior management before those challenges escalate

these client review meetings ensure continuous agreement on project goals and expectations  leading ultimately to client satisfaction with the results

employees also participate in internal and external training in specific technologies such as erp software systems  object oriented design  relational database design  software configuration management  software programming languages eg  visual c  visual basic  macapp  java and javascript  document management software  and the software systems of its alliance organizations 
employees are encouraged and provided with financial support to enroll in advanced training and degree programs to increase their technical and management capabilities

the company actively recruits entry level personnel at selected college campuses and maintains a web site targeted in part to potential recruits 
the company has a policy of promoting from within whenever appropriate and also actively recruits employees with in depth expertise in technical areas in which the company currently provides services or expects to provide services in the future 
from time to time  the company uses technical recruiters to fill specific staffing needs 
the company engages a limited number of technical personnel on a consulting basis when appropriate to support particular client needs 
the company s culture  its emphasis on training  and the design of its compensation structure have been developed to attract  develop  and retain qualified and motivated professionals 
the company s culture is captured and communicated through its mission  values  and guiding principles 
senior management expends significant effort in communicating these principles to new employees and to incorporating these values into the day to day operation of the company 
the company believes this effort has played a significant role in maintaining its culture and guiding the actions of its employees 
the company also strives to provide a challenging work environment and competitive employee reward system 
additionally  the company is committed to significant and broad based employee stock ownership  believing this maximizes employees dedication to the company s growth and profitability 
in addition to the co founders ownership of million shares and options  of the company s employees as of december   held options to purchase  in aggregate  million shares of the company s common stock

the company s turnover rates in and were approximately percent and percent  respectively 
the company considers its culture  morale  and employee motivation to be excellent and key components of its success to date 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of confidentiality and other contractual arrangements and trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws to protect its proprietary rights 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  alliance organizations  and clients  thereby seeking to limit distribution of confidential and proprietary information 
a substantial majority of the company s employees are not bound by confidentiality agreements once their employment has been terminated  although the company believes common law generally prohibits these employees from disclosing to third parties proprietary information of the company 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that the company will be able to detect unauthorized use of and take steps to enforce its intellectual property rights

the company may file additional copyright applications for certain software it develops in the future 
risk management the company is subject to potential claims by dissatisfied clients that the company s services did not achieve the results expected by those clients or that errors or omissions by the company s employees contributed to disruptions in the clients operations 
to mitigate this risk  rwd seeks to clearly articulate  prior to commencement of each project  both the scope of services to be provided and the solution to be achieved 
the company holds regular alignment meetings with each client while services are being provided so that any problems can be discovered and then corrected as early in the project as possible 
this procedure is intended to allow rwd to regularly ascertain and meet client expectations during all phases of each project 
in addition  in most cases  rwd s standard contract terms limit the company s liability to the amount of the fee payable to rwd under the contract 
despite these procedures  it is possible that the company may become subject to a claim from a dissatisfied client  although the company has never been subject to litigation by a client arising out of rwd s services 
the company carries comprehensive liability  property damage  and other insurance in amounts it considers either sufficient or cost effective to cover its insurable risks 
in addition  the company carries a limited amount of professional liability insurance against claims by clients related to services provided by rwd 
the company is self insured with respect to client claims in excess of the limits on its professional liability coverage

the company s principal service segments are information technology services  enterprise resource planning services  lean manufacturing consulting  and technology performance support 
the substantial majority of the company s contracts are on a time and materials basis  although many of these contracts contain initial not to exceed fees and company performance obligations

the company typically bills contracts on a monthly basis  and senior management reviews outstanding accounts receivable balances regularly to monitor client satisfaction and collections

for example  in each of the past five years  more than percent of the year s total revenue was generated by clients who had been clients in the previous year 
gross profit margins per project and professional staff utilization rates are critical to the company s financial performance 
the company manages these parameters by carefully establishing and monitoring project budgets and timetables and by closely tracking staffing requirements for projects in progress and projects that are anticipated 
the status of all projects in progress and personnel utilization are reviewed twice per month by project managers  first line supervisors  and senior management to ensure client satisfaction and to monitor performance relative to internal financial and operating expectations 
the number of professionals assigned to a project varies according to the size  complexity  duration  and demands of the project 
professional staff utilization rates vary from period to period not only because of variations in the company s volume of business but because of the timing of employee vacations  hiring and training  the amount of time spent by employees on marketing  and project terminations or postponements 
the company has strategic relationships with several companies which have become significant to rwd s success and growth in the past several years 
the company has strategic alliances or partner status with software companies and provides services to clients implementing software products of sap  as well as documentum  siebel  lotus  point  dataware  dlb  microsoft  netscape  baan  peoplesoft  and asymetrix 
rwd also has an alliance with the international consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers to jointly provide services to clients implementing sap software 
these relationships are generally terminable upon little or no notice  and an unanticipated change in the working relationship with a strategic alliance organization could materially impact the company s results 
the company has experienced some seasonality in its business  with a tendency toward higher levels of profitability and sequential growth in revenue in the first half of each year 
this trend has resulted primarily from reduced utilization due to generally higher levels of holidays and vacations taken by employees in the second half of each year 
in addition  fluctuations in quarterly revenue growth and margins are substantially dependent on many factors which are outside of the company s control including the timing of new contract awards  the timing of individual project start ups  and the level of activity on on going projects 
client engagements are generally terminable with little or no notice or penalty  and a client s unanticipated decision to terminate or postpone a project may result in revenue fluctuations as well as higher than expected unassigned company professionals or severance expenses 
the principal components of cost of services are compensation and benefits to the company s professional staff 
cost of services also includes training and travel expenses for the company s professional staff  fees paid to subcontractors  facilities costs  and depreciation of capital equipment provided to the professional staff 
the company makes limited use of dedicated sales professionals  and time devoted by professional personnel to marketing is included in cost of services  as are costs associated with administrative personnel that directly support the company s professional staff

for example  solutions delivered outside of the information technology segment  such as in erp  frequently have significant information technology components  such as electronic information delivery  web based documentation  on line help and knowledge management systems  packaged software implementation and configuration  and electronic performance support

outlook and risks outlook 
management believes that rwd s outlook for revenue and income growth in is positive 
the principal reasons for management s positive outlook are 
strong relationships with strategic alliance organizations 

recent strong growth in new clients 

expansion of the opportunity in europe through active marketing of the company s services 

development of targeted services and marketing focus for specific vertical markets through the company s industry centers of excellence icoes 

opportunity for accelerating growth in it services and strong  but moderating growth in erp services 

emerging market demand for lean manufacturing services 
risks 
certain statements contained herein  including statements regarding development of the company s services  markets  and future demand for the company s services  and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
such forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  consequently  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied thereby 
the following are some of the factors that could cause the company s actual future results of operations to differ materially from management s expectations and historic trends 
strategic alliances 
rwd relies heavily on strategic alliances and working relationships with other companies for joint marketing  client referrals and references  as well as direct contract work 
the company s relationships with allies  particularly sap and pricewaterhousecoopers  as well as documentum  siebel  lotus  point  dataware  dlb  microsoft  netscape  baan  peoplesoft  and asymetrix have been  or are anticipated to be  important sources of revenue 
the company also faces potential competition from software companies  including its alliance organizations who  through their client services groups  may choose to compete with rwd 
most of these relationships are informal or terminable by either party with minimal notice 
the termination of  or adverse change in  any of these alliances or relationships  particularly sap and pricewaterhousecoopers  could impact the company s ability to achieve its revenue and profitability goals 

geographic expansion 
during the second half of  the company expanded its operations and marketing efforts in europe and the united kingdom  including establishing offices and expatriating employees  thereby incurring significant operating costs 
if these efforts fail to produce revenue at expected levels or within the timeframe predicted by management  operating margins in would be adversely impacted 
also  international operations present a number of risks  such as adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  cultural differences and possible changes in taxes  laws  and policies governing the operations of foreign based companies 
the company has no control over these factors  any of which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and demand for its services abroad 

enterprise resource planning industry 
during the past several years  a substantial portion of the company s revenue growth has come from services provided to clients implementing erp software systems developed by sap and others 
during  sales of erp software by the major software vendors began to slow  and industry observers are predicting a further reduction in demand for erp implementation services in as a result  rwd expects that in its erp service sector will not experience the unusually high growth it experienced in and that results for erp services will be more difficult to forecast 

rapidly changing information technology sector 
the information technology industry is subject to significant and rapid changes in technology and the demand for particular products and services 
recent examples include the shift in demand away from custom software development in favor of packaged software  the current slowdown in demand for erp software described above  as well as the difficult to predict impact on information technology services of resolving the year compliance problem 
if rwd fails to identify shifting demand in the information technology sector or does not develop the expertise necessary to provide services for which there is new demand  the company s revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

customer and industry revenue concentration 
the company derives a substantial amount of its revenue from a limited number of key clients 
in  rwd s top clients represented percent of the company s total revenue  with clients in the automotive industry generating percent of total revenue 
most of the company s engagements have no minimum purchase requirements and may be terminated by the client with little or no notice to the company 
many of these clients operate in cyclical industries  such as petrochemicals and automobiles  which are subject to economic factors that affect the clients revenue and profitability 
if any of the company s major clients discontinue doing business with the company or reduce the amount of services they purchase from the company  the company s revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

attracting and retaining personnel 
the company s growth will continue to depend on its ability to attract  develop  and retain a sufficient number of skilled professional employees 
technically qualified personnel are in short supply  and there is intense competition for qualified people 
also  the company will need to assure that its technical personnel keep current on rapid changes in technology 
in addition  the company s operating costs may be higher than management expects if competition for qualified people increases 

increasing competition 
in recent years  the company has experienced heightened competition  particularly in the erp and it segments of its business 
if competition continues to intensify  the company may find it more difficult to grow its revenue at rates comparable to historic growth rates and to maintain its profit margins at historic levels 

other factors that could significantly impact the company s results include those outlined in the company s prospectus for its initial public offering in june these factors include the company s ability to effectively manage its growth  the inherent variability of its operating results  various risks associated with the success and profitability of individual projects  and its dependence on key personnel 
year compliance the company commenced a process to ensure year compliance of all hardware  software  and ancillary equipment that are date dependent 
the process consists of four phases phase i inventory and data collection 
this phase involves an identification of all systems that are date dependent 
this phase was completed during phase ii compliance requests 
this phase involves requests to systems vendors for verification that the systems identified in phase i are year compliant 
the company has identified and has begun to replace critical systems that cannot be updated or certified as compliant 
the company commenced this phase in the first quarter of and expects to substantially complete this phase by the end of the first quarter of to date  the company has verified that its accounting  payroll  human resources  banking  and local wide area network hardware and software systems are substantially compliant 
in addition  the company has determined that substantially all of its personal computers and pc applications are compliant 
the company is currently reviewing its security systems and other miscellaneous systems 
phase iii test  fix  and verify 
this phase involves testing all systems that are date dependent and upgrading all non compliant systems 
the company expects to complete this phase during the first and second quarters of phase iv final testing  new item compliance 
this phase involves a review of all systems for compliance and re testing as necessary 
during this phase  all new systems and equipment will be tested for compliance 
the company expects to complete this phase by the end of the second quarter of to date  the company has no knowledge that any of its major systems are not year compliant or will not be compliant by the end of the second quarter of the company has not incurred significant expenditures and should achieve substantial year compliance without the need to acquire significant new hardware  software  or systems other than in the ordinary course of business 
the company is not aware of any non compliance that would have a material effect on its operations if not replaced or that would be costly to replace 
the company is not aware of any non compliance by its suppliers that is likely to have material impact on the company s business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that unanticipated non compliance will not occur  that such non compliance would not require material costs to repair or that it would not cause material disruptions if not repaired 
the company delivers software solutions to clients and believes that all such software delivered over the past several years is year compliant 
because such software is usually the property of the client  the company has no control over modifications to the software by the client or over its integration with other software  either of which could potentially cause year compliance difficulties
