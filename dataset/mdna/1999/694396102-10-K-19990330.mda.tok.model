this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare tenant invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
company s state of readiness the company s year project is divided into four general exposures computer hardware  applications software  operating equipment with embedded chips or software oe and third party suppliers and customers 
the phases common to all sections are compiling potential year sensitive items  assigning priorities to identified items  assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material to the company  repairing or replacing material items that are determined not to be year compliant  and testing material items 
computer hardware consists of personal computers pcs currently being utilized by the company 
this includes pcs utilized by employees along with pcs designated as file servers located at the corporate office

risks of the company s year issues management of the company believes it has a program in place to adequately resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year project 
the company s ability to complete the year modifications prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems is based on numerous assumptions of future events and is dependent upon numerous factors  including the ability of third party software vendors to make necessary modifications to current versions of their products  the availability of resources to install and test the modified systems and other factors 
a year failure by one or more of the financial institutions or utility companies with which the company does business could cause the company to lose access to its funds or could restrict the company s ability to borrow or operate its property

revenue producing expenditures are improvements which significantly increase the revenue producing capability of the asset including tenant improvements at industrial properties  installation of washers and dryers at multifamily properties  and other value added additions 
rehabilitation expenditures are costs the company determines are necessary during the due diligence phase immediately preceding the acquisition of a property 
at newly acquired properties  the company often finds it necessary to upgrade the physical appearance of such properties and to complete the maintenance and repair work that had been deferred by prior owners 
restorations are nonrevenue producing capital expenditures which recur on a regular basis  and have estimated useful lives of more than one year 
make ready costs incurred after a property s rehabilitation  such as carpet and appliance replacement  interior painting and window coverings are expensed as incurred 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures incurred by the company related to its operating properties for the years ended december  and all amounts are in thousands industrial development acquisitions   revenue producing   rehabilitation   restorations   multifamily development  acquisitions  revenue producing rehabilitation   restorations the company expects such expenditures will be funded from available cash balances  revolving lines of credit  equity offerings  and proceeds from refinancing 
economic conditions substantially all of the company s leases on its industrial properties  which have terms generally ranging from one to five years  contain provisions providing for rental increases based either on fixed increases or on increases in the consumer price index 
all of the company s leases on its multifamily properties are for a period of one year or less 
substantially all of the company s leases allow at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder 
accordingly  management believes the provisions contained in its industrial leases and the nature of its multifamily leases tend to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation
