the maximum amount available for borrowings under the line of credit with congress was million as of january   of which million was outstanding as of that date 
as described below  such outstanding borrowings were reduced by million on march  by proceeds from the issuance of a new certificate under the company s receivables securitization program 
receivables securitization program 
the company s receivables securitization program provides the company with an additional source of working capital and long term financing that is generally more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
as of january   the company had three outstanding series of certificates issued through private placements under the program  including million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificates the series  a million principal amount fixed base certificate the series and a variable base certificate in the principal amount of up to million the variable series

subject to certain conditions  the company may expand the securitization program to meet future receivables growth 
other financings 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has other long term obligations with total outstanding balances of million at january  million as of january  
the loans mature at dates ranging from to  bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and are collateralized by various properties and equipment of the company 
the scheduled annual principal maturities on the company s various long term obligations are million  million  million  million and million for fiscal through fiscal  with million due thereafter 
the company s revolving line of credit agreement  and certain of its long term debt and lease arrangements contain various restrictive covenants 
the company was in compliance with all such restrictive covenants as of january  the company has entered into an agreement to open one new department store in the second half of fiscal and is in the process of remodeling certain existing store locations 
the estimated cost of such projects  totaling million  is expected to be provided for from existing financial resources 
such projects are expected to be fully complete in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that the completion of such projects will not be delayed subject to a variety of conditions precedent or other factors 
management believes the previously described sources of liquidity are adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal management also believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity for its long term growth plans at moderate levels 
the company may engage in other financing activities if they are deemed to be advantageous 
year readiness the year problem is pervasive  with almost every business  large and small  affected 
the year problem impacts both information technology it  including hardware mainframes  client server systems and personal computers and software packaged software and custom designed  and impacts non information technology non it  including building security  climate control and telephone systems 
the company also exchanges data with certain trade suppliers and other third parties 
like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risks and uncertainties for the company 
if internal systems do not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
to address year issues  the company established a task force in fiscal to coordinate the identification  evaluation and implementation of changes to computer systems and applications necessary to achieve a year date conversion with no disruption to business operations 
plans and progress against plans are reviewed by the year task force and are reported to the company s senior executive officers and the board of directors on a regular basis 
it is expected that activities related to the year issues will be continue through mid fiscal with the goal of appropriately resolving all material internal systems and third party issues 
the company s state of readiness 
as of january   the company s efforts towards becoming year compliant with respect to its it systems are progressing on schedule with a projected completion date of mid fiscal based on testing to date  management believes its mainframe operating system environment and point of sale systems are already year compliant 
modifications to the company s proprietary  or custom designed software  have been substantially completed and tested 
upgrades have been scheduled for certain purchased software packages and are expected to be complete by mid fiscal the company s operating system contains a testing environment specifically designed to test year compliance 
it systems acquired from harris are limited to point of sale equipment  which has already been converted to gottschalks technology and is year compliant 
the company has also completed the identification and evaluation of all of its non it systems  which include  among other things  store alarm and security systems  air conditioners and lighting  fire control  elevators and escalators 
the company has already communicated with its suppliers  dealers  financial institutions and other third parties with which it does business to determine that the supplier s operations and the products or services they provide are year compliant or to monitor their progress toward year compliance 
some providers are not yet year compliant and the company is monitoring their progress on a continual basis 
costs associated with year issues 
the costs incurred to date related to the it year conversion are approximately  the company currently expects that the total remaining cost of these efforts  including both incremental spending and re deployed resources  will be approximately  such costs  which represent approximately of the company s fiscal it budget  consist primarily of internal personnel costs  external consulting fees and costs in excess of normal hardware and software upgrades and replacements and do not include potential costs related to the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
management expects such costs will be funded with working capital 
purchased hardware and software are being capitalized in accordance with normal policy 
personnel and all other costs related to the year project are being expensed as incurred 
in some instances  the installation schedule of new software and hardware in the normal course of business has been accelerated  or deferred  in order to resolve year compatibility issues 
the acceleration  or delay of such projects  however  will not have a materiel adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the cost of the project and the estimated completion dates for the year conversion are based on the company s best estimates  which have been derived based on a number of assumptions of future events including the continued availability of internal and external resources  the timely completion of third party modifications and other factors 
the ultimate cost of the project is subject to change as the project progresses 
actual results may differ from original estimates 
the company has not yet completed its assessment of costs that may be associated with non it year issues  as such determination will be dependant upon the results of communications with the related suppliers 
contingency plans 
management believes its efforts towards year compliance will be completed on schedule in mid fiscal in the event the company is not able to progress according to schedule  however  the company has developed contingency plans 
the company s year conversion schedule contains trigger dates to implement the contingency plan specifically designed for each system in the event the conversion has not progressed accordingly to schedule 
if necessary  the company has the ability to divert additional internal it staff onto the year project 
the company also has additional sources of contract programming specialists who are familiar with the company s operating environment 
the company also believes that it has alternate sources of suppliers for substantially all of its non it systems to replace suppliers that are unable to become year compliant within an appropriate time frame 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or its results of operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters and no assurance can be given 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor to the company s operations during the past several years  the company does experience increases in the cost of certain of its merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company accounts for its merchandise inventories on the retail method using last in  first out lifo cost using the department store price indexes published by the bureau of labor statistics 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation on reported income due to increasing costs 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating results realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
quarter ended may august october january net sales     gross profit     income loss before income tax expense benefit    net income loss    net income loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding     quarter ended may august november january net sales     gross profit     income loss before income tax expense benefit    net income loss   net income loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding     the increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during fiscal is due to the issuance of  shares of common stock to harris on august  in connection with a business acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards aicpa statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities was recently issued and is effective for fiscal this statement requires start up costs  such as new store pre opening costs  to be expensed as incurred 
sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use was also issued and is effective for fiscal sop requires certain internal and external software development costs to be capitalized upon meeting certain criteria 
the company does not expect the adoption of these new accounting standards will have a material effect on its financial position or the results of its operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business  due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
as of january   line of credit borrowings subject to a variable interest rate represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings both on and off balance sheet 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is based on a variable interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing line of credit borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of january   less a scheduled interest rate reduction of basis points on march  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately  this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements
