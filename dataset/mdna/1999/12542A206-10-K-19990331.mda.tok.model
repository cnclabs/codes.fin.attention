overview chs distributes microcomputer products  including personal computers  peripherals  networking products and software in countries  primarily in western europe  eastern europe and latin america 
the company has pursued and expects to continue to pursue a strategy of growth through acquisitions of distributors in these and other regions but at a slower pace than in prior years 
together with growth in its existing business  such acquisitions have enabled the company to significantly increase net sales and achieve strong operating results 
from to  the company s net sales increased from million to billion 
the company attributes these increases in sales to its acquisitions  increased consumer demand for the company s products and an expansion of the range of products offered 
the company derives all of its operating income and cash flow from its operating subsidiaries  most of which are organized and operated outside the united states 
generally  the company purchases its inventory with a combination of united states dollars and local currency and sells in local currency 
the company seeks to limit its exposure to the risk of currency fluctuations through hedging

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of earnings years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense earnings before income taxes income taxes minority interest net earnings compared to net sales 
net sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
of the increase in net sales  newly acquired subsidiaries contributed billion 
net sales of subsidiaries consolidated for both and grew million or 
this growth is attributed to increased consumer demand for microcomputer products offered by the company 
the growth is slower than the prior year due principally to economic difficulties in latin america and russia 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
gross profit on a comparable basis for subsidiaries consolidated for both and increased million  or 
newly acquired subsidiaries contributed million of increased gross profit 
gross margin was in and in the decrease in gross margin was caused by increased competitive pressure in all markets and the inclusion of a full year of the karma operation  which has a lower gross margin than the remainder of the company due to the nature of the products sold 
the company believes that gross margins in its distribution to reseller business may be lower due to competitive pressure 
the company is attempting to offset the decrease through expansion of its enterprise system distribution operations and distribution of private label products 
although the company has been achieving higher gross margins in and in in its eastern european operations than in other areas  the company expects gross margins in eastern europe to continue to decline due to increased competition and a company strategy to increase sales through more competitive pricing 
the company expects that the impact on gross profit due to decreased gross margins in this geographic area will be partially offset by increased sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined from in to in the company attributes this decrease to i synergies realized from combining operating entities  ii benefits of economies of scale and iii the inclusion of the results of karma in for a whole year based on lower operating expenses of karma as a percentage of its sales 
this factor is partially offset by increased goodwill amortization in  which was million during compared to million during operating expenses for both periods include the results of foreign currency transactions 
such results were a net gain of million in and million in net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is directly related to interest on the company s senior notes due and increased borrowings of the company to support increased sales 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and minority interest in subsidiaries increased from in to in the change is due to a higher proportion of income earned in jurisdictions with higher tax rates  by losses in subsidiaries with no tax benefit and increased non deductible goodwill amortization 
the company expects to have an effective tax rate lower than the statutory united states tax rate in principally due to the proportion of income expected in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and also its ability to use remaining net operating loss carryforwards from certain subsidiaries 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
of the increase in net sales  newly acquired subsidiaries including existing chs companies for the first nine months of which were integrated with companies acquired from merisel contributed billion 
net comparable sales of subsidiaries consolidated for both and grew million or 
this growth is attributed to increased consumer demand for microcomputer products offered by the company 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
gross profit on a comparable basis for subsidiaries consolidated for both and increased million  or 
newly acquired subsidiaries including existing chs companies for the first nine months of which were integrated with companies acquired from merisel contributed million of increased gross profit 
for purposes of determining the increase in gross profit  the company allocated manufacturers rebates to its more significant subsidiaries 
gross margin increased from in to in the change in gross margin was due to increased early payment discounts and vendor rebates offset to some extent by lower gross margins of the recently acquired karma operations 
the company utilized more early payment discount opportunities as a result of the cash generated by its public equity offering in july additionally  the company s growth has resulted in more favorable volume rebates with certain key vendors 
the increase in gross margin attributable to early payment discounts and volume rebates was offset by the fact that the karma operation has a lower gross margin due to the nature of the products sold 
the company expects that gross margins will be lower than in due to the impact of having the karma operations included in the entire year and due to continued competitive pressures 
although the company has been achieving higher gross margins and in and  respectively in its eastern european operations than in other areas  the company expects gross margins in eastern europe to continue to decline due to increased competition and a company strategy to increase sales through more competitive pricing 
the company expects that the impact on gross profit due to decreased gross margins in this geographic area will be fully offset by increased sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined from in to in included were the expenses of maintaining a minimally utilized warehouse in the netherlands in and million in merisel restructuring expenses in in  such warehouse is expected to be utilized for distribution of universal products such as mass storage and components 
the comparative operating expense ratios without these items would have been for and for the company expects that the inclusion of karma s results for a full year will result in operating expenses being a lower percentage of net sales based on the lower operating expenses of karma 
operating expenses for both periods include the results of foreign currency transactions 
such results were a net gain of million in and million in net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is directly related to the increase in average loan amounts outstanding 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and minority interest in subsidiaries decreased from in to in the change is due to a higher proportion of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the use of net operating loss carryforwards  offset  to a certain extent  by losses in subsidiaries with no tax benefit and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the company expects to have an effective tax rate lower than the statutory united states tax rate in principally due to its ability to use remaining net operating loss carryforwards from certain subsidiaries and the proportion of income expected in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
seasonality the company typically experiences variability in its net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors  including the condition of the microcomputer industry in general  shifts in demand for software and hardware products and industry announcements of new products or upgrades 
sales in europe in the fourth quarter of each year are typically higher than in the other quarters 
in latin america  sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year are typically higher than in the first and second quarters 
liquidity and capital resources net cash of million and million were used in operating activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  such amount was funded by increases in borrowings from banks of million and new long term debt of million 
in  such amount was funded from increases in bank borrowings and proceeds of a public offering 
in both years  cash was used principally due to increases in inventories and trade accounts receivable 
in  cash was provided by increases in accounts payables and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities in and included million and million  respectively  related to fixed asset additions 
in addition  million and million were used for acquisitions during such years respectively 
net cash of million and million was provided by financing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively  due principally to net borrowings of million and million  respectively  the issuance of the company s senior notes due during  which proceeds were used for acquisitions  and proceeds of equity public offering totaling million in on december   three of the company s german subsidiaries collectively  the borrowers entered into a three year dm million facility agreement with a bank 
advances under the agreement may be used for working capital needs of the borrowers and are based upon a borrowing base equal to the aggregate of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and of inventory of a specific vendor 
the debt is secured by a lien on the receivables  inventories and intangible assets of the borrowers and two austrian subsidiaries of the company  and a lien on the receivables of a swiss subsidiary of the company collectively  the pledgors  and a pledge of the shares of the borrowers and the pledgors 
the indebtedness has been guaranteed by the company  the pledgors  and certain other subsidiaries of the company 
the loan bears interest at per annum above deutschmark now euro libor 
the agreement  among other things  limits the ability of the borrowers to incur additional indebtedness 
the company has used this credit facility as a replacement to off balance sheet financing  which carried a higher interest cost 
as a result  the consolidated amount of trade receivables and debt has increased as of december  as compared to previous periods 
the increase in trade receivables caused the company s days sales in receivables to increase from previous periods 
the company s subsidiaries typically enter into short term credit agreements with financial institutions in their countries of operations 
at december   of the million aggregate amount available under these agreements  million was outstanding 
such agreements are usually for a term of one year and are secured by the receivables of the borrower and  in certain instances  inventories of the borrower 
the weighted average interest rate at december  was 
certain of these agreements contain financial covenants requiring  among other things  the maintenance of certain net worth and loan to collateral value terms 
the company typically guarantees these loans 
the company has also guaranteed the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries to certain vendors 
at december   the company was not in compliance with a minimum tangible net worth covenant contained in a short term credit facility 
the company has obtained a waiver from the lender 
the company derives all of its operating income and cash flow from its subsidiaries and relies on payments from  and intercompany borrowings with  its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations 
in certain countries  exchange controls may limit the ability of the company s subsidiaries to make payments to the company 
claims of creditors of the company s subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets and cash flow of such subsidiaries over the claims of the company or its shareholders 
restrictions in financing or credit arrangements may also limit access to such earnings 
certain of these revolving credit agreements limit the ability of the respective subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or provide other distributions to the company 
ebitda of all subsidiaries with such limitations amounted to and of the company s consolidated ebitda for the years ended december  and  respectively 
currently  the subsidiaries with such agreements are chs uk  santech norway  bek international  chs latin america and chs promark 
such credit agreements have maximum available amounts of million in total 
in april  the company issued million of senior notes notes due the notes bear interest of per annum and interest is payable semi annually on april and october beginning october  the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april   initially at of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  declining to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on or after april  certain of the company s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally jointly and severally guaranteed the notes on an unsecured basis 
the guarantor subsidiaries are principally non operating subsidiaries in the united states 
the notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the company s subsidiaries that are not guarantors 
the notes contain certain covenants which  among other things  will restrict the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions in respect to their capital stock  enter into certain transactions with shareholders and affiliates  make certain investments and other restricted payments  create liens  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and sell assets 
the covenants are  however  subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications 
the company s principal need for additional cash in will be i for the purchase of additional inventory to support growth  ii to take greater advantage of available cash discounts offered by certain of the company s vendors for early payment  iii to pay amounts due to sellers of businesses  and iv for the cash component of possible future acquisitions 
the company is seeking additional cash for this purpose through its existing bank credit lines and through additional credit facilities  but management can give no assurance that financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
however  at this time  the company  has sufficient funds to support its expected growth in existing operations for the remainder of on october  metro ag of germany announced that its planned sale of the vobis group to the company would not be concluded 
metro has attempted to draw under a dm million approximately million letter of credit provided to metro by the company in connection with the transaction 
the company believes that the conditions permitting metro to draw on the letter of credit were not met 
metro has also announced that it may seek damages for an unspecified amount against the company as a result of the transaction not being consummated 
the purchase agreement calls for disputes to be settled by arbitration in germany 
the purchase agreement does not provide for a break up fee 
although no prediction as to the outcome of either the attempted draw on the letter of credit or any actions which may be commenced in connection with the purchase agreement can be made at this time  the company believes that it has defenses to any potential claims of metro and intends to assert them vigorously 
as of the date of this filing  no arbitration proceedings had been commenced by metro 
year the company has completed the risk assessment phase of its year compliance efforts year project 
based on the assessment  the company has developed an action plan and identified corporate  regional and subsidiary level year project team members  charged with ensuring that the company will be compliant 
the plan principally consists of replacing or repairing non compliant systems including both information it systems and non it systems 
the initial focus of the plan is on high risk high impact areas 
the six areas covered initially are shown below  in descending order of potential high risk impact 
bullet transaction processing systems includes all internal and external interfaces bullet telephony bullet network local area networks bullet desktop computing bullet third parties suppliers  customers  financial institutions  utilities bullet other non it equipment the company s current it systems infrastructure is decentralized 
independent of the year issue  the company has been standardizing its transaction processing platforms and ultimately reducing the number of separate systems 
the company has selected a core of standard platforms jba system  oracle financials  and scala 
various tasks in the platform standardization project have been accelerated in order to resolve year issues 
state of readiness 
the tables below set forth the company s state of readiness 
compliance schedule for transaction processing systems transaction processing of gross system to be compliant sales budget already compliant first quarter second quarter third quarter other critical areas area to be compliant telephony october network october desktop computing october third parties first quarter other non it equipment second quarter costs 
the company estimates its total year costs to be million 
this is primarily the cost of replacing transaction processing systems  but also includes consulting fees and repair replacement of other software and it non it equipment 
approximately million has been spent to date 
this estimate is based on current knowledge and assumes that the company will not incur additional costs due to the actions or state of readiness of third parties 
risks 
due to its decentralized it structure  the company believes there is no single point of failure 
at this point in time  the company believes the most likely potential risks are bullet the inability of some customers of the company s smaller subsidiaries to pay on time 
bullet the temporary inability of a few of the company s more small subsidiaries  to take orders 
although every effort will be made to ensure third party issues are resolved  the company has no direct means to influence such parties 
it is therefore not possible to ensure that all such issues are resolved or to estimate the potential impact on the company 
in the case of the company s major suppliers  the company currently believes the risk is low 
contingency plans 
contingency plans for transaction processing systems are expected to be completed by first quarter contingency plans for telephony  network  and desktop computing are expected to be completed by second quarter the plans will potentially include remediation of systems scheduled to be replaced  manual procedures  emergency power sources  and the stock piling of certain equipment 
euro on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union had to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing legal currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for business transactions 
the conversion to the euro will eliminate currency exchange risk between the member countries 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions  and the legal currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company s subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and financial systems  business processes and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
since financial systems and processes currently accommodate multiple currencies  the plans contemplate conversion by mid as part of the company s year project 
the company does not expect the conversion costs to be material 
due to numerous uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the effects  if any  one common currency will have on pricing on its financial condition or results of operations 
inflation the company operates in certain countries that have experienced high rates of inflation and hyperinflation 
however  inflation did not have any meaningful impact on the company s results of operations during the year ended december  nor during the three year period ended december   and the company does not expect that it will have a material impact during asset management inventory 
the company s goal is to achieve high inventory turns and maintain a low number of skus and thereby reduce the company s working capital requirements and improve return on equity 
the company s strategy to achieve this goal is to both manage its inventory effectively and achieve high order fill rates 
to reduce the risk of loss to the company due to vendor price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory  the company s contracts with its vendors generally provide price protection and stock rotation privileges  subject to certain limitations 
price protection allows the company to offset the accounts payable owed to a particular vendor if such vendor reduces the price of products the company has purchased within a specified period of time and which remain in inventory 
stock rotation permits the company to return to the vendor for full credit  with an offsetting purchase order for new products  predetermined amounts of inventory purchased within a specified period of time 
such credit is typically used to offset existing invoices due without incurring re stocking fees 
accounts receivable 
the company manages its accounts receivable to balance the needs of its customers to purchase on credit with its desire to minimize its credit losses 
bad debt expense as a percentage of the company s net sales for each of the years ended and was 
the company s credit losses have been minimized by its extensive credit approval process and the use of credit insurance and factoring by its western european subsidiaries 
in its sales to customers in latin america  the company often receives post dated checks at the time of sale 
customers who qualify for credit are typically granted payment terms appropriate to the customs of each country 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
occasionally  the company may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counter parties are major financial institutions and therefore credit risk associated with these contracts is considered immaterial 
interest rate risk 
at december   the fair value of notes payable approximated  their carrying value due to their short term maturities 
the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
changes in interest rates will affect the market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt including current portion at december  was million 
a increase in prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  and from investment bankers using current interest rates considering credit risk and the remaining terms to maturity 
currency risk management functional currency 
the company s functional currency  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 is the united states dollar 
most of the company s subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currency and translate assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and results of operations using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation effects are reflected in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity 
the company s exposure under these translation rules  which is unhedged  may affect the carrying value of its foreign net assets and therefore its equity and net tangible book value  but not its net income or cash flow 
exchange differences arising from transactions and balances in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded as expense or income in the subsidiaries and the company and affect the statements of earnings 
hedging and currency management activities 
due to its international business presence  the company transacts extensively in foreign countries and foreign currencies 
as a result  earnings may experience some volatility related to movements in exchange rates 
the company attempts to limit its risk of currency fluctuations through hedging where possible 
in the year ended december   a significant amount of the purchases of products by the company were made in united states dollars and approximately of company sales were made in currencies other than the united states dollar 
the primary currencies in which sales were made were the german mark of sales  the french franc and the british pound 
at december   approximately million of accounts payable were attributable to foreign currency liabilities denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currencies 
of these  million were denominated in united states dollars and million were denominated in german marks 
approximately of these liabilities were unhedged 
chs finance  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  engages in central treasury functions including hedging activities related to foreign currency for the company and short term working capital loans to the company s subsidiaries to enable them to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by certain vendors 
these loans are denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary or united states dollars 
generally  chs finance hedges its receivables denominated in currencies other than its functional currency  the swiss franc 
it attempts to limit the amount of unhedged receivables to an amount which approximates the total european unhedged liabilities 
the company intends to review this policy periodically and may modify it in the future 
through both hedging activities coordinated by chs finance and subsidiary hedging activities  the company makes forward purchases of united states dollars in an attempt to hedge certain european currencies and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
additionally  in certain countries in eastern europe and in latin america where it is not practical to make forward purchases  to minimize exposure to currency devaluations  the company has adopted a policy of attempting to match levels of local denominationed accounts receivable with accounts payable and to limit holdings of local currencies 
in these countries  the company attempts to sell products at the united states dollar equivalent rate 
factors which affect exchange rates are varied and no reliable prediction methods are available for definitively determining future exchange rates 
in general  countries make an effort to maintain stability in rates for trade purposes 
there can be no assurance that these asset management programs will be effective in limiting the company s exposure to these risks 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge groups of foreign currency transactions on a continuing basis for periods consistent with its committed exposure 
the foreign exchange contracts are valued at market and generally have maturities which do not exceed three months 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are intended to offset losses and gains on assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
as a result  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect due to exchange rate movements over the short period covered by these contracts 
at december   the face value of foreign exchange forward contracts against trade payables was million  which approximated fair market value of these contracts 
holding other variables constant  if there were a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the decrease in market value of these contracts at december  would be offset by decreases in trade payables 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is currently assessing the effects of adopting sfas  and has not made a determination of the impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas will be effective for our first quarter of year
