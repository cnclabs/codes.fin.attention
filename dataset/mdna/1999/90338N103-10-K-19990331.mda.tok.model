these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
some of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will continue to provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to remain profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
in periods of high fuel prices  the company offsets the effect of price increases through fuel surcharges to customers or through rate increases in lieu of fuel surcharges 
the company also periodically hedges against future fuel price increases by purchasing defined quantities of fuel for future delivery at contracted prices 
future increases or decreases in fuel prices are uncertain 
to the extent the company is unable to offset fuel price increases through fuel surcharges  rate increases or hedges  increased fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense  and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future 
the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels  it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
if interest rates increased significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during the twelve month period ended december  were funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  proceeds from sales of used revenue equipment  and the use of long term operating leases for revenue equipment acquisitions 
on december   the company had in place a million credit facility with a group of banks with a weighted average interest rate of  of which million was available for borrowing 
the loan matures january  interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon the london interbank offered rate plus applicable margins  as defined in the credit agreement 
the note is collateralized by certain property and equipment of the company 
the company also had a million credit facility at december   all of which was available for borrowing 
in  the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  proceeds from sale of used revenue equipment and long term operating lease financing for the acquisition of revenue equipment 
cash generated from operations increased to million in fiscal from million for the transition period 
net cash used in investment activities was million in fiscal and million for the transition period 
of the cash used in investment activities in fiscal  million was used to acquire additional property and equipment  compared to million for the transition period 
additionally  the use of cash in investment activities in included million related principally to the acquisition of victory express and pst vans 
in  the company financed the acquisitions of victory express and pst vans and repaid a substantial portion of its long term debt with proceeds from the million revolving line of credit established in in  the company used cash to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
in  cash flows from financing activities included million from the sale of  shares of class a common stock 
management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit and long term operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally shows a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season and its inherent weather variations 
the company s operating expenses also have historically been higher in the winter weather 
year compliance some computer systems that use two digits to indicate a year will not be able to process data properly for the year the company has assessed the ability of its software and operating systems to function in the year and beyond 
systems in use by the company in operations  accounting and purchasing are year compliant 
a complete comprehensive test of the us xpress systems for year compliance is scheduled for july systems in use at csi crown are presently compliant with year requirements 
programming to make csi crown systems compliant is expected to be completed by june  testing of csi crown systems is scheduled for july us xpress is currently obtaining status updates and information concerning the year compliance from its suppliers and customers 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
with that in mind  us xpress is putting in place a plan to replace those vendors and or suppliers that will not be compliant 
the costs to the company in achieving year compliance have not been material and are not expected to be material in the future
