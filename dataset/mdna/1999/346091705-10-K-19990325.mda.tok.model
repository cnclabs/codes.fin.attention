regulation united states 
various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
all of the jurisdictions in which the company owns or operates producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas  including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells and maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and provisions relating to the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
the company s operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states can order the pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
some states  such as texas and oklahoma  have  in recent years  reviewed and substantially revised methods previously used to make monthly determinations of allowable rates of production from fields and individual wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of crude oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells  and to limit the number of wells or the location at which the company can drill 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  b and c order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate gas producers like the company  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
it is unclear what impact  if any  increased competition within the natural gas industry under order no 
will have on the company s activities  although recent price declines for natural gas may  in part  reflect increased competition and more efficient gas transportation resulting from order no the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
in particular  the ferc has recently begun a broad review of its transportation regulations  including how they operate in conjunction with state proposals for retail gas market restructuring  whether to eliminate cost of service rates for short term transportation  whether to allocate all short term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions  and whether changes to its long term transportation policies may also be appropriate to avoid a market bias toward short term contracts 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect the company only indirectly  these policy statements and proposed rule changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
the company cannot predict what action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can it predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve its stated goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets 
however  the company does not believe that it will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which it competes 
in order nos 
and a  the ferc established an indexing system under which oil pipelines are able to change their transportation rates  subject to prescribed ceiling levels 
the indexing system  which allows or may require pipelines to make rate changes to track changes in the producer price index for finished goods  minus one percent  became effective january  in certain circumstances  these rules permit oil pipelines to establish rates using traditional cost of service or other methods of rate making 
the company is not able at this time to predict the effects of order nos 
and a  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from the company s oil producing operations 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
to date  the ferc has not issued rules to implement the ocsla s requirements on gatherers and other non jurisdictional entities  though it has issued such rules for interstate pipelines 
one of the ferc s recently initiated inquiries involves whether it should alter its regulatory treatment of pipelines and services on the ocs 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry  or what  if any  affect it may have on the company 
certain operations the company conducts are on federal oil and gas leases  which the minerals management service mms administers 
the mms issues such leases through competitive bidding 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
lessees must also comply with detailed mms regulations governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for offshore production facilities  safety procedures  flaring of production  plugging and abandonment of ocs wells  calculation of royalty payments and the valuation of production for this purpose and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that the company can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require any company operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition and operations 
the mms has under consideration proposals to change the method of calculating royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
these changes  if adopted  would modify the valuation procedures for crude oil to reduce use of oil posted prices and assign a value to crude oil intended to better reflect market value 
the company cannot predict what action the mms will take on this matter  nor can it predict at this stage how the company might be affected if the mms adopts such changes 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress  states  the ferc and the courts 
the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company does not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
oil spill financial responsibility requirements united states 
as originally enacted  the oil pollution act of opa would have required the company to establish million in financial responsibility to cover oil spill related liabilities 
under recent amendments to the opa  the responsible person for an offshore facility located seaward of state waters  including ocs facilities  will be required to provide evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of million 
although the financial responsibility requirement for offshore facilities located landward of the seaward boundary of state waters including certain facilities in coastal inland waters is a lesser amount million  the company currently has a number of offshore facilities located beyond state waters and  thus  is subject to the million financial responsibility requirement 
on august   the mms promulgated a final rule implementing the financial responsibility requirements set forth under the opa amendments 
the amount of financial responsibility may be increased  to a maximum of million  if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at the facility may exceed the applicable threshold volumes specified under the mms final rule 
the company expects that financial responsibility could be established through insurance  guaranty  indemnity  surety bond  letter of credit  qualification as a self insurer or a combination thereof 
the company cannot predict whether these financial responsibility requirements under the opa amendments or the mms final rule will result in the imposition of significant additional annual costs to the company in the future  but in any event  the impact of the opa amendments and the mms rule is not expected to be any more burdensome to the company than it will be to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production in the gulf of mexico 
the company currently satisfies similar requirements for its ocs leases under ocsla 
canada 
the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect the operations of the company in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
all current legislation is a matter of public record and the company is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be created 
in canada  producers of oil negotiate sales contracts directly with oil purchasers  with the result that the market determines the price of oil 
the price depends in part on oil quality  prices of competing fuels  distance to market  the value of refined products  and the supply demand balance 
oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not exceeding one year in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years in the case of heavy crude  provided that an order approving any such export has been obtained from the national energy board neb 
any oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration to a maximum of years requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb and the issue of such a license requires the approval of the governor in council 
in canada  the price of natural gas sold in interprovincial and international trade is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers 
natural gas exported from canada is subject to regulation by the neb and the government of canada 
exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb and the government of canada 
as is the case with oil  natural gas exports for a term of less than two years or for a term of to years in quantities of not more than  m day must be made pursuant to an neb order  or  in the case of exports for a longer duration to a maximum of years or a larger quantity  pursuant to an export license from the neb with the governor in council s approval 
the provincial governments of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability  transportation arrangements and market considerations 
on january  the north american free trade agreement nafta among the governments of canada  the united states and mexico became effective 
nafta carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canada us free trade agreement 
in the context of energy resources  canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy resource exported relative to domestic use based upon the proportion prevailing in the most recent month period  ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price  and iii disrupt normal channels of supply 
all three countries are prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 
nafta contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of any regulatory changes and to minimize disruption of contractual arrangements  which is important for canadian natural gas exports 
in addition to federal regulation  each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure  royalties  production rates  environmental protection and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
from time to time the governments of canada  alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan have established incentive programs which have included royalty rate deductions  royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects 
in alberta  a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the royalties payable to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the artc program is based on a price sensitive formula  and the artc rate varies between  at prices for oil below cdn per cubic meter  and  at prices above cdn per cubic meter 
the artc rate is applied to a maximum of million cdn of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer or associated group of producers 
crown royalties on production from producing properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible for artc 
the rate is established quarterly based on the average par price  as determined by the alberta department of energy for the previous quarterly period 
canadian forest is eligible for artc credits only on eligible properties acquired and wells drilled after the change of control 
on december  the government of alberta gave notice that they intended to review the artc program 
any changes to the program will not take effect prior to oil and natural gas royalty holidays and reductions for specific wells reduce the amount of crown royalties paid by the company to the provincial governments 
in alberta  the artc program provides a rebate on alberta crown royalties paid in respect of eligible producing properties in alberta 
environmental matters 
extensive us federal  state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of the company 
compliance with environmental requirements generally could have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of forest and its subsidiaries 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
nevertheless  changes in environmental law have the potential to adversely affect the company s operations 
for instance  a few us courts have ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as hazardous substances under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act commonly called superfund and thus the company could become subject to the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the federal superfund program if significant concentrations of such wastes were determined to be present at the company s properties or to have been produced as a result of the company s operations 
alternately  pending amendments to superfund presently under consideration by the us congress could relax many of the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the statute 
the us oil pollution act opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility pipeline or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages from oil spills 
opa also requires operators of offshore ocs facilities to demonstrate to the minerals management service mms that they possess at least million in financial resources that are available to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
this financial responsibility amount can increase up to a maximum of million if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at a facility exceeds applicable threshold volumes established by the mms 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation 
if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup  liability limits likewise do not apply 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
the us water pollution control act commonly called the clean water act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas wastes in navigable waters 
many state discharge regulations and the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system generally prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into coastal waters 
although the costs to comply with these zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be significant  the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs in the western gulf of mexico and the company believes that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operations 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation 
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
in alberta  environmental compliance has been governed by the alberta environmental protection and enhancement act aepea since september  in addition to replacing a variety of older statutes which related to environmental matters  aepea also imposes certain new environmental responsibilities on oil and natural gas operators in alberta and in certain instances also imposes greater penalties for violations 
british columbia s environmental assessment act became effective june  this legislation rolls the previous processes for the review of major energy projects into a single environmental assessment process which contemplates public participation in the environmental review 
although the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to fully cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
the company has established guidelines to be followed to comply with us and canadian environmental laws  rules and regulations 
the company has designated a compliance officer whose responsibility is to monitor regulatory requirements and their impacts on the company and to implement appropriate compliance procedures 
the company also employs an environmental manager whose responsibilities include causing forest s operations to be carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and implementing adequate safety precautions 
although the company maintains pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
forward looking statements certain information in this form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
you can identify these statements by words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue or other similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other forward looking information 
when considering such forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k 
the information disclosed under risk factors and other factors noted throughout this form k  including certain risks and uncertainties  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely and have declined significantly recently 
numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of such data by geological engineers 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating forest 
oil and gas price declines and their volatility could adversely affect forest s revenues  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely and have declined significantly recently 
the average spot price received by forest for natural gas produced in the gulf coast decreased from approximately per mcf at december  to per mcf at december  and decreased to approximately per mcf at march  during the same period  the nymex price for crude oil decreased from per barrel at december  to per barrel at december  and was per barrel at march  natural gas prices affect forest more than oil prices  because most of its production and reserves are natural gas 
at december   of our estimated proved reserves consisted of natural gas on an mcfe basis and  during  approximately of our total production consisted of natural gas 
forest s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
we recently reduced our capital expenditures budget because of lower oil and gas prices 
the amount we can borrow from banks is subject to redetermination based on current prices 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that forest can produce economically 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices and prices may decline further 
factors that can cause this fluctuation include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of oil and gas imports  and overall economic conditions 
we enter into energy swap agreements and other financial arrangements at various times to attempt to minimize the effect of oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that such transactions will reduce risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices 
any substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
energy swap agreements may limit the risk of declines in prices  but such arrangements may also limit additional revenues from price increases 
for further information concerning prices  market conditions and energy swap agreements  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex 
this process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to in this form k is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
recent significant declines in oil and gas prices have reduced forest s present value of future net revenues 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
for example  we have reduced our capital expenditure budget 
this reduction will delay cash flows and thereby reduce present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with forest or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the discount factor 
leverage materially affects our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was million including million outstanding under our global bank credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by the chase manhattan bank and the chase manhattan bank of canada 
our long term debt represented of our total capitalization at december  our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a large portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the agreements governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default or a change of control 
in addition  we may significantly alter our capitalization in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level of debt 
a higher level of debt increases the risk that forest may default on its debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if forest is unable to repay its debt at maturity out of cash on hand  it could attempt to refinance such debt  or repay such debt with the proceeds of an equity offering 
we cannot assure you that forest will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on its debt or that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
in addition  forest s bank borrowing base is subject to semi annual redeterminations 
forest could be forced to repay a portion of its bank borrowings due to redeterminations of its borrowing base  and we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to make such repayments 
if we are not able to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or to arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions and our value and performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
lower oil and gas prices increase the risk of ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation writedown 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
in  forest recorded writedowns of million million pre tax 
the subsequent significant declines in natural gas prices increase the risk that we will have a ceiling limitation writedown in the first quarter of we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling limitation writedowns in the future 
forest s liquidity is subject to the risk of the availability of financing 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity needs through the use of bank credit facilities  the issuance of debt and equity securities and the use of cash provided by operating activities 
we continue to examine the following alternative sources of long term capital bank borrowings or the issuance of debt  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  the issuance of nonrecourse production based financing or net profits interests  sales of non strategic properties  o sales of prospects and technical information  and o joint venture financing 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  oil and natural gas prices and the value and performance of forest 
we may be unable to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources 
forest s ability to replace production with new reserves is highly dependent on acquisitions or successful development and exploration activities  which in turn are adversely affected by forest s reduced capital expenditures budget 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
gulf of mexico reservoirs experience steep declines  while the declines in long lived fields in other regions are relatively slow 
a significant portion of our production is from gulf of mexico reservoirs 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration activities 
forest s future natural gas and oil production is highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future development  acquisition and exploration activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
we have reduced our capital expenditures budget 
it is unlikely  therefore  that forest will replace production based on the lower level of capital expenditures 
forest s operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and gas drilling and production activities 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  many of which are beyond our control 
these risks include the following that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found  that oil and gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled  and that our ability to develop  produce and market our reserves may be limited by title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and mechanical difficulties or shortages or delays in the delivery of drilling rigs  work boats and other equipment 
in the past  we have had difficulty securing drilling equipment in certain of our core areas 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after drilling  operating and other costs are unprofitable 
in addition  our properties may be susceptible to hydrocarbon draining from production by other operations on adjacent properties 
our industry also experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  gas leaks  ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
additionally  a substantial portion of our oil and gas operations is located in the gulf of mexico 
the gulf of mexico area experiences tropical weather disturbances  some of which can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
forest s concentration of assets increases its exposure to production declines 
at march   the combined production from six of our offshore gulf of mexico wells represented approximately of forest s consolidated daily deliverability 
our production  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if production from these six wells decreases significantly 
the profitability of forest s gas marketing activities is subject to numerous risks  including credit risks and response to changing conditions 
our operations include gas marketing through our subsidiary  promark 
promark s gas marketing operations consist of the marketing of gas production in canada  the purchase and direct sale of third parties natural gas  the handling of transportation and operations of third party gas and spot purchasing and selling of natural gas 
the profitability of such natural gas marketing operations depends on our ability to assess and respond to changing market conditions  including credit risk 
profitability also depends on our ability to maximize the volume of third party natural gas that we purchase and resell and to obtain a satisfactory margin between the purchase price and the sales price for such volumes 
if we are unable to respond accurately to changing conditions in the gas marketing business  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  promark sells a significant portion of its volumes at fixed prices under long term contracts 
the loss of one or more such long term buyers could have a material adverse effect on forest 
promark buys and sells gas in its trading operations for terms varying from one day to two years 
profits from trading are derived from the difference between the price of gas purchased and the price of gas sold 
promark tries to limit its exposure to price risk by offsetting its gas purchase or sales commitments with other gas purchase or sales contracts 
however  promark is exposed to credit risk because the counterparties to agreements might not perform their contractual obligation 
forest s international operations are subject to the risks of currency fluctuations and in some instances economic and political developments 
we have significant operations in canada 
the expenses of such operations are payable in canadian dollars while most of the revenue from natural gas and oil sales is based upon us dollar price indices 
as a result  canadian operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative values of the canadian and us dollars 
forest is also required to recognize foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the debt issued by our canadian subsidiary because the debt is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of such subsidiary is the canadian dollar 
we recently acquired additional oil and gas assets in other countries 
our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by local political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other foreign laws or policies  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in other countries 
forest operates in a highly competitive industry which may adversely affect its operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
forest competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
forest also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
forest s operations are subject to the numerous risks of drilling 
drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that drilling efforts will not find commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often unpredictable  and drilling operations may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of risks 
these risks include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions and shortages or delays in delivery of equipment 
we cannot assure you that our future drilling activities will be successful 
forest s current inventory of seismic surveys will not necessarily increase the likelihood that it will drill or complete commercially productive wells 
in addition  the volumes of reserves discovered  if any  would not necessarily be greater than forest would have discovered without its current inventory of seismic surveys 
forest s acquisitions are subject to the risks of the uncertainties of recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due in part acquisitions of producing properties 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  the review will not permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every platform or well 
even when a platform or well is inspected  structural and environmental problems are not necessarily discovered 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
in addition  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that we will acquire such acquisitions at acceptable prices 
the marketability of forest s production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
us federal and state and canadian regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand all could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
if market factors dramatically changed  the financial impact on forest could be substantial 
the availability of markets is beyond our control 
forest s oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial governmental regulation that materially affect its operations 
matters regulated include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling and abandonment bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  the oil pollution act of requires operators of offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial responsibility to address potential oil spills 
under such law and other federal and state environmental statutes  owners and operators of certain defined facilities are strictly liable for such spills  subject to certain limitations 
a substantial spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
federal  state  provincial and local laws regulate production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and gas  by products from oil and gas and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations 
to date  our expenditures related to complying with these laws and for remediation of existing environmental contamination have not been significant 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
however  the requirements of such laws and regulations are frequently changed 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
the significant ownership position of anschutz could limit forest s ability to enter into certain transactions 
as of february   anschutz owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
pursuant to a shareholder agreement between anschutz and forest  anschutz may designate three of forest s directors 
therefore  anschutz can substantially influence matters considered by forest s board of directors 
the shareholder agreement prohibits anschutz from acquiring in excess of of the outstanding shares of common stock 
the shareholder agreement terminates on july  under certain circumstances  anschutz could veto proposed transactions between forest and third parties 
for example  anschutz could veto a merger of forest  which under applicable law requires the approval of the holders of two thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock 
control of forest most likely could not be transferred to a third party without anschutz s consent and agreement 
a third party probably would not offer to pay a premium to acquire forest without the prior agreement of anschutz  even if the board of directors should choose to attempt to sell forest in the future 
in addition  shareholder approval would be required by new york stock exchange rules for the issuance of common stock to a third party in an amount in excess of of the outstanding common stock 
anschutz s opposition to such a transaction could significantly reduce the likelihood of its approval

a net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells equals one 
the number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof 
farmout agreements under a farmout agreement  outside parties undertake exploration activities on prospects owned by forest 
this enables us to participate in the exploration prospects without incurring additional capital costs  although with a substantially reduced ownership interest in each prospect 
in  seven exploratory wells were drilled in the united states under farmout agreements 
six were productive and one was a dry hole 
in canada  two exploratory wells were drilled in under farmout agreements  both of which were productive 
present activities at december  forest and its subsidiaries had six exploratory wells and one development well that were in the process of being drilled 
of the six exploratory wells  one in the us reached total depth and is currently being evaluated 
of the five remaining exploratory wells in canada  three have been drilled and are being evaluated and the remaining two are still being drilled 
the development well in the us is still being drilled 
delivery commitments a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the promark netback pool 
at december  the promark netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell approximately bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf and approximately bcf of natural gas in at an average price of approximately cdn per mcf

the value of the canadian dollar was 
per us at december  compared to 
at december  forest is required to recognize the noncash foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the notes because the debt is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of canadian forest is the canadian dollar 
the extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt in resulted from settlement of forest s remaining nonrecourse production payment obligation in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock valued at  the obligation had a remaining book value of approximately  when it was settled and we recorded an extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt of  after related expenses

liquidity and capital resources forest has historically addressed its long term liquidity needs through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit  and through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities 
in   and early  we completed several transactions that improved our financial position 
in january forest and saxon sold  shares of common stock for per share in a public offering 
of this amount   shares were sold by saxon and  shares were sold by forest 
the net proceeds to forest from the issuance of the shares totaled approximately  after deducting issuance costs and underwriting fees 
in august anschutz exercised an option to purchase  shares of common stock for  or approximately per share 
in november forest exchanged  shares of common stock plus approximately  in cash to extinguish approximately  of nonrecourse secured debt 
in connection with this transaction  anschutz acquired  shares of common stock by exercising warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share and by converting  shares of forest s second series preferred stock into  shares of common stock 
in february forest called for redemption all  shares of our 
convertible preferred stock 
in response to the call for redemption   shares were tendered for conversion into common stock 
we redeemed the remaining  shares 
lehman brothers inc purchased  shares of common stock to fund the cash requirement of the redemption 
this conversion and redemption eliminated all outstanding preferred stock from forest s capital structure and eliminated approximately  of annual preferred dividend payments 
in august anschutz acquired  shares of common stock through the exercise of a warrant for per share resulting in cash proceeds to forest of  the original exercise price was per share 
the reduction in the exercise price offered to anschutz reflected an approximate present value discount computed to the warrants expiration date of july  in september  pursuant to a tender offer   of forest s outstanding  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due was tendered by the holders 
the purchase price for each  principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted was 
on october  an additional  aggregate principal amount of notes was tendered at a purchase price of  for each  principal amount 
as a result of the tender offer  forest recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately  relating to the excess of the tender price over the carrying amount of the notes  net of related unamortized debt issuance costs 
also in september canadian forest completed an offering of  of notes  which were sold at of par and guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by forest 
the effects of the tender and new offering resulted in estimated annual cash savings of approximately  to  related to interest and taxes 
in february canadian forest issued  principal amount of notes  an add on to the issue of notes completed in september the net proceeds funded a portion of our purchase of interests in oil and natural gas properties in fields located onshore louisiana from a private company for total consideration of approximately  the consideration consisted of approximately  in cash and  shares of common stock 
in june forest issued  shares of common stock to anschutz in exchange for certain oil and gas assets located in the us and canada  as well as international projects 
in june we settled our only remaining nonrecourse production payment loan by issuing  shares of common stock to the lender  bank of america national trust savings association 
the loan  which originated in may  had a remaining principal amount of approximately  and a book value of approximately  the loan was secured primarily by certain oil and gas properties in oklahoma and the gulf of mexico 
as a result of the settlement  we recorded an extraordinary gain of  in in february we issued  of senior subordinated notes due which were sold at of par 
we continue to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of forest  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond forest s control 
in addition  the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production will significantly impact future operating cash flows 
at current production and borrowing levels  forest s sensitivity to price declines is significantly increased compared to prior periods 
no prediction can be made as to the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
additionally  we have six offshore gulf of mexico wells whose combined production represents approximately of our consolidated daily deliverability at march  our production  revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected if production from these properties decreases significantly 
bank credit facilities 
forest and its subsidiaries  canadian forest and promark  have a  global credit facility which currently provides for a global borrowing base of  through a syndicate of banks led by the chase manhattan bank and the chase manhattan bank of canada 
the maximum credit facility allocations in the united states and canada are currently  and  respectively 
the borrowing base is subject to semi annual redeterminations 
funds borrowed under the global credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the global credit facility  forest  canadian forest and promark are subject to certain covenants and financial tests  including restrictions or requirements with respect to cash dividends  including cash dividends on preferred stock  working capital  cash flow  additional debt  liens  asset sales  investments  mergers and reporting responsibilities 
the global credit facility is secured by a lien on  and a security interest in  a portion of our us proved oil and gas properties  related assets  pledges of accounts receivable  and a pledge of of the capital stock of canadian forest 
the global credit facility is also indirectly secured by substantially all of the assets of canadian forest 
we may increase the number of properties that are pledged under the facility 
at december   the borrowing base was  and the outstanding borrowings under the global credit facility were  in the us and  in canada 
at february   the borrowing base was  and the outstanding borrowings under the global credit facility were  in the us and  in canada  with an average effective interest rate of 
the reductions in the borrowing base and in the outstanding amount since december  were due primarily to issuance of the notes and use of the net proceeds therefrom to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the global credit facility 
at february  the company has also used the global credit facility for letters of credit in the amount of  in the us and  cdn in canada 
saxon petroleum is an unrestricted subsidiary under the terms of forest s global credit facility and its subordinated debt 
saxon  a wholly owned subsidiary of canadian forest oil ltd  has a separate credit facility with a  cdn borrowing base  of which  cdn was drawn as of february  the lender issued a notice to saxon on march  that it intends to decrease the borrowing base by  cdn 
forest is examining various alternatives with respect to this credit facility  but has the ability to fund the potential borrowing base reduction from the global credit facility if necessary 
working capital 
forest had a working capital surplus of approximately  at december  compared to approximately  at december  the decrease in the surplus is due primarily to cash used in to fund capital expenditures in the united states and canada 
in the us  forest periodically reports working capital deficits at the end of a period 
such working capital deficits are principally the result of accounts payable for capitalized exploration and development costs 
settlement of these payables is funded by cash flow from operations or  if necessary  by drawdowns on long term bank credit facilities 
for cash management purposes  drawdowns on the credit facilities are not made until the due dates of the payables 
cash flow 
historically  one of forest s primary sources of capital has been net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in compared to  in the period included higher production revenue and proceeds related to settlement of a canadian gas purchase contract  offset by lower oil and natural gas prices and higher interest costs 
the period included payment related to settlement of a volumetric production payment obligation 
we used  for investing activities in compared to  in the increase in cash used in the period is due primarily to the acquisition of properties onshore in louisiana 
cash provided by financing activities in was  compared to  in the period included  of proceeds from the issuance of notes and net drawdowns on credit facilities of approximately  the period included approximately  of proceeds from the issuance of notes   of proceeds from the exercise of a warrant by anschutz and approximately  of net drawdowns on the credit facilities  offset by approximately  used for the redemption of notes 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in compared to  in due primarily to increased production as well as higher natural gas prices being more than offset by funds used for the settlement of volumetric production payment obligations 
we used  for investing activities in compared to  in the outlays included  for the acquisition of canadian forest  whereas the outlays consist primarily of exploration and development costs 
cash provided by financing activities in was  in compared to  in the period included cash inflows from the issuance of notes  the exercise of a warrant by anschutz and net borrowings on the credit facilities  offset by cash used for the redemption of notes 
the period included  of net proceeds from a public offering of common stock 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development for the past three years were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties    undeveloped properties   exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    amounts consist primarily of oil and gas properties acquired onshore louisiana and from anschutz 
amounts consist primarily of the allocation of purchase price to the oil and gas properties acquired in the purchase of canadian forest 
forest s budgeted direct expenditures for exploration and development are approximately  we intend to meet capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations  sales of non strategic assets and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will have access to sufficient capital to meet these capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if we experience lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or other liquidity needs or could be increased if we experience increased cash flow or access additional sources of capital 
in addition  while forest intends to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet our investment criteria  no assurance can be given that we can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
dispositions of non strategic assets 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with little value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
at the present time  forest has offered for sale property packages in each of our operating regions 
during  forest disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil were disposed of in for total net proceeds of  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  in addition  saxon received proceeds of approximately  representing the liquidation of preferred shares in archean energy ltd 
these shares  which were received through a series of transactions relating to the sale of forest s canadian oil and gas properties  were transferred to saxon by forest in investment in saxon petroleum inc 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of saxon petroleum inc not previously owned by us in exchange for  shares of forest common stock 
we expect to realize general and administrative cost savings of approximately  us per year as a result of the consolidation of the operations of saxon with those of canadian forest 
year issues 
the year issue results from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  certain of forest s computer applications that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation could result in system failure  miscalculations and disruption of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  operate equipment with date sensitive computer controls or communicate electronically with other parties 
forest has instituted a year project that addresses the effects the year will have on software applications and analyzes upgrades and purchases that may be required 
in addition  the year project assesses the potential impact on forest in the event that other parties with whom we do business do not implement systems which are year compliant 
we commenced our year project in  in conjunction with a review of the functionality of the hardware and software in certain existing systems 
replacement of the lease and land system with year compliant software was completed in early review of systems solutions for our primary business applications  including those used for accounting  production reporting and oil and gas reserve reporting  was completed during and early possible solutions explored by forest included modification of existing systems to make them year compliant  replacement of existing systems with new systems which were year compliant and or provided greater functionality and  in certain areas  replacement of systems by outsourcing processes to a third party 
forest completed its review of accounting systems in early  deciding to replace its us accounting system with a new system that will be year compliant and also provide greater functionality 
the identification of necessary enhancements to the base product was completed in mid  after which the programming and data conversion processes commenced 
in canada  we plan to upgrade to a newer release of our existing oil and gas accounting software in order to be year compliant 
we expect to be fully operational on our new accounting systems in the us and canada by the third quarter of we are also installing an updated version of our us production accounting software 
the new version is year compliant and also provides greater functionality 
installation of this software commenced in mid completion of this project  which also requires updated interface programming to the accounting and reserve systems  is expected to occur in the second quarter of the company does not use an automated production reporting system in canada 
forest s us oil and gas reserve software will also be updated to a version that is year compliant 
this upgrade  which requires some revision to interface programming  is expected to be complete by the third quarter of in canada  we installed new oil and gas reserve software that is year compliant 
the new systems described above are expected to make forest s business computer systems year compliant in all material respects during the third quarter of remaining business systems have also been reviewed for year compliance 
to date  no significant instances of noncompliance have been noted 
during the course of the projects described above  there have been and will continue to be significant time requirements placed on forest s managers and staff in the affected areas 
wherever possible  we have contracted additional personnel to supplement programming efforts and to backfill critical positions so that normal workflow is not adversely affected 
however  the ability of forest s information technology staff to respond to new issues is expected to be hampered during the upcoming year due to the difficulty encountered in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
a year steering committee was formed in early consisting of representatives from the finance  accounting  legal  operations and information systems disciplines 
based on the committee s recommendations  forest entered into contracts with several consultants to provide additional support to our efforts to ensure year compliance 
in the us  a national consulting firm was engaged to assist in the identification  classification and itemization of year issues not previously identified 
this effort encompassed a review of all field operations operated and non operated  significant vendor and customer relationships and business systems not included in the projects described above 
the consulting firm has also been assisting forest personnel in the assessment and remediation of year issues 
the consultants commenced their work in november and expect to complete the project in mid canadian forest has engaged a consultant to review its business systems and has retained outside legal counsel to provide support to management in the review of third party relationships 
forest believes that its year project is approximately complete as of february  the internal and external costs associated with implementation of business systems for accounting  production reporting and oil and gas reserve reporting during and are expected to be between  and  of this amount  approximately to would have been required to make our old systems year compliant  and the remainder is for upgraded hardware and software 
the cost of the reviews being undertaken by outside consultants contracted by the year steering committee in the us and canada is expected to be  to  the remediation cost of non compliant items noted in such reviews has not yet been quantified  but is not expected to exceed  forest believes that a failure to complete year compliance  or a failure by parties with whom forest has material relationships to complete year compliance  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe we can provide the resources necessary to ensure year compliance prior to  and thereby reduce the possibility of significant interruptions of normal business operations 
we also believe that a sufficient number of alternate customers and suppliers exist if current customers or suppliers are delayed in their efforts to achieve year compliance 
forest has not  to date  implemented a year contingency plan because it is our goal to have major issues resolved by mid if  however  forest s year project falls behind schedule  we would expect to develop and implement a year contingency plan by mid recent accounting pronouncement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
 effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal years beginning after june  statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the company has not determined the impact statement no 
will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk forest is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk forest produces and sells natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids for its own account in the us and canada and  through its marketing subsidiary promark  markets natural gas for third parties in canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to manage commodity prices and to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices  we enter into long term contracts and use a hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  forest enters into energy swaps and other financial instruments 
we use the hedge or deferral method of accounting for these activities and  as a result  gains and losses on the related instruments are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
promark also enters into trading activities on a limited basis in canada 
long term sales contracts 
a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the promark netback pool 
at december  the promark netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell approximately bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf and approximately bcf of natural gas in at an average price of approximately cdn per mcf 
canadian forest  as one of the producers in the promark netback pool  is obligated to deliver a portion of this gas 
in canadian forest supplied of the gas for the netback pool 
hedging program 
in a typical swap agreement  forest receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  forest pays the difference 
our current swaps are settled on a monthly basis 
at december  forest had natural gas swaps for an aggregate of approximately bbtu billion british thermal units per day of natural gas during at fixed prices ranging from per mmbtu million british thermal units on an alberta energy company c aeco c basis to per mmbtu on a new york mercantile exchange nymex basis and an aggregate of approximately bbtu per day of natural gas during at fixed prices ranging from to per mmbtu nymex basis 
the weighted average hedged price for natural gas under such agreements is and per mmbtu in and  respectively 
forest had no oil swaps in place at december  subsequent to december  we entered into oil swaps for  barrels of oil per day from march to december at a weighted average fixed price of per barrel nymex basis 
trading activities 
in addition to operating the promark netback pool and managing long term gas supply contracts for industrial customers on a fee for service basis  promark also buys and sells natural gas in its trading operations 
profits or losses generated by trading are based on the spread between the prices of natural gas purchased and sold 
promark follows procedures to offset its gas purchase or sales commitments with gas purchase or sales contracts  thereby limiting its exposure to price risk 
at december   promark s trading operations had contracts to purchase an aggregate of bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf and had contracts to sell an aggregate of bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf 
foreign currency exchange risk forest conducts business in several foreign currencies and thus is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
canada 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of canadian forest 
as a result  canadian forest is exposed to foreign currency translation risk related to translation of the principal amount of the notes issued by it in late and early because these notes are denominated in us dollars 
the  principal amount of the debt is due in the year operations outside of north america 
the foreign interests acquired from anschutz in are in relatively early stages of exploratory activities 
expenditures incurred relative to these interests subsequent to their acquisition have been primarily us dollar denominated 
interest rate risk at the present time  forest has no financial instruments in place to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
therefore  our exposure to changes in interest rates results from short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts and related average interest rates by year of maturity for forest s debt obligations at december  thereafter total fair value in thousands bank credit facilities variable rate    average interest rate long term debt fixed rate     average interest rate
