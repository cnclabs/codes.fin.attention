item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements set forth therein 
general delta financial corporation the company or delta engages in the consumer finance business by originating  acquiring  selling and servicing non conforming home equity loans 
throughout its year operating history  the company has focused on lending to individuals who generally have impaired or limited credit profiles or higher debt to income ratios 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  delta funding corporation delta funding  the company originates home equity loans indirectly through licensed mortgage brokers and other real estate professionals who submit loan applications on behalf of the borrower brokered loans and also purchases loans from mortgage bankers and smaller financial institutions that satisfy delta s underwriting guidelines correspondent loans 
delta funding currently originates and purchases the majority of its loans in states  through its network of approximately  brokers and correspondents 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  fidelity mortgage  the company develops retail loan leads retail loans primarily through its telemarketing system and its network of retail offices located in states 
through a strategic alliance between dfc funding of canada limited  an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of delta funding corporation  and mcap mortgage corporation  a canadian mortgage loan originator  the company originated loans in canada 
in february  the company decided to close its canadian business to focus exclusively on its us based business 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy  delta sells the majority of its loans through securitization and derives a substantial portion of its income therefrom 
in a securitization  the company sells a pool of loans it has originated or purchased to a remic trust for a cash purchase price 
the trust  in turn  finances the purchase of the pool of loans it has acquired by selling pass through certificates  or bonds  which represent undivided ownership interests in the trust 
holders of the pass through certificates are entitled to receive monthly distributions of all principal received on the underlying mortgages and a specified amount of interest  as determined at the time of the trust offering 
when the company sells a pool of loans to a securitization trust  it receives the following economic interests in the trust a the difference between the interest payments due on the loans sold to the trust and the interest rate paid to the pass through certificateholders  less the company s contractual servicing fee and other costs and expenses of administering the trust  represented by interest only and residual certificates  and b the right to service the loans on behalf of the trust and earn a servicing fee  as well as other ancillary servicing related fees directly from the borrowers on the underlying loans 
the company s net investment in the pool of loans sold at the date of the securitization represents the amount originally paid to originate or acquire the loan adjusted for i any direct loan origination costs incurred an increase and loan origination fees received a decrease in connection with the loans  which are treated as a component of the initial investment in a loan under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for non refundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  and ii the principal payments received  and the amortization of the net loan fees or costs  during the period the company held the loans prior to their securitization 
the company s investment in the loans also reflects adjustments for any gains a decrease in the investment or losses an increase in the investment the company has incurred on treasury rate lock contracts which the company has typically used to hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates during the period it holds the loans prior to their securitization 
see hedging 
upon the securitization of a pool of loans  the company i recognizes in income  as origination fees  the unamortized origination fees included in the investment in the loans sold  and ii recognizes a gain on sale of loans equal to the difference between cash received from the trust and the investment in the loans remaining after the allocation of portions of that investment to record interest only and residual certificates and mortgage servicing rights received in the securitization 
the majority of the net gain on sale of mortgage loans results from  and is initially realized in the form of  the retention of interest only and residual certificates 
the company sold interest only certificates created in each of the securitizations for cash proceeds and intends to continue to sell the interest only certificate as long as the sale effectively maximizes cash flow and profitability 
the interest only and residual certificates received by the company upon the securitization of a pool of loans are accounted for as trading securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount initially allocated to the interest only and residual certificates at the date of a securitization reflects the fair value of those interests 
the amount recorded for the certificates is reduced for distributions thereon which the company receives from the related trust  and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of interest only and residual certificates  which are reflected in the statement of operations 
the company assesses the fair value of interest only and residual certificates based upon updated estimates of prepayment and default rates relating to loan groups comprised of loans of similar types  terms  credit quality  interest rates  geographic location and value of loan collateral  which represent the predominant risk characteristics that would affect prepayments and default rates 
the company values the mortgage servicing rights it retains in a securitization under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount of the investment in the loans allocated to the retained servicing rights is measured at the allocated carrying amount of such servicing rights  based on the fair value of the servicing rights 
the fair value of the servicing rights is determined by discounting to a present value using a discount rate which management believes reflects the rate market participants would utilize in purchasing similar loan servicing rights the estimated future contractual and ancillary servicing fees the company will receive and the estimated costs of servicing the loans 
those estimates are based on the stated terms of the transferred loans adjusted for estimates of future prepayment rates made on the basis of interest rate conditions and the availability of alternative financing  and estimates of future defaults among those loans  each of which would terminate the servicing of the loan and thus negatively affect servicing income 
the fair value of the servicing rights  which is classified on the balance sheet as capitalized mortgage servicing rights  is then amortized over the period of the estimated net future cash flows from the servicing income 
sfas no 
also requires that the capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights be assessed periodically to determine if there has been any impairment of the value of the asset  based on the date of the assessment 
the company performs this assessment based on the same prepayment and default estimates used to value interest only and residual certificates 
a valuation allowance is provided for the capitalized servicing rights relating to any loan group for which the recorded investment exceeds the fair value of the servicing rights 
in recording and accounting for mortgage servicing rights and interest only and residual certificates  the company makes estimates of rates of prepayments and defaults  and the value of collateral  which it believes reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions then in effect 
the actual rate of prepayments  defaults and the value of collateral will generally differ from the estimates used due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions and the implicit imprecision of estimates  and such differences can be material 
prepayment and default rates  which are higher than those estimated  would adversely affect the value of both the mortgage servicing rights actual mortgage servicing income will be less  and significant changes could require an impairment of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the interest only and residual certificates  for which changes in fair value are recorded in operations 
conversely  prepayment and default rates  which are lower than those estimated  would increase the servicing income earned over the life of the loans and positively impact the value of the interest only and residual certificates 
there are currently two methods used to calculate the present value of the residual interests  the cash in and cash out methods 
the cash in method assumes value as the residual cash flow is received by the securitization trust even if it is used to create an overcollateralization provision 
in contrast  the cash out method assumes value at the time the residual cash flow is actually received by the residual certificate holder delta from the securitization trust  which is only after the required overcollateralization provision has been met 
as the company receives residual cash flows from the securitization trust  generally to months following the primary issuance  these two methods will create dramatically different values 
the company uses the more conservative cash out method  which calculates value at the time the residual cash flow is actually received by delta 
the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission have issued proposals relating to sfas no 
that would require companies to use the cash out more conservative  not the cash in more aggressive  method in accounting for the value of the retained interest residual in securitizations and overcollateralization assets 
this would result in one time residual asset write downs for companies that currently use the cash in method 
the company has always used the more conservative cash out method for accounting and will not be susceptible to a write down as a result of this proposed accounting change 
fair value adjustments during the second quarter of  the company recorded a million reduction in the carrying amount of its interest only and residual certificates  and also recorded a million reduction in the carrying amount of its capitalized mortgage servicing rights to reflect a provision for impairment the fair value adjustments 
both impairment provisions resulted from reductions in the company s estimates of the fair value of those assets 
the reductions in the estimated fair value resulted from a change in the prepayment assumptions used by the company to estimate the future cash flows to be derived from the interest only and residual certificates and the mortgage servicing rights 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  at each reporting period the company estimates the fair value of its interest only and residual certificates and its capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
the carrying amount of the interest only and residual certificates is adjusted to their current fair value 
for capitalized mortgage servicing rights  a valuation allowance is recorded if the fair value of such rights is less than the carrying amount 
the fair values of both interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights are significantly affected by  among other factors  prepayments of loans and estimates of future prepayment rates 
the company continually reviews its prepayment assumptions in light of company and industry experience and makes adjustments to those assumptions when such experience indicates 
during  the company made certain changes in its prepayment assumptions  principally increasing the estimated maximum prepayment rates for adjustable rate loan pools 
the effect of that change in prepayment assumptions did not materially affect the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates in the company s review of its prepayment experience and assumptions at june  indicated that the prepayment rates during  particularly for adjustable rate mortgages arms  and in particular during the second quarter of  were higher than those historically experienced  or previously projected  by the company 
the company believes that these increases in prepayment rates were attributable to the continuation  for a longer period than historically experienced  of low interest rates  together with changes  to a flatter or inverted curve  of the relationship between long term and short term interest rates the yield curve 
as a result  at june   the company adjusted its prepayment assumptions  increasing the maximum prepayment rates for all loans  and changing the rate at which prepayments are assumed to increase from the initial rate to the maximum rate from a straight line build up to a vector curve 
these revised prepayment assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights retained by the company in securitizations completed prior to the second quarter of  requiring the fair value adjustments described above 
these revised prepayment assumptions were also used in initially valuing and recording the interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights retained by the company in its securitizations completed subsequent to the first quarter of the company assumes prepayment rates and defaults based upon the seasoning of its existing securitization loan portfolio 
the following table compares the prepayment assumptions used subsequent to the first quarter of the new assumptions with those used at december  and through the first quarter of the old assumptions loan type curve description month speed peak speed new old new old new old fixed rate loans vector ramp six month libor arms vector ramp hybrid arms vector ramp in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the company increased its loss reserve initially established for both fixed and adjustable rate loans sold to the securitizations trusts to approximately of the issuance amount securitized from approximately of the issuance amount 
the company made this change to better reflect what management believes its loss experience will be  as the company anticipates slower prepayment rates and a flat to slight moderate rise in home values as compared to the past few years  which may have an adverse effect on the company s non performing loans 
this change resulted in approximately a million reduction in the company s value of the residual and interest only certificates 
an annual discount rate of was utilized in determining the present value of cash flows from residual certificates  using the cash out method  which are the predominant form of retained interests at both december  and the company uses the same prepayment assumptions in estimating the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
to date  aggregate actual cash flows from the company s securitization trusts have either met or exceeded management s expectations and the company determined that no further adjustments to the prepayment or default assumptions was necessary at december  results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general the company s net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  comments regarding the components of net income are detailed in the following paragraphs 
revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in origination fees and the net gains recognized on the sale of mortgage loans  reflecting the growth in the company s level of loan originations and purchases and securitizations 
in addition  servicing fees increased due to an increase in the aggregate size of the company s loan servicing portfolio 
these increases were significantly offset by a decline in interest income primarily due to the fair value adjustments made to the company s interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights in the second and fourth quarters of see fair value adjustments and a larger than normal hedge loss which was not offset by a higher gain on sale because asset backed investors who purchase the pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts demanded wider spreads see net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
the company originated and purchased billion of mortgage loans for the twelve months ended december   representing a increase from billion of mortgage loans originated and purchased for the comparable period in the company completed four securitizations and loan sales in totaling billion  compared to four securitizations totaling billion in total loans serviced increased to billion at december  from billion at december  net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans represents the sum of a the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates retained by the company in a securitization for each period and the market value of the interest only certificates sold in connection with each securitization  b the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights associated with loans securitized in each period  and c premiums earned on the sale of whole loans on a servicing released basis  less the x premiums paid to originate or acquire mortgage loans  y costs associated with securitizations and z any hedge loss gain associated with a particular securitization 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to a increase in the amount of loans securitized or sold on a whole loan basis to billion in  compared to billion of loans securitized in  but was partially offset by a lower weighted average net gain on sale ratio 
the weighted average net gain on sale ratio was in compared to in net gain on the sale of loans increased less than the overall increase in loan securitizations primarily due to a the company s change to more conservative prepayment assumptions used in initially valuing the residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights acquired subsequent to the first quarter of see fair value adjustments  and b the impact of a hedging loss during the third quarter of resulting from lower interest rates that was not offset by a higher gain on sale due to substantially wider spreads demanded by asset backed investors who purchase the pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts 
interest income 
interest income primarily represents the sum of the difference between the distributions the company receives on its interest only and residual certificates and the adjustments recorded to reflect changes in the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates  interest earned on loans held for sale  and interest earned on cash collection balances 
interest income decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to the million and million fair value adjustments made during the second and fourth quarters of to the interest only and residual certificates previously discussed see fair value adjustments 
the effect of that adjustment was partially offset by increases in a interest only and residual certificates income  b interest on loans held for sale due to higher average balances  partially offset by a decline  from to  in the weighted average coupon rate on the mortgage loans  reflecting both a lower interest rate environment and the company s shift to higher credit quality loans and c interest on bank deposits resulting from a higher average balance held in securitization trust accounts by the company 
servicing fees 
servicing fees represent all contractual and ancillary servicing revenue received by the company less the offsetting amortization of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights  and any adjustments recorded to provide valuation allowances for the impairment in mortgage servicing rights see certain accounting considerations  and prepaid interest shortfalls 
servicing fees increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the aggregate size of the company s servicing portfolio  partially offset by the recording of the million provision for the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights

the weighted average gain on sale ratio for the twelve months ended december   and for the comparable period in  was and  respectively 
the weighted average gain on sale ratio is calculated using the net gain on sale divided by the total amount of loans securitized and sold 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to a a higher average balance of mortgage loans held for sale during the twelve months ended december  driven by higher loan originations and purchases as noted above  and b an increase in excess servicing received from the company s interest only and residual certificates  partially offset by the fair value adjustment to the interest only and residual certificates  primarily related to distributions received from the securitization trusts 
servicing fees 
servicing fees increased million  or  to million for he twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio  which resulted in increased contractual and ancillary service fees  partially offset by a million increase in amortization of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights in  compared to the average balance of mortgage loans serviced by the company increased to billion for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the amount of mortgage loans serviced by the company increased at a faster rate than the amount of servicing fees  primarily as a result of a reduction in the contractual servicing fee rate from to per annum beginning with the securitization in september origination fees

income taxes provided a effective tax rate for the year ended december   compared to a assumed effective tax rate for the year ended december  if the company would have been a c corporation for the entire period 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the company s expansion into lower taxing state and local jurisdictions 
financial condition december  compared to december  cash and interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily the result of additional monies held in securitization trust accounts by the company  acting as servicer for its ongoing securitization program 
accounts receivable decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the receipt of a federal tax refund  partially offset by an increase in reimbursable servicing advances made by the company  acting as servicer on its securitizations  related to a higher average servicing portfolio 
the company s servicing portfolio increased to billion as of december  from billion as of december  loans held for sale increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the net difference between loan originations and loans securitized during accrued interest and late charges receivable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to a larger loan servicing portfolio  which resulted in increased reimbursable interest advances made by the company  acting as servicer on its securitizations 
capitalized mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was directly attributable to the company s capitalizing the fair market value of the servicing assets  totaling million  resulting from the company s completion of four securitizations during  partially offset by the amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the fair value adjustment to the capitalized mortgage servicing rights see fair value adjustments 
interest only and residual certificates increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to the company s receipt of residual certificates valued and recorded at million from its securitizations during the year ended december  the increase was offset by the effect of the fair value adjustment see fair value adjustments and normal amortization due to cash distributions 
equipment  net  increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to capital expenditures related to new technology and expansion 
cash held for advance payments increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio resulting in additional monies held in escrow trust accounts by the company  acting as servicer 
warehouse financing and other borrowings increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily related to the operating cash deficit and to a lesser extent  the funding of the company s investment in technology 
the aggregate principal balance of the senior notes  net of unamortized bond discount totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the senior notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually on february and august accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in current income taxes payable  various operating accruals and an increase in the provision for recourse loans 
investor payable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the company s portfolio of serviced loans to billion at december  from billion at december  investor payable is comprised of all principal collected on mortgage loans and accrued interest 
variability in this account is primarily due to the principal payments collected within a given collection period 
advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio and the timing of payments collected and disbursed resulting in additional monies held in escrow trust accounts by the company acting as a servicer 
stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to net income for the twelve month period of million  the issuance of million of the company s common stock paid to the sellers of fidelity mortgage in august  partially offset by the company s repurchase of  shares of its common stock for million 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically operated on a negative cash flow basis primarily due to increases in the volume of loan purchases and originations and the growth of its securitization program 
in recent quarters  however  the company reduced its negative cash flow and achieved a positive cash flow during the fourth quarter of the company s focus is to maintain a neutral cash flow position for the foreseeable future  as a result of aggregate annual increased cash inflows from the company s retained interest only and residual certificates  advantageous changes in the securitizations structures the company has used and a greater concentration on less cash intensive broker and retail originations 
since the second quarter of  the company has sold the senior interest only certificates in each of its securitizations and  in the company s four most recent securitizations  it has successfully increased the amount of senior interest only certifcates offered to investors  compared to prior securitizations 
for the years ended december  and  the company had operating cash deficits of million and million  respectively 
the improvement in the company s operating cash deficit in  compared to  was primarily due to increased cash inflows from the company s retained interest only and residual certificates  changes in the securitization structures that the company has utilized  an increase in the company s restricted cash held for securitization trust accounts and a lower percentage of correspondent loan purchases and lower purchased premiums  a tax refund  partially offset by the semi annual senior note interest payments made in february and august currently  the company s primary cash requirements include the funding of i mortgage originations and purchases pending their pooling and sale  ii the points and expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of correspondent loans  iii interest expense on its senior notes and warehouse and other financings  iv fees  expenses and tax payments incurred in connection with its securitization program and v ongoing administrative and other operating expenses 
the company has relied upon a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for its loan originations and purchases 
the company must be able to sell loans and obtain adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding in order to continue to originate and purchase loans 
historically  the company has utilized various financing facilities and an equity financing to offset negative operating cash flows and support the continued growth of its loan originations and purchases  securitizations and general operating expenses 
on july   the company completed its offering of the senior notes 
a portion of the senior notes proceeds were used to pay down various financing facilities with the remainder used to fund the company s growth in loan originations and purchases and its ongoing securitization program 
the company s primary sources of liquidity continue to be warehouse and other financing facilities  securitizations and  subject to market conditions  sales of whole loans and additional debt and equity securities 
to accumulate loans for securitization  the company borrows money on a short term basis through warehouse lines of credit 
the company currently has three warehouse facilities for this purpose 
one warehouse facility is a million committed credit line with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of march this facility was converted from an uncommitted to a committed line during the three months ended march  and the maturity date was extended from february to march during the three months ended march  the company s second warehouse facility is a syndicated million committed revolving line with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of june this facility was increased from million to million during the three months ended june  the company s third warehouse facility is a million committed commercial paper conduit with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of september additionally  the company obtained a fourth warehouse facility a million committed credit facility with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of march during the three months ended march  the outstanding balances on the million  million  and million facilities as of december  were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company has in the past obtained financing facilities for interest only and residual certificates acquired as part of its securitizations 
in july  all outstanding balances were eliminated using a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes 
in addition  the company is limited by the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes as to the amount of future indebtedness permitted to be secured by interest only and residual certificates 
the company is required to comply with various operating and financial covenants as provided in the agreements described above which are customary for agreements of their type 
the company does not believe that its existing financial covenants will restrict its operations or growth 
the continued availability of funds provided to the company under these agreements is subject to the company s continued compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the company is in compliance with all such covenants under these agreements as of december  the company purchased a total of  shares of its common stock during the year ended december   under the company s stock repurchase program  at a total cost of million 
all of the repurchased shares were purchased in open market transactions at then prevailing market prices 
interest rate risk among the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
profitability may be directly affected by the level of  and fluctuation in  interest rates  which affect the company s ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans and the costs of its borrowings  which are tied to various united states treasury maturities  commercial paper rates and the london inter bank offered rate libor 
the profitability of the company is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the company s ability to purchase and originate loans 
a significant decline in interest rates could increase the level of loan prepayments thereby decreasing the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio 
to the extent servicing rights and interest only and residual classes of certificates have been capitalized on the books of the company  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require the company to write down the value of such servicing rights and interest only and residual certificates  adversely impacting earnings 
as previously discussed  the fair value adjustments that the company recorded in the second quarter of were primarily attributable to the company s change in prepayment assumptions to reflect higher than originally anticipated rates of prepayments see fair value adjustments 
in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk  the company has reviewed its various mortgage products and has identified and modified those that have proven historically more susceptible to prepayments 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications to its product line will effectively mitigate interest rate risk in the future 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held pending sales and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse facilities  although the company undertakes to hedge its exposure to this risk by using treasury rate lock contracts 
see hedging below 
hedging the company originates and purchases mortgage loans and then sells them primarily through securitizations 
at the time of securitization and delivery of the loans  the company recognizes gain on sale based on a number of factors including the difference  or spread  between the interest rate on the loans and the interest rate paid to asset backed investors who purchase pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts  which historically was generally related to the interest rate on treasury securities with maturities corresponding to the anticipated life of the loans 
if interest rates rise between the time the company originates or purchases the loans and the time the loans are sold at securitization  the excess spread narrows  resulting in a loss in value of the loans 
the company has implemented a strategy to protect against such losses and to reduce interest rate risk on loans originated and purchased that have not yet been securitized through the use of treasury rate lock contracts with various durations which are similar to selling a combination of united states treasury securities  which equate to a similar duration of the underlying loans 
the nature and quantity of hedging transactions are determined by the company based upon various factors including  without limitation  market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage originations and purchases 
the company will enter into treasury rate lock contracts through one of its warehouse lenders and or one of the investment bankers which underwrite the company s securitizations 
these contracts are designated as hedges in the company s records and are closed out when the associated loans are sold through securitization 
if the value of the hedges decrease  offsetting an increase in the value of the loans  the company  upon settlement with its counterparty  will pay the hedge loss in cash and realize the corresponding increase in the value of the loans as part of its net gain on sale of mortgage loans and its corresponding interest only and residual certificates 
conversely  if the value of the hedges increase  offsetting a decrease in the value of the loans  the company  upon settlement with its counterparty  will receive the hedge gain in cash and realize the corresponding decrease in the value of the loans through a reduction in the value of the corresponding interest only and residual certificates 
up to and including the second quarter of  the company believed that its hedging strategy of using treasury rate lock contracts was the most effective way to manage its interest rate risk on loans prior to securitization 
however  in the third quarter of  asset backed investors  responding to lower treasury yields and global financial market volatility  demanded substantially wider spreads over treasuries than historically experienced for newly issued asset backed securities 
as a result  delta s million hedge loss resulting from lower interest rates was not offset by a higher gain on sale as the company has historically seen 
given the company s belief that the volatile market experienced in the third quarter would likely continue well into the fourth quarter and  as a result  that the amount of the spreads demanded by asset backed securitization investors would be difficult to predict  as asset backed securitization investors were more interested in absolute yields  instead of spreads over treasuries the company did not hedge any of its warehoused loans pending securitization in the fourth quarter  believing that its historical hedging strategy would continue to be largely ineffective in such an environment 
the company has continued to review its hedging strategy in order to best mitigate risk pending securitization 
as the asset backed securitization market improved in the first quarter of  and spreads over treasuries became largely more predictable  the company resumed its hedging strategy of selling treasury rate lock contracts to mitigate its interest rate risk pending securitization 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the area of loan originations and can have a substantial effect on interest rates 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation

impact of new accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors except for historical information contained herein  certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act pslra of  which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and business environment  and are subject to change on various important factors 
the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors discussed below  among others  in some cases have caused  and in the future could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the following include some  but not all  of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from projections the company s ability or inability to continue to access lines of credit  including without limitation  warehouse and other credit facilities used to finance newly originated mortgage loans held for sale 
the company s ability or inability to continue its practice of securitization of mortgage loans held for sale 
a general economic slowdown 
periods of economic slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining real estate values 
because of the company s focus on credit impaired borrowers  the actual rate of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses on loans affected by the borrowers reduced ability to use home equity to support borrowings could be higher than those generally experienced in the mortgage lending industry 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  foreclosure  losses or increased costs could adversely affect the company s ability to securitize or sell loans in the secondary market 
the effects of interest rate fluctuations and the company s ability or inability to hedge effectively against such fluctuations in interest rates  the effect of changes in monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  other activities of governments  agencies  and similar organizations  social and economic conditions  unforeseen inflationary pressures and monetary fluctuation 
rapid or unforeseen escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and or litigation  including but not limited to  environmental compliance  licenses  adoption of new  or changes in accounting polices and practices and the application of such polices and practices 
failure to comply with various federal  state and local regulations  accounting policies  and environmental compliance can lead to loss of approved status  certain rights of rescission for mortgage loans  class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement action 
increased competition within the company s markets has taken on many forms  such as convenience in obtaining a loan  customer service  marketing and distribution channels  loan origination fees and interest rates 
the company is currently competing with large finance companies and conforming mortgage originators many of whom have greater financial  technological and marketing resources 
the unanticipated expenses of assimilating newly acquired businesses into the company s structure  as well as the impact of unusual expenses from ongoing evaluations of business strategies  asset valuations  acquisitions  divestitures and organizational structures 
unpredictable delays or difficulties in development of new product programs 
year compliance and technology enhancements 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct  reprogram or replace  and test its systems for year compliance 
although to date  the company has been completing its year compliance efforts on time  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unexpected delay there can also be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely reprogrammed for year compliance 
information services year project the year issue centers on the inability of certain computer hardware and software systems and associated applications to correctly recognize and process dates beyond december  many computer programs used by the company  its suppliers and outside service providers were developed using only six digits to define the date field two fields each for the month  day and year and may recognize as the year  rather than the year due to the nature of financial information  if corrective action is not taken  calculations that rely on the integrity of the date field for the processing of information could be significantly misstated 
state of readiness the company has implemented a detailed year plan the plan to evaluate the year readiness of the computer systems that support the operation of the company including vendor computer systems 
this plan is expected to conclude in june with all systems year compliant 
the plan includes upgrading the origination system software  upgrading the loan servicing software  upgrading the accounting system software  upgrading the wide area network software  assessing the proper integration of all systems and communicating with vendors and liquidity providers to ascertain their year compliance 
to date the accounting system is year compliant and vendors and liquidity providers have been contacted regarding their readiness 
results of system tests conducted by the company and other service providers will continue to be carefully monitored to ensure that all issues have been identified and addressed 
the company believes it has developed an effective plan to address the year issue and that based on the available information  the execution of the plan will not have any significant or material impact to the company s ability to operate before  during or after the transition to the new millennium 
however  the company has no control over the process of third parties in addressing their own year issues and  if the necessary changes are not effected or are not completed in a timely manner  or if unanticipated problems arise  there may be a material impact on the company s financial condition and result of operations 
cost to address the company s year issues the company s costs to resolve the year issue are not expected to have a material financial impact on the company and are expected to be less than million  which the company intends to fund from its current operations 
to date  the company has paid and expensed million 
however  as stated above  there can be no assurance that all such costs have been identified  or that there may not be some unforeseen cost which may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risk of year issues to date  the company has not identified any system which presents a material risk of failing to be year complaint in a timely manner  or for which a suitable alternative cannot be implemented 
however  as the company progresses with its plan  systems or equipment may be identified which present a material risk of business interruption 
such disruption may include the inability to process customer accounting transactions  the inability to process loan applications  the inability to reconcile and record daily activity  the inability to track delinquencies  or the inability to generate checks or to clear funds 
in addition  if any of the company s liquidity providers should fail to achieve the year compliance and they experience a disruption of their own businesses which prevents them from fulfilling their obligations  the company may be materially impacted 
to the extent that the risks posed by the year issue  which are beyond the company s control  are pervasive in data processing  utility and telecommunication services worldwide  the company cannot predict with certainty that it will remain materially unaffected by issues related to the year problem 
contingency plans as part of the plan implemented by the company  periodic assessments are made to determine that all year issues will be addressed prior to the new millennium 
if this assessment determines that any systems are not year compliant  and will not become year compliant in a timely manner  then a contingency plan to implement a suitable alternative will be put in place 
at this time all systems are expected to be compliant and no contingency plan is in place 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates between the time the company originates or purchases mortgage loans and the time the company sells such mortgage loans at securitization can affect the value of the company s mortgage loans held for sale and  consequently  the company s net gain on sale revenue by affecting the excess spread between the interest rate on the mortgage loans and the interest rate paid to asset backed investors who purchase pass through certificates issued by the securirzation trusts 
if interest rates rise between the time the company originates or purchases the loans and the time the loans are sold at securitization  the excess spread generally narrows  resulting in a loss in value of the loans and a lower net gain on sale 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates  which historically has resulted in approximately a basis point decrease in the excess spread  would be expected to reduce the company s net gain on sale by approximately basis points 
many factors  however  can affect the sensitivity analysis described above including  without limitation  the structure and credit enhancement used in a particular securitization  the company s prepayment  loss and discount rate assumptions  and the spread over treasuries demanded by asset backed investors who purchase the company s asset backed securities 
to reduce its financial exposure to changes in interest rates  the company generally hedges its mortgage loans held for sale by entering into treasury rate lock contracts see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hedging 
the company s hedging strategy has largely been an effective tool to manage the company s interest rate risk on loans prior to securitization  by providing the company with a cash gain or loss to largely offset the reduced increased excess spread and resultant lower or higher net gain on sale from an increase decrease in interest rates 
a hedge may not  however  perform its intended purpose of offsetting changes in net gain on sale 
this was the case in the third quarter of  when asset backed investors  responding to lower treasury yields and global financial market volatility  demanded substantially wider spreads over treasuries than historically experienced for newly issued asset backed securities 
as a result  delta s million hedge loss resulting from lower interest rates was not offset by a higher gain on sale as the company has historically seen 
changes in interest rates could also adversely affect the company s ability to purchase and originate loans and or could affect the level of loan prepayments thereby impacting the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio and the value of the company s interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights
