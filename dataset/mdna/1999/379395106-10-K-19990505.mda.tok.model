item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
components of operating income revenues 
globe s revenues are derived from corporate housing rental income  furniture leases and the sale of new and used furniture 
rental revenues are recognized in the month in which they are earned 
furniture sales revenues and rental buyout revenues are recognized when the furniture is delivered to the customer or taken off lease by the customer 
globe derives additional revenues from various fees which are included in the applicable corporate housing  rental and retail sales revenue categories 
intercompany revenues  consisting of furniture and housewares rentals to corporate housing affiliates  are eliminated in consolidation 
cost of revenues 
cost of corporate housing sales consists primarily of housing unit rental and various furniture  housewares  utility and cleaning charges 
cost of rental sales consists primarily of housewares expenses and lease buyout related charges 
cost of retail sales is primarily the depreciated book value of the furniture sold 
furniture depreciation and disposals are reflected as a separate component of cost of revenues 
as a result of the ongoing integration of the company s business  these expenses cannot be related to specific revenue categories 
furniture is depreciated on a straight line basis at a rate of per month  which is designed to approximate an estimated useful life of four years with provision for a residual value 
intercompany costs  consisting of furniture and housewares rentals to corporate housing affiliates  are eliminated in consolidation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include warehousing  occupancy  selling  advertising  administrative and other operating expenses and non rental depreciation 
amortization 
goodwill and other intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to years 
general globe is a major participant in the temporary relocation industry  operating in both the corporate housing and furniture rental businesses 
the corporate housing business provides short term housing through an inventory of leased housing units to transferring or temporarily assigned corporate personnel  new hires  trainees  consultants and individual customers 
the furniture rental business rents quality office and residential furniture to a variety of corporate and individual customers 
additionally  the company sells residential and office furniture that no longer meets its showroom condition standards for rental through its clearance centers and sells new furniture through its showrooms and account executives 
results of operations globe s increase in total revenues to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and in operating income to million from million over the same period is mainly attributable to acquisitions  particularly acquisitions in the corporate housing business 
the company s business mix has changed since fiscal  with furniture rental revenues decreasing to of total revenues in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal  while corporate housing revenues  which were non existent in fiscal  represented of total revenues in fiscal additionally  retail sales have decreased to of total revenues in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal this shift in business mix reflects the company s decision in fiscal to become a consolidator in the corporate housing business 
the percentage of revenues represented by corporate housing is expected to increase in the future 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain income statement data as a percentage of total revenues and certain gross profit data as a percentage of respective corporate housing  rental and retail sales revenues 
years ended february  revenues corporate housing sales rental sales retail sales total revenues gross profit corporate housing sales na na rental sales retail sales gross profit before depreciation and disposals furniture depreciation and disposals combined gross profit operating expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income interest other income before taxes impact of grantree and corporate housing acquisitions in january  globe acquired all of the outstanding common stock of grantree  a west coast based furniture rental company  for million 
at the time of the acquisition  grantree was experiencing significant operational problems and declining revenues 
management s initial strategy with respect to grantree was to reduce operating expenses and to reverse the declining revenue trend  which was largely accomplished by the end of fiscal from the date of the grantree acquisition through november  the company s reported cost of revenues was favorably impacted as furniture was sold to retail customers or bought out by lease customers due to the adoption of fresh start reporting in march  at which time grantree reduced the net book value of its rental furniture by approximately million  and the million amount by which the book value for grantree exceeded the purchase price paid by the company collectively  the grantree gross profit accounting effects 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain income statement data as a percentage of total revenues adjusted to exclude the effect of the grantree gross profit accounting effects on fiscal and results 
years ended february  combined gross profit operating income income before taxes globe entered the corporate housing business in fiscal by making three acquisitions 
seven additional corporate housing businesses were acquired in fiscal globe continued its corporate housing acquisition program in fiscal with the asset acquisitions of feld corporate housing in may  village suites in june and castleton and corporate condominiums in january castleton of tulsa was acquired in march  subsequent to fiscal year end 
all acquisitions to date have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
corporate housing companies assets consist primarily of accounts receivable  customer deposits and some minor furniture and fixed asset balances 
consequently  the purchase price for these businesses is allocated largely to goodwill and other intangibles 
cost of goodwill and other intangibles related to corporate housing acquisitions approximates million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to years  with a weighted average life of approximately years 
goodwill and intangibles amortization  which is a separate component of operating expenses  reduced operating profit by million  or of sales  in fiscal  by million  or of sales  in fiscal  and by million  or of sales  in fiscal the corporate housing business has a slightly lower operating margin than the furniture rental business  consisting of a lower gross profit margin offset somewhat by lower operating expenses 
as a result  the company s gross profit margin and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have been declining since the company entered the corporate housing business in fiscal gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal  resulting from corporate housing s increasing percentage of total revenues in fiscal versus and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit margin on rental sales in fiscal was versus for corporate housing 
comparable gross profit margins for fiscal were and  respectively 
because the company is integrating its furniture rental and corporate housing operations  these gross profit percentages exclude furniture depreciation and disposals which can no longer be related to specific revenue categories 
an additional result of this integration is that operating expenses and  therefore  operating margins for furniture rental and corporate housing cannot be specifically identified 
operating expenses  excluding amortization  decreased to of revenues in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal  while the operating margin  excluding amortization  decreased to of revenues in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in operating margin is primarily the result of the increasing mix of corporate housing revenues  as well as additions to the company s management team and related infrastructure spending to support the company s rapid growth 
including amortization expenses  operating margins declined to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal globe plans to continue its consolidation of corporate housing through additional acquisitions  thereby capitalizing on the desire of many corporations to have a corporate housing company that can meet their needs nationally 
with the acquisitions to date  globe has expanded its presence into markets and is the market leader in ten of these markets  with annualized corporate housing revenues of approximately million 
globe is vying with two other corporate housing companies for the number two position in the industry based on revenues 
a major risk of globe s increasing presence in the corporate housing business is the potential loss of furniture rental revenues from competing corporate housing companies that are also customers 
to date  the majority of this business with unaffiliated customers has been retained  which is largely attributable to the company s superior level of service 
additionally  the significance of this risk has lessened over the three years that globe has been in corporate housing 
in fiscal  unaffiliated corporate housing customers accounted for million  or  of globe s revenues 
during this time period  furniture rental revenues from affiliated corporate housing providers  which are not included in reported revenues  increased to million 
due to the significant impact of the grantree acquisition and the related grantree gross profit accounting effects and the corporate housing acquisitions on the company s operations and financial results  the company s historical results of operations and period to period comparisons will not be indicative of future results 
clearance center sales sales through the company s clearance centers of used furniture that no longer meets showroom condition standards for rental allow globe to recover a substantial portion of original cost and to maintain the freshness of rental furniture inventory 
clearance center revenues and cost recovery ratios for the last five years are presented in the following table 
years ended february  dollars in thousands clearance center sales      original cost of furniture      cost recovery ratio cost recovery ratio  former grantree operations management believes that the ability to recover a substantial portion of the original cost of its furniture through its clearance center sales is a key contributor to the company s profitability 
the improvement in the cost recovery ratio over the period is due primarily to upgrading the quality of furniture in the former grantree operations 
the decrease in the cost recovery ratio in fiscal reflects the company s disposal of excess older inventory at reduced prices to support its focus on improved inventory management 
comparison of fiscal years ended february  and february  total revenues of million increased million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to acquisitions

rental sales of million in fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal this growth resulted from significant volume increases in the california and denver markets  as well as several midwestern markets  and is partially attributable to furniture rental acquisitions in detroit and southern california which occurred during the second and third quarters of fiscal excluding the impact of intercompany eliminations  rental sales increased million  or

the company s effective tax rate  which includes federal  state and local taxes  increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal liquidity and capital resources on september   the company completed a private placement of million of unsecured senior notes due september   with interest payable semi annually on march and september principal payments of million are due annually beginning september  these senior notes may be redeemed at a premium 
also  on september   the company established a million unsecured line of credit which replaced an existing million secured line of credit 
this million line was increased on may   to million 
interest is currently the lesser of the prime rate minus basis points or libor plus basis points 
at april   the unused line was million  which is available for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the term of the line of credit will expire on september   requiring full payment of the then outstanding balance 
the company expects to have other financing arrangements in place prior to this date 
from march  through april  globe used approximately million from its lines of credit  issued  shares of common stock for fiscal acquisitions and  shares of common stock previously held in escrow for fiscal acquisitions  issued approximately million of notes payable and assumed approximately million of certain liabilities in completing six acquisitions and settling certain contingent consideration for three fiscal acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions 
other than acquisitions  the company s principal use of cash is for furniture purchases 
the company purchases furniture to replace furniture which has been sold and to maintain adequate levels of rental furniture to meet existing and new customer needs 
furniture purchases were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the lower level of purchases in fiscal reflects the company s efforts to better manage inventory levels while continuing to ensure that existing and new customer needs can be met 
as the company s growth strategies are implemented  furniture purchases are expected to increase 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenditures are largely attributable to ongoing development of computer systems and construction of a showroom warehouse facility in indianapolis  indiana during fiscal and acquisitions of property and equipment financed through capital leases and not reflected in the preceding capital expenditure data were million  million and million over the same periods 
on march   globe obtained a million mortgage note to finance the showroom warehouse facility in indianapolis 
the company can elect to fix the interest rate for a one  three  or five year period based on the corresponding treasury note rate plus basis points  currently 
the initial term of the note requires full payment of the then outstanding balance on december   however the company expects to renew the note for an additional five year period at that date 
costs to further develop the computer systems will be incurred in the next months and are anticipated to exceed million 
the systems development is expected to be financed through cash generated by operations 
remaining capital expenditures are expected to exceed million and are also expected to be funded by cash generated by operations 
any temporary cash deficiencies resulting from timing of these expenditures will be funded via the line of credit 
the company paid no material federal income tax until fiscal when it began paying alternative minimum tax 
at february   globe had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million that can be carried forward indefinitely 
in fiscal and  net cash provided by operations was million and million  respectively  generating million more cash than was necessary to fund investing activities excluding acquisitions in fiscal and million less cash than was necessary to fund investing activities excluding acquisitions in fiscal the improvement in cash flow in fiscal results primarily from higher levels of net income  depreciation and amortization and lower levels of furniture purchases and capital expenditures 
in october  globe repurchased  shares of stock for million  pursuant to an authorized million stock repurchase program 
these shares are held in treasury 
aside from acquisitions  furniture purchases  which have historically been seasonally weighted to the first half of the fiscal year  are the primary reason for use of the credit facilities 
any temporary cash deficiencies resulting from these purchases will be funded via the line of credit 
the company expects cash flow from operations plus the credit facilities to be sufficient to fund the company s needs for the foreseeable future  except for significant acquisitions and any additional repurchases that may be made under the company s stock repurchase program 
inflation and general economic conditions historically  the company has been able to offset increases in furniture prices with increases in rental rates 
management believes that increases in new furniture prices have averaged less than the overall inflation rate over the last three years and expects this trend to continue 
management believes the company will be able to offset future increases in leased corporate housing unit rents and utilities with increases in rental rates 
year the company has developed a year remediation plan and is currently evaluating the potential impact of the year issue on both its information technology systems and its non information technology systems 
the initial phases of the plan consist of planning and assessment and involve developing complete inventories of all hardware and software containing potential date sensitivity  completing vendor and customer surveys and performing a series of controlled tests to determine compliance 
the inventory phase has been completed 
the planning assessment and vendor customer survey phases are approximately complete 
the vendor and customer surveys have been sent and the results are now being compiled 
no issues have been identified to date 
the controlled tests are currently scheduled for may and june preliminary results indicate that the company s existing internal financial and operational software is year compliant  and that a moderate number of desktop computers may need to be replaced 
the corporate housing and furniture rental inventory systems currently under development have been designed to be year compliant 
globe expects to have the initial phases of the remediation plan completed by june  costs incurred to date and those anticipated to complete the initial phases are immaterial to the company s results of operations 
based upon the results of the initial phases  globe will develop a detailed remediation and contingency plan 
this plan will address such concerns as the time required to replace equipment or software and contingency plans for unforeseen year failures  including the identification of alternate vendors or financial institutions  as well as the financial resources necessary to reasonably ensure compliance by the year it is expected that this plan will be completed by september  costs associated with this phase are not expected to exceed million 
while globe is not aware of exposures related to the operations of customers or vendors and it does not have a relationship with any third party vendor which is material to its operations  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner or that the failure to convert would not have an adverse impact on globe s operations 
costs associated with any such failure cannot be reasonably estimated
