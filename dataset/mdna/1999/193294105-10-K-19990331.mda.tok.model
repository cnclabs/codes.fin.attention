these include the purchase of wholesale and retail inventories in anticipation of increased wholesale sales and new store openings and capital expenditures related to the expansion  renovation and construction of retail and outlet stores 
the company relies upon internally generated cash flows from operations and borrowings under its line of credit facility to finance its operations and growth 
cash flows may vary from time to time as a result of seasonal requirements of inventory  the timing of the receipt of merchandise from suppliers  the company s open stock inventory program which requires increased inventory levels and the level of accounts receivable balances 
at december   working capital was million compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased licensing revenues and higher earnings offset by increased inventory levels required to support significant sales growth in men s footwear and for the initial inventory requirements of the new retail and outlet stores

net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the changes in net cash used in financing activities principally reflect the amounts expended in the company s stock repurchase program  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
as of march   the company had purchased  shares of the  shares authorized under its stock repurchase program 
the company currently sells substantially all of its account receivables to one factor without recourse 
in circumstances where a customer s account cannot be factored without recourse  the company may take other measures to reduce its credit exposure which could include requiring the customer to pay in advance or to provide a letter of credit covering the sales price of the merchandise ordered 
the company currently has a line of credit  as amended  under which up to million is available to finance working capital requirements and letters of credit to finance the company s inventory purchases 
borrowings available under the line of credit are determined by a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories and bear interest at i the higher of the bank of new york s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus at the date of borrowing or ii a negotiated rate 
in connection with the line of credit  the company has agreed to eliminate all the outstanding borrowings under the facility for at least consecutive days during each calendar year 
in addition  borrowings under the line of credit are secured by certain receivables of the company

capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
expenditures on furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements for new retail store openings and expansions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the remaining expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvements  information systems and equipment for the company s offices and warehouse 
during  the company anticipates opening or expanding approximately to retail and outlet stores that will require aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company also expects to spend approximately million for the initial inventory requirements of these new stores 
the company also anticipates that it will require increased capital expenditures to support its continued growth including an increase in its office space and enhancements to its management information systems 
in december  the company entered into a year lease which  over a period of three to five years  will provide the company with approximately  square feet of office space  enabling it to relocate its corporate headquarters to a larger location in new york city and consolidate various satellite office space 
currently  the timing of the turnover of space is indeterminable and the company does not expect to begin its phased relocation until early in however  the company expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately to million over the next three to five years 
year the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain information technology systems and their associated software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations  system failures or other computer errors 
in addition  like every other business  the company is at risk from year failures on the part of its major business suppliers  distributors  licensees as well as potential failures from public and private infrastructure service providers 
system failures resulting from the year problem could adversely effect operations and financial results in all of the company s business segments 
failures may cause loss of electric power or certain communication links  disruptions to business operations including delayed deliveries from suppliers  disruptions to the channels of distribution as well as disruptions to the company s own distribution center and retailing operations 
the company believes that by replacing  rather than reprogramming  its wholesale distribution and financial systems with newer technologically advanced systems that offer greater functionality and enhanced reporting  the year problem will be mitigated 
however  if such replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year problem could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has adopted a five phase year program consisting of the following phase i identification of the components of the company s systems  equipment and suppliers that may be vulnerable to year problems  phase ii assessment of items identified in phase i  phase iii remediation or replacement of non compliant systems  phase iv testing of systems and components following replacement  and phase v developing contingency plans 
the company has completed phase i and phase ii 
phase iii remediation or replacement of non compliant systems 
this phase involves creating plans  providing necessary resources and executing remedial strategies 
the company s critical systems are being replaced with newer advanced systems that are already year compliant 
the company s financial systems have been implemented  tested and turned on effective january  the wholesale selling and distribution system is warranteed as year compliant and is scheduled to be implemented during the second quarter of all systems are expected to be reliably functioning by july  phase iv testing of systems and components following replacement 
this phase includes testing functionality and system compliance 
of the company s information systems  the financial  warehousing and edi systems currently in place have been tested and are year compliant 
the company s retail systems  which are run by a third party provider  have been warranteed as year compliant and the company s point of sale and credit card processing have been successfully tested 
the company is working with its wholesale and distribution systems software provider to program enhanced functionality designed specifically for fashion footwear businesses 
however  the existing standard base system is year compliant and is capable of running the company s business 
the updated system is planned to be implemented during the second quarter of phase v contingency planning 
this phase addresses any remaining open issues expected in and thereafter 
based upon its efforts to date  the company believes that all of its critical information technology and non information technology will remain up and running beyond january  accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that internal systems failures will result in any material adverse effect to its operations or financial condition 
as a contingency plan for its wholesale and distribution systems that are not yet implemented  the company plans on implementing the existing standard base system  which is certified year compliant and has already been installed and tested by the company 
third party relationships 
in addition to addressing the company s internal systems and equipment  the company is communicating with significant suppliers  vendors and other third parties with whom the company has a significant business relationship with  to determine their state of readiness with respect to year to date  the company is not aware of any third party with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations 
however  failure of significant suppliers  vendors or other third parties to timely address and remedy year problems or to develop and effect appropriate contingency plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
various fallback plans are being considered  including the use of electronic spreadsheets and manual work arounds eg  written purchase orders and bulk distributions 
in addition  the company believes that the geographically disbursed nature of its business and its large supplier and vendor base mitigates such potential adverse effects 
the company does not expect the costs associated with its year efforts to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the total cost of purchasing and implementing the new information systems  including addressing the year problem is estimated at million  of which approximately  has been expensed to date and million spent on new software and hardware 
the company s cost estimates do not include costs associated with addressing and resolving issues as a result of the failure of third parties to become year compliant 
the costs of the year project are being funded through both leasing arrangements and operating cash flows 
the company believes that it will be able to satisfy its cash requirements for  including requirements for its retail expansion  new corporate office space and information systems improvements  primarily with cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its line of credit 
exchange rates the company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts in anticipation of future purchases of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the italian lira and spanish peseta 
at december   forward exchange contracts totaling million were outstanding with settlement dates ranging from january through may gains and losses on forward exchange contracts are deferred and accounted for as part of the purchase price of imported merchandise 
at december   the unrealized loss on these forward contracts is approximately  the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout the year 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations is adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
on january   the euro became the official single currency of the european economic and monetary union 
as of this date  the conversion rates of the national currencies of the union members were fixed irrevocably 
during the transition period between january and january  parties may pay for goods using either the euro or the national currency 
the company believes conversion to the euro will not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
inventory purchases from contract manufacturers in the far east and brazil are denominated in united states dollars and the recent devaluation of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may effect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse affect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
important factors relating to forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to the company s shareholders 
all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters  including the launching or prospective development of new business initiatives  year remediation efforts  future licensee sales growth  and the introduction of the euro are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
these statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions  as of the time the statements are made  regarding future events and business performance 
there can be no assurance  however  that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass 
a number of factors affecting the company s business and operations could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
those factors include  but are not limited to  demand and competition for the company s products  changes in consumer preferences on fashion trends  delays in anticipated store openings  and changes in the company s relationship with its suppliers and other resources 
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements is illustrative  but by no means exhaustive 
accordingly  readers of this annual report should consider these facts in evaluating the information and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in italian lira and spanish pesetas  both of which have been converted to the euro effective january  business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s earnings may be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its line of credit facility 
a two percent increase in interest rates affecting the company s credit facility would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income
