item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of its investments 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
