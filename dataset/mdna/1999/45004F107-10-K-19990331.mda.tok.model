item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial information  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our fiscal year was changed from the twelve month period ending march to the calendar year  effective december  overview general we manufacture land based drilling and well servicing rigs and rig component parts for use in the domestic and international markets 
our revenues are substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and worldwide levels of exploration  development and production activity  including the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity 
exploration  development and production activity is largely dependent on the prevailing view of future oil and natural gas prices which have been characterized by significant volatility over the last years 
oil and natural gas prices are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and gas  including the level of drilling activity  worldwide economic activity  interest rates and the cost of capital  environmental regulation  tax policies  political requirements of national governments  coordination by opec and the cost of producing oil and gas 
demand for our products in certain emerging market countries may depend somewhat less on the prevailing view of future oil and natural gas prices as such countries may generally place greater emphasis on their need for internal development  energy self sufficiency or hard currency earnings 
as a result of the continued decline in oil prices and the deteriorating economic conditions in russia and other emerging markets  the oil and gas industry has dramatically reduced its capital expenditures for exploration  development and production activities 
our revenues  operating income and backlog have been adversely affected by these events 
we believe that these industry conditions may further deteriorate and negatively impact our future results of operations 
accordingly  we have assessed and begun to implement a variety of measures to minimize the adverse effects of industry conditions on the our business and financial performance 
we consolidated our manufacturing operations in pampa and houston  texas and implemented other cost reduction measures 
these measures reduced our workforce by a total of employees through march we are considering further consolidation and cost reduction measures but we cannot assure that these or any other measures will be sufficient to offset the negative effects of prevailing industry conditions on the our business and financial performance 
foreign exchange transactions sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars are made only by the bowen tools division 
we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount of sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars and by  with the exception of our canadian subsidiary  maintaining our cash and cash equivalents in us dollar denominated accounts and investments except to the extent needed for local operating expenses 
for the twelve month period december  and the fiscal years ended december  and  bowen s canadian sales expressed in us dollars were million  million and million  respectively  and all other non us dollar denominated sales expressed in us dollars were million  million and million  respectively 
we have not engaged in and do not currently intend to engage in any significant hedging or currency trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations among foreign currencies 
negative goodwill on september   all of our outstanding capital stock was acquired by an affiliate of certain of our stockholders for million in cash the company acquisition 
the company acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the company acquisition 
the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the consideration paid was applied against non monetary assets property  plant and equipment  reducing the balances of these assets at the date of the company acquisition to zero  and the remaining excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over consideration paid was recorded as negative goodwill 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based up on their fair values at the date of the acquisition as follows in thousands inventories  other current assets  current liabilities  accrued retirement benefits  negative goodwill  negative goodwill is being amortized using the straight line method over five years ending september  the comparability of the results of operations between the years ended march  which included the results of operations of our predecessor from april  to september  and march  is affected by  in addition to the amortization of negative goodwill which reduces the post company acquisition cost of sales  the exclusion of depreciation expense related to fixed assets written down to zero on the company acquisition date  both of which have a positive effect on earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of negative goodwill decreased cost of goods sold by million in each of the fiscal years ended december  and and the twelve month period ended december  and the year ended march  and million for the period from september  through march  results of operations in june  we changed our fiscal year from a march year end to a december year end  effective with the period ended december   in order to harmonize the fiscal years of iri  cardwell and bowen 
the following discussion of the results of operations of our business units does not reflect allocation of corporate overhead expense  unallocated administrative expense or amortization of goodwill and negative goodwill 
see note to our financial statements for a presentation of segment information 
sales of new rigs manufactured by us can produce large fluctuations in revenues depending on the size and the timing of the construction of orders 
individual orders of rig packages range from million to million and cycle times for the design  engineering and manufacturing or rig packages range from six to nine months 
these fluctuations may affect our quarterly revenues and operating income 
the lack of material tax provisions for the historical periods discussed below results primarily from i the amortization of negative goodwill which does not give rise to taxable income and ii the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
as discussed above  negative goodwill is being amortized over five years ending september  see negative goodwill 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
results of segment operations the following discussion of the results of operations of our oil field equipment  down hole tools and specialty steel segments does not reflect the allocation of corporate and unallocated administrative expenses  amortization of negative goodwill and amortization of goodwill on an individual segment basis 
certain information that reconciles the discussion of the results of operations of the individual segments to the our consolidated financial statements is as follows the company predecessor period from twelve months nine months september  period from ended ended april  december  december  year ended through through march  march  september  revenues oil field equipment         down hole tools   specialty steel         total         segment operating income loss oil field equipment        down hole tools   specialty steel        total        corporate overhead and unallocated administrative expenses         restructuring charge amortization of negative goodwill        amortization of goodwill  operating income loss         fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  oil field equipment revenues and operating income for the oil field equipment unit were million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december  decreased operating income resulted from the economic and financial turmoil in russia and the asia pacific region and the downward turn in oil prices  both of which resulted in a decreased demand for our products 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to for the fiscal year ended december  this increase resulted principally from an extensive cost restructuring program and a favorable mix between manufactured equipment and buy outs 
down hole tools revenues and operating income for the down hole tools unit were million or million per month and million or million per month  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million or million per month and million or million per month  respectively  for the nine months ended december  decreased monthly revenues at the down hole tools unit were primarily attributable to the downward trends in the oil industries 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in monthly operating income and gross margin was primarily due to the full impact of price increases in the last two quarters of  an increase in the amount of manufacturing overhead absorbed into inventory and management s cost cutting initiatives 
specialty steel revenues and operating income for the specialty steel unit were million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily the result of reduced demand from a major customer 
because of the loss of the high margin business that we transacted with this major customer  our gross margins also decreased from for the fiscal year ended december  to for the fiscal year ended december  corporate administrative and interest expenses corporate administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of corporate administrative expenses for our bowen tools division and cardwell operations for the full year in as compared to only nine months for in addition  corporate administrative expenses increased as a result of the higher professional fees associated with being a public company and the implementation of new software systems 
interest expense decreased from million for the fiscal year ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended december  interest expense decreased mainly because we repaid our debt with the proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock 
restructuring charge the company incurred a restructuring charge of  in in connection with its restructuring program 
other income expense other expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  other expense for includes million of interest income due to higher cash balances in  million of losses on trading securities as compared to a gain of million for  million of special charges relating to expenses incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of hitec asa  which was terminated on april   and million of miscellaneous other expenses 
fiscal year ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  oil field equipment revenues and operating income for the oil field equipment unit were million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the twelve month period ended december  for the fiscal year ended december   revenues and operating income reflect contributions thereto by cardwell of million and million 
the increase in revenues resulted from the cardwell acquisition and increased sales of rig packages by the iri division 
increased operating income resulted from the iri division s increased sales in the period 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to for the twelve month period ended december  this decrease resulted principally from the inclusion of cardwell s operations gross margin of in the results for the twelve month period ended december  
cardwell s comparatively lower gross margin resulted from lower margin rig manufacturing contracts entered into prior to the date of the cardwell acquisition  the pricing terms of which reflected cardwell s lower fixed overhead cost structure 
we have implemented a uniform pricing policy that we believe will result in higher overall gross margins 
down hole tools we acquired the bowen tools division on march  and prior to such date we had no down hole tools unit 
revenues and operating income for the down hole tools unit were million and million  respectively  for the nine months ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the nine months ended december  increased revenues and operating income at the bowen tools division were primarily attributable to increased drilling activity in the us gross margin for the nine months ended december  was  as compared to for the nine months period ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved pricing  increased volume and more efficient capacity utilization 
specialty steel revenues and operating income for the specialty steel unit were million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the twelve month period ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily the result of reduced demand from a major customer 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to for the twelve month period ended december  corporate administrative and interest expenses corporate administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of bowen and cardwell s administrative expenses of million and million  respectively  for the period 
interest expense increased from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in interest expense is a result of i borrowings on march  under a million five year term loan the term loan provided to us by certain financial institutions  as lenders  credit lyonnais new york branch  as a lender and as administrative agent  and lehman commercial paper inc  as a lender and as advisor  manager and syndication agent collectively  the lenders  and the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated increasing rate notes the senior notes on such date to fund the acquisitions and ii borrowings under a million three year revolving credit facility between us and the lenders with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the revolving credit facility during the period to fund working capital requirements of cardwell 
on november   we used the gross proceeds of the initial public offering of the common stock to repay in full the term loan and fully redeem the senior notes 
nine months ended december  compared to nine months ended december  oil field equipment revenues and operating income for the oil field equipment unit were million and million  respectively  for the nine month period ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the nine month period ended december  the increases in revenues and operating income were primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our oil field equipment products to exploration and production companies and contract drillers 
the elevated levels of sales of our products reflected the increased oil and gas exploration and production activity worldwide 
gross margin for the nine month period ended december  was compared to for the nine month period ended december   as a result of price increases  greater fixed overhead absorption and more efficient capacity utilization due to increased manufacturing volume 
specialty steel revenues and operating income for the specialty steel unit were million and million respectively  for the nine month period ended december   as compared to million and million  respectively  for the nine month period ended december  the increases in revenues and operating income were primarily the result of increased sales to steel service centers and a major customer 
gross margin for the nine month period ended december  was  as compared to for the nine month period ended december   as a result of more efficient capacity utilization 
corporate administrative and interest expenses corporate administrative expenses were million  representing of revenues  for the nine month period ended december  and million  representing of revenues  for the nine month period ended december  the higher levels of expense were a consequence of establishing a corporate headquarters in houston  texas  and expanding our management team and related support personnel 
interest expense was million for the nine month period ended december   compared to million of interest income for the nine month period ended december   due to borrowings by us under a former credit facility established in april the funds borrowed were used by us to fund increased working capital needs necessitated by the increases in the orders for its oil field equipment products during the nine month period ended december  accounting policies in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  this statement requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  at december   our working capital was million  compared to million at december  this increase in working capital at december  was attributable to the increase in manufactured inventories 
at december   our current assets to current liabilities ratio was approximately at december   approximately million was available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash flows from operations in conjunction with borrowings under the revolving credit facility and credit facilities that may be arranged in the future  if necessary  will be sufficient to meet our short term ie  less than one year and long term liquidity needs 
though there can be no assurance in this regard  we believe that any credit facilities arranged in the near future would be on commercially reasonable terms 
the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility matures on march   and prior thereto amounts repaid may be reborrowed 
after the initial public offering of our common stock  we reduced the commitment under the revolving credit facility to million 
our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of our assets  including all personal property and material real property  the pledge by us of all of the outstanding capital stock of cardwell and the pledge by us or cardwell  as the case may be  of of the outstanding capital stock of each of our direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries 
these obligations are also guaranteed by cardwell 
the revolving credit facility contains certain representations and warranties  covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type 
year our year compliance program we have initiated a three phase year compliance program we will identify non year compliant hardware and software systems and other technology  and contact key suppliers and customers  we will ascertain the extent to which our systems and technologies and those of our key suppliers and customers are non year compliant and will prioritize our year response accordingly  and we will replace or remediate our non year compliant systems and technologies and develop contingency plans with respect to systems and other technology that cannot be replaced or remediated in time and with respect to key suppliers and customers that have not become year compliant 
our state of readiness the first phase is currently in progress and should be complete by the end of the second quarter 
of the inventory taken thus far  we have identified issues with some of our information technology systems that support our most significant business operations 
the enterprise resource planning erp system that supports the down hole tools unit requires a software upgrade that is planned for installation by the end of the second quarter of the erp system that supports the oil field equipment and specialty steel units also requires a software upgrade that is planned for installation in the third quarter of the installation of these software upgrades will require the allocation of significant internal resources to test the upgraded erp systems prior to their implementation 
other significant information technology systems that may not be compliant are the accounting software system currently used in the canadian operations  our payroll system  and the design engineering software system 
we will have a better understanding of these systems and their respective year compliance once we have completed the first phase of our year compliance program 
we have inventoried some of the more critical non information technology systems of the down hole tools unit 
approximately of our production machines for the down hole tools unit are manual or numerical control equipment not affected by year issues 
the balance of our production machines are computer numerical control machines  these machines produce about to of our production output 
although we have been notified by the manufacturer of these machines that the controls on these machines are year compliant  we have not yet verified whether or not these machines are indeed year compliant 
we have not completed our inventory of the production machines for our other units or other non information technology systems 
we have also initiated the inventorying of key third party relationships for year compliance 
although we have begun to contact some of the key suppliers of the down hole tools unit  we have not yet assessed the extent and content of the responses received from those suppliers 
we have not begun to inventory the key customers for any of the business units and the key suppliers for the oil field equipment unit and the specialty steel unit but we believe that the loss of any of our suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we plan to complete the inventory of key third party relationships by the end of the second quarter of we have retained outside consultants to help evaluate our year readiness and our comprehensive project plan detailing the steps necessary for us to become year compliant 
we expect the report and project plan to be ready by the middle of the second quarter of we intend to complete our inventory of all information technology and non information technology related systems by the end of the second quarter of we also expect to engage outside consultants to assist us in the testing of our systems and the remediation of any year issues 
costs to address year issues to date  the costs incurred by our year compliance program have been minimal 
we estimate our expenses relating to year issues will be approximately million  but they could be as high as million 
we also expect to allocate significant internal resources to the inventorying  testing and remediation of year issues  though we have not quantified the costs of allocating these internal resources 
the replacement and upgrade of several of our software and hardware systems in the ordinary course of business have had the added benefit of resolving year issues with respect to those systems 
in addition  our maintenance agreements with vendors of our erp systems for our three business units already include the cost of the software upgrades required for those systems 
we believe that the costs to complete our year compliance program will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  though we cannot give any assurances in this regard 
risks associates with year issues we believe that much of the risk associated with year will be mitigated by the installation of the minor software patches on our erp systems 
however  we are presently unable to fully determine the risk of any other non compliant year software  hardware  and other technologies and the material impact it represents to our business 
we will have a better understanding of these risks once the inventory has been completed and the systems have been analyzed and prioritized with respect to their importance to our business 
we are unable to determine what effect the failure of us  our suppliers or our customers to become year compliant will have on our business  but any significant failures could have an material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
at the very least  any significant failures may force us to curtail production  prevent us from meeting customers demands on a timely basis  and or impede our ability to monitor customer orders and inventory 
contingency plans we have not yet been able to determine the extent to which we need contingency plans because our inventory is not yet complete 
we plan to have contingency plans developed by the end of the third quarter of for all those systems and relationships that are critical to our business 
all non critical systems and relationships will be assessed for contingency plans in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended december   we used cash flow from operations of million primarily to increase inventory levels to support anticipated increases in sales 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations 
capital expenditures for totaled million  including million for the oilfield equipment and specialty steel segments  of which million was for data processing equipment and million was for machinery and equipment 
million in capital expenditures was expended for rental tools and equipment and new machinery at our down hole tools segment 
for  we have budgeted capital expenditures of million  including million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for rental tools and million for software upgrades and related expenditures 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded with available cash and cash flow generated from operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this discussion of about our exposure to market risks and our risk management activities includes forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including economic and competitive factors outside our control 
our primary market risk exposures come from interest rate risks  foreign exchange rate risks  and equity price risks 
our exposure to interest rate risks in minimal with respect to indebtedness 
we repaid substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness in november however  at december   we had approximately million of cash in interest bearing accounts 
the rate of return on these accounts will vary with the prevailing interest rates 
we do not engage in any significant interest rate swaps or other derivative activities designed to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our direct exposure to foreign exchange risks is minimal 
except as discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with respect to our bowen tools division  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
however  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may affect our revenues indirectly to the extent that a stronger us dollar affects our ability to compete on the basis of price 
we do not engage in any significant hedging or currency trading activities to limit our sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and or interest rates 
at december   we had approximately million of marketable securities  consisting primarily of corporate equity securities 
these securities were acquired principally for trading purposes and are bought and held by us for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices may adversely affect the value of our marketable securities 
we do not believe there has been any material change in the market risks faced by us since the end of
