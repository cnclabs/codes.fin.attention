the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system problems or failures 
zomax has developed a year plan  the objective of which is to determine and assess the risks of the year issue  and plan and institute corrective actions to minimize those risks 
the company s goal is to ensure current business operations will continue to function accurately with no material disruption into and beyond year the company has formed internal review teams and has engaged an independent year consulting firm to assist and advise it regarding year compliance
